Review for Payback (1999)
Payback is a style-over-substance film and being so it falls into two
distinct categories: the occasional good one that is highly entertaining
or, more often then not, one that completely fails to entertain and realize
only on style to skate by. Which is Payback? And does Payback succeed in
entertaining? 
Porter (Mel Gibson) is a bad guy, a really bad guy. We see how bad he is as
the movie opens. He picks pockets, he steals from the homeless, and he
doesn't tip waitresses. He's not a likeable guy by any means, but he's the
guy we're stuck with throughout the film. Cool! For once we don't have to
follow some ultra-goodie-two-shoes through a film. And this is a nice twist.
So, what's Porter's rub with the world? After robbing some Chinese mobsters
of $140,000 using a car and a big crash, Porter is shot and left for dead
by his partner in crime and best friend, Val (Gregg Henry). Val steals
Porter's $70,000 share of the stolen money. Porter is not dead though and
he is out to get his $70,000, no more, no less. As it turns out that Val is
part of the mob, or as known in the film as "the outfit", but was kicked
out. Val buys himself back into the outfit with the stolen money. Now, not
only does Porter have to deal with Val and the Chinese mobsters, he has the
outfit on his back also. During the film, Porter rekindles a relationship
with a hooker, Rosie (Maria Bello), whom he used to know and she is key to
Porter's plans of revenge.
Gibson doesn't do anything special in Payback. His character Porter is
nothing more than his Lethal Weapon character Martin Riggs gone bad. Gibson
can do this kind of role with his eyes closed; a maniac guy who has no real
care for his life, but has subtle humour within.
There are two performers to look for in Payback: Maria Bello and William
Devane. The last time I saw Bello was on ER last season. She is wonderful
in Payback as the only friend that Porter has. I hope to see Bello in more
films soon. Devane is the best thing Payback has. His onscreen presence is
a hoot and a holler. I wish that he had more screen time because he had one
juicy and funny part. Watch for the scene where he puts on lip-gloss.
Devane takes this scene over-the-top and it turns out to be one of the
funniest scenes in the film.
Payback is the first film helmed by Brian Helgeland who is better known for
his writing: The Postman, L.A. Confidential, and Assassins. He has a steady
hand at directing, but he still needs a bit of work at keeping and
maintaining tone. At times, the film switches tones abruptly and these
switches feel out of place. From time to time the film will go from serious
to humourous, not working its way into the humour. This left the audience,
and myself, unable to catch some of the humour. There are some funny bits
in this film, but they are lost to Helgeland's inability to integrate them
well with the serious portions of the film.
The script by Helgeland and Terry Hayes, based on Richard Starks's book The
Hunter, is nothing special. I do like how snappy the dialogue was, but next
to that, this is just a film about a bad guy getting revenge on bad people.
What makes Payback stick out is the bluish tint that is added to the film
noir look. This bluish tint comes from the process in which the film was
developed. And it is this look that makes up for most of Paybacks style 
the film is a work of art.
One thing that stuck out as strange was Lucy Liu's presence in the film.
She basically takes her character from Fox's Ally McBeal and turns it up a
notch. The sight of her in the film is quite jarring and as I overheard one
audience member say, "That Ally McBeal girl being in this film was corny."
But, it was cool hearing her say, "Hubba hubba."
Payback does succeed in entertaining, though it's mostly pulp
entertainment. The minute you step out of the theatre, most of the film
will have slipped from memory. Catch Payback at a matinee showing to see
the performances of Maria Bello and William Devane. A warningto those who
are weak at the heart, if you're squeamish to violence then Payback is not
for you. There are multiple scenes of heavy and graphic violence. Plus,
there is some graphic torture scenes.

Review for Ransom (1996)
A few months back I saw the preview for this film.  It looked exciting, 
thrilling, and cool.  And I really like Mel Gibson, Rene Russo, and Delroy 
Lindo.  Then I saw that I was directed by Ron Howard, what other great thing 
could this film have?  And this is when the waiting started.
Today, after my physics lab I stood in line for fifteen minutes to buy tickets 
to the very first showing of Ransom at Century 22 (San Jose, CA).  Then sat in 
a dimly lit theatre waiting for the projectionist to finish up loading the 
film.  Watched three previews (one being Star Trek:First Contact) and then the 
lights dimmed.  Was the film worth the wait?  A definite YES!
What a great film.  Ron Howard (also known as Opie) does a very good job 
directing this film, making everything work well together.  The well paid Mel 
Gibson ($20 million) does a great job at being a guy that has fast mood 
swings and almost seem to care only about himself.  Rene Russo looks great, as 
always, and does great as Mel Gibson's wife.  The characterizations in the 
film were somewhat thin, but the quick pacing of the film moves the audience 
along so fast that it really doesn't matter.
The plot of the film is about Tom Mullen (Mel Gibson), an airline tycoon, who 
did one nasty deed in his past.  The kidnappers, I won't reveal the 
identities, take Mullen's kid and ask for a $2 million dollar ransom.  We 
find later, how that nasty deed really fits into the situation.  
The film also stars Gary Sinese (Forrest Gump, Apollo 13)  as a NYPD detective 
and  Delroy Lindo (Broken Arrow, Get Shorty) as an FBI agent.  I really loved 
Delroy Lindo's performance in this film.
Though we all know how the film is going to turn out, there are enough twists, 
turns, and surprises throughout the film to keep the audience hooked all the 
way up to the end.  This is a great film.  Put it on your "Must-see" list!

Review for Ghostbusters (1984)
The true test of a film is time. If a film can hold up through the passing
of years, then as more years pass the more great the film becomes.
Ghostbusters has stood the test of time. Producing a sequel and a cartoon
series.
Ghostbusters is about three offbeat scientists, Peter Venkman (Bill
Murray), Raymond Stanz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis), who
have just lost their university grant and are out on the street. What do
they do now? They pursue an idea that they can catch ghosts and retain them.
The movie follows the three and also Sigourney Weaver's character, Dana
Barrett. Woven in the movie are three plots. The main plot of the film is
the Ghostbusters trying to figure out why there are so many ghosts lately
in New York. The two subplots are the love story between Venkman and
Barrett. And the evil EPA man (William Antherton) trying to shutdown the
Ghostbusters.
The real joy of The Ghostbusters is the comic interaction between the three
(and later four) Ghostbusters. The well-written script by Dan Aykroyd and
Harold Ramis gives each character a distinct, sharp, and intelligent
personality. The other joy of the film is the incredible special effect by
Richard Edlund. Even now, over a decade since its release, the special
effects are impressive.
All actors give great performances. Bill Murray as Dr. Venkman is probably
my most favorite of the four Ghostbusters. Like always, Murray is off the
deep end in his performance, sometimes his performance seems almost
adlibbed. Dan Aykroyd gets one of his best and most memorable roles as Dr.
Stanz. His character is giddy and naive, which makes him very likeable.
Harold Ramis gives a performance that turns Dr. Spangler into the unlike
looking nerd. Ernie Hudson is not given enough time on screen, and I think
his character could have gotten more, his character brought the layman into
the Ghostbusters group. Sigourney Weaver does well in her role, but it is
her neighbor Louis Tully, played by Rick Moranis who does better. His nerd
accounting character is wonderfully funny and provides for a lot of laughs.
If you haven't seen The Ghostbusters, I highly recommend this film. Even if
you've seen it awhile ago, see it again. Director Ivan Reitman and
cinematographer László Kovács uses the width of the movie screen to its
fullest, often framing a shot from end to end. Watching The Ghostbusters in
Pan and Scan format takes away from the film. Definitely catch The
Ghostbusters in widescreen format, or you'll be missing out on a lot.
(Criterion offers The Ghostbusters in widescreen format on laserdisc). This
is a don't miss film.

Review for There's Something About Mary (1998)
I don't remember the last time I laughed this hard at a movie. There's
Something About Mary is one of the funniest movies I've seen lately.
The story is simple. There's a girl named Mary, who everyone thinks is a
fox. Guys will do anything to get Mary - everyone except for Ted, a
genuinely nice guy who had a mishap with Mary while in high school. Now,
thirteen years later, Ted wants to find Mary and maybe get back together
with her.
Mary is about the only character in There's Something About Mary that is
sane. Played by the beautiful Cameron Diaz, Mary is the object of lust for
all the on-screen men. Diaz does a good job with her part, projecting a
naive, appealing warmth. Opposite Mary is Ted, played by Ben Stiller. Ted's
life is an absolute mess - everything that could go wrong for Ted does go
wrong. Stiller is hilarious as Ted.
The script by Ed Decter & John J. Strauss and Peter Farrelly & Bobby
Farrelly definitely deserves its R rating; the gross sexual humor makes
this movie unfit for kids.
Direction from the Farrelly brothers is good, though at points they seem to
lose focus and drift. The movie does have its slow moments - moments in
which I found myself looking at my watch wondering either when the movie
would end or when the next laugh-out-loud-sequence was going to appear.
Speaking of laugh-out-loud-sequences, an early scene is hilarious. The
scene consists of Ted, a bathroom, and a stubborn zipper. The Farrelly
brothers leave nothing to the imagination with this scene. A lot of what
happens in the opening is shown in trailers, but there are some sight gags
that are not (and couldn't be) shown during trailers. There are other
moments, like the one with a dog on speed and a hair gel incident that left
the audience howling. Small moments with a singing duel are silly. And
there's a scene with fake nudity that will shock you.
There's Something About Mary is a film that will not suit everyone. There
will be those who think that this crude humor really doesn't belong in
theatres. But, if you're willing to let go of some of your respectability
when you walk into the theatre, you'll love There's Something About Mary.
The guy who sat next to me during the screening kept screaming, "Oh, that's
just not right!" Right or not, it was funny. Don't Miss There's Something
About Mary.
On a side note, I think that the advertising for There's Something About
Mary was skewed a bit, which resulted in my seeing the film this late.
"Warning The guys who did 'Dumb & Dumber' and 'Kingpin' bring you a love
story." That is what the ads said and I took heed of the warning because I
didn't like Dumb & Dumber at all. And I'm sure there are many who didn't
either. For the record, There's Something Like Mary is a lot more enjoyable
than Dumb & Dumber. I regret seeing the film so late.

Title
Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
Lethal Weapon 4 is like a ten year high school reunion, or at least what
I've heard about them everyone is older and overweight But, the good thing
is the familiarity with everyone and Lethal Weapon 4 has familiarity. From
the director, Richard Donner, who directed all four films, to most of the
actors, everything old is new in Lethal Weapon 4.
Lethal Weapon 4 is more like the third film than the first two. The first
two had substance that accompanied the action. For instance, in the first
movie, there was a genuine character development scene -- Rigg's first
dinner at the Murtaugh house. The second matched the first, an action film
with substance. The third, though, was a straightforward action movie.
Many didn't like the third, and I rank it last also, although it was fun.
Lethal Weapon 4 is also just about action, with no real character
development and no substance.
What makes the Lethal Weapon films so popular is what looks at first to be
a cliched but later turns to be original, relationship between Murtaugh and
Riggs. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson are perfectly cast in the respective
roles. The relationship between Murtaugh and Riggs is reduced to a bunch of
onscreen quips and onliners staring with the third film. In the first two,
the humor came from the situations, while the third and now fourth rely
mostly on oneliners to get laughs. With this in mind, the big draw for the
"new" Lethal Weapon, starting with Lethal Weapon 3, franchise is action.
And with Lethal Weapon 4 director Richard Donner does not disappoint.
If you liked the first two and thought the third was complete action fluff,
than you might not enjoy this fourth installment. However, if you go see
Lethal Weapon 4 strictly for action you will walk out happy. The best
action scenes are those in which we get to see the restrained Jet Li. But
also watch for the scene with Gibson that uses a big rig, a long piece of
plastic, and a table.
Jet Li , like Jackie Chan and Chow Yun-Fat, is a world renowned action star
-- except in the US. Lethal Weapon 4 marks his introduction to the
Hollywood movie market. And what an introduction it is. Li is a kick-butt
martial artist who has better moves than Jackie and as much film coolness
as Chow. His martial arts scenes feel restrained, though. He can beat the
living daylights out of both Gibson and Glover with just his pinky, but
he's held back because he's the bad guy.
Gibson and Glover are back doing Riggs and Murtaugh. Neither are doing much
new, but that's what I expected. Among the returning players are Renee
Russo and Joe Pesci. Russo is, next to Li, the best thing in this movie,
bringing a freshness to her role. Pesci should win some award for most
annoying performance this year. OK, OK, OK? The newcomer is Chris Rock and
he brings some freshness to this aging series.
But let's get to the most important thing the action. The action is
incredible. First, as I mentioned before, Jet Li is a very cool addition.
But, Donner has a natural eye for action and he has a bunch of standout
sequences in the film. Lethal Weapon 4 is not a deep, though provoking
movie it's an action fluff movie.
Ultimately, there will be Lethal Weapon 1 and 2 lovers who will disregard
Lethal Weapon 4 as a rushed-for-the-money sequel, but it is also a fun
film. There are three things to see Lethal Weapon 4 for first is the
amazing Jet Li. He brought "oohs" and "ahhs" to the audience I saw the film
with. Second is Renee Russo, who is just cool. And third is the action.
There are action sequences in Lethal Weapon 4 that are memorable. Lethal
Weapon 4 gets a big recommendation from me. This is action-fluff at its best.

Title
Review for In & Out (1997)
Some movies are bettered remembered by their trailers. In & Out is almost
that kind of movie. The trailer for In & Out is hilarious and reveals a
large chunk of the movie. Can the movie itself stand up to the trailer?
Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is an English teacher in the small town of
Greenleaf, Indiana. He wears a goofy bow tie and loves Barbra Streisand. He
is getting married in a few days, this after being engaged to his fiancée,
Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), for three years. Howard's life is pretty
uneventful. That is until a former student, Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon),
blurts out that Howard is gay during his Oscar acceptance speech. This puts
a big spin on Howard's life. In come the media, friends, and family asking
if Howard really is gay. Howard denies it at first, but then starts to
confront the issue. And both him and we are trying to figure out if he's
gay or not.
In & Out is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing hard at times, but,
there were some lulls. Kevin Kline is hilarious as Howard Brackett. He uses
some pretty amusing body language in his portrayal of Howard. As a student
tells him, "Watch the hand thing." As Howard tries to find out who he
really is, he tries a do-it-yourself package on exploring your manliness.
As he taps his feet and throws his arms in the air to start dancing the
tape tells him, "Truly manly men don't dance."
Tom Selleck is a gay reporter covering the news extravaganza, and he does a
good job with his somewhat limited role. Debbie Reynolds is absolutely
psychotic as Howard's mother.
The real star of In & Out is Joan Cusack as Howard's three-year fiancée
Emily. Cusack is the psychotic and unstable Emily who looks like she is
going to go nuts at any given moment. As psychotic and unstable as Emily
is, Cusack makes Emily very innocent, and willing to do anything for
Howard, including losing 75 pounds for the wedding.
Frank Oz has a great sense of comic timing and keeps the laughs rolling,
even up to half way through the credits. The macho man ending to the film
leaves the audience with a silly grin walking out the door. Though, the
ending events are somewhat contrived, but they work to make for a happy
ending.
Though I loved the trailers, the movie is not a letdown. In & Out has its
small flaws but in the end, the humor overshadows the flaws. In & Out is a
hilarious film that I highly recommend. This is a must see movie.

Title
Review for Powder (1995)
The less of Powder is that less is more.  Powder is a film that is able to
work its magic on the audience in a Spielbergian way in which each and
every scene is designed to manipulate the audience's feelings.
Powder opens with a hospital scene that introduces us to the character in
which the film is named after.  Powder is a completely bald albino boy that
possesses powers that are beyond what normal humans have.  His mother dies
in labor and his father disowns him when he sees that Power is an albino.
Powder is raised and home schooled by his grandparents.  When his
grandparents perish, Powder is taken under the care of Jessie (Mary
Steenburgen).
Jessie immediately sends Powder to a reform school - which baffled me, but
I went along with it.  In the reform school Powder shows his special powers
to bullies which instead of frightening them off makes them even bigger
bullies (for the record, if I saw what Powder did in the cafeteria, I'd run
for my life).  There are other things that bothered me a little about the
way the story was told.  One was how the characters of the film faded in
and out of the film.  For instance Jeff Goldblum's character is introduced
then disappears for thirty minutes.
As for performances, the one that surprised me was Lance Henriksen.  I'm
used to seeing Henriksen in less emotionally necessary parts (Aliens, Hard
Target, Terminator) and his performance as the Sheriff was completely
different from the roles that I'm accustomed to seeing him in.  Henriksen
does very well with the part that he is given.  Steenburgen and Goldblum
are given parts that don't give them much to work with.  Goldblum does try
his best to inject some energy into the material he's given.  As for Sean
Patrick Flarney as Powder, he gives a decent performance as Powder.
Flarney gave enough of a performance to hold my attention.  This movie is
not high on character development instead this movie rests on something else.
That something is the manipulation of our emotions.  Every scene is
meticulously setup to take us in a different emotional avenue.  By the end
of the film, because of the emotional roller coaster that this film is it
has us in tears.
Worth mentioning about Powder is the wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith.
The score by Goldsmith works with the emotional roller coaster to enhance,
and at times is, the emotional center of the scene.  Goldsmith is one of
Hollywood's hardest working composers and it is nice to see that he not
only scored this film, but he also conducted it.  Kudos to Goldsmith for a
wonderful score.
The script by director Victor Salva doesn't take any risks when it comes to
the film.  I'm sure that this film would have looked, felt, and acted
different if someone a bit quirkier had taken the reigns of the film.  The
name that immediately comes to mind is Tim Burton.  I think that in the
hands of Burton this film would have been darker and more risky in its
approach to the character of Powder.  Salva does well with Powder though,
he is a bit too "Hollywood" in his approach to the film - it feels much
like a paint-by-the-numbers film at times.
I screened Powder on laserdisc at the Bunker (the theatre formerly known as
the Higdon 1).  John Higdon informs me that the laserdisc is a hard to find
item nowadays, but you can find Powder on video.  Don't Miss Powder.

Title
Review for One Night Stand (1997)
After seeing Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, I was expecting a lot from One
Night Stand.  I'm sad to say that I'm sorely disappointed with One Night
Stand.
One Night Stand opens with Max Carlyle (Wesley Snipes) talking directly to
the audience, explaining some back history.  After this opening monologue,
we get into the first "act".  The first act is great.  It is a character
study of Snipes' Max and Natassja Kinski's Karen.  Max is in New York for
business and on the day that he is scheduled to fly back to Los Angeles,
where he lives, he misses his flight.  He meets Karen, who after a series
of events, ends up with Max in bed.  This first act shows the characters
well.  It is when this first act ends and the words "One Year Later" pops
up on the screen does the movie slide downhill and turn into the average
soap opera.  One year after Max and Karen's one night stand, Max's best
friend, who is gay and HIV positive, Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.) is dying.
In a freak coincident Max meets up with Karen again through a predictable
plot twist.  From here we get to see the typical "marriage on the rocks"
drama.
Figgis who takes quad-duties with One Night Stand; writing, directing,
composing the music, and producing, should have really concentrated on one
or two of these things instead of all four.  The writing, which originates
from a Joe Eszterhas (Basic Instinct) script, is mediocre at best.  The
music is, most of the time, out of place.  And the directing is off beat.
The performances by the leads are good.  Snipes does a good job with his
role as Max Carlyle, though there could have been more from him.  Kiniski
is great as Karen.  As for Robert Downey Jr. as Charlie, he is the one to
see the movie for.  Though his part in the movie is just a cheap way of
getting Max and Karen back together, Downey Jr. gives a touching
performance as the dying Charlie.  On the minor roles, Ming-Na Wen (The Joy
Luck Club) gives an average performance as Max's sex-starved wife.  And
Kyle MacLachlan (The Trigger Effect) gives a bland boring performance as
Charlie's homophobic brother.
One of my bigger complaints about One Night Stand, next to the music and
writing, is the way the camera and the cuts are handled.  Both seem sloppy,
at least to me, and the slow fades to black make the slow moving movie seem
even slower.  I think that Figgis' is trying too hard to make his films
"different" and it shows.
One Night Stand is definitely video-only material.  Leaving Las Vegas was a
great movie that did character studies on the two leads, but One Night
Stand is just a typical shallow TV soap opera made for the big screen.  And
though I enjoyed the first third or so of the film, the rest of the film is
somewhat unbearable and the plot twists are completely predictable and
silly.  Figgis should learn to concentrate more on one or two roles in the
film making process instead of trying to take the reigns at four of them.
Skip One Night Stand in the theatres and if you want to see a third of a
good film or a great performance from Robert Downey Jr., check it out on
video.

Title
Review for Jerry Maguire (1996)
I hardly cry during movies, the last one that made me really shed tears was
The Joy Luck Club. Jerry Maguire joins the ranks of a few films that have
been able to make me shed a tear.
As the film opens we find out about Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise). Jerry is a
cocky sports agent who is on top of everything. He sounds like a happy guy
until he starts to see that he hates himself and hates the place in the
world that he occupies. So, during one raining night in a hotel room, Jerry
begins to write about everything that should be done in the sport agency
business. He writes a 25-page mission statement and distributes it to
everyone in the office.
Expecting the worse, he walks into the hotel lobby the find everyone
clapping and cheering him for such a candid look at the business. A few
days later Jerry is fired.
The story goes from here to see Jerry and his fiancee, Avery (Kelly
Preston), Jerry and his only client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), and
Jerry and office assistant Dorthy Boyd (Renee Zellweger). Jerry soon breaks
off his relationship with Avery, and starts one with Dorthy.
The story follows Jerry as he changes from a man who has all heart put into
his work and no heart at home, to a man who learns to balance the two. To
contrast this, we also follow Rod Tidwell, who has all his heart at home
but none at work. We see through the movie how these two men change and
learn to change from each other.
Tom Cruise, coming off his Mission:Impossible movie, does a great job as
Jerry Maguire. I think that Cruise is better suited for this sort of role
more than the testosterone-laden role in Mission:Impossible. Cuba Gooding
Jr. puts on screen one of the best performances of the film. And is well
worth the Academy Award that he won. But the true standout performance is
from the new comer, Renee Zellweger as Dorthy Boyd. Her Dorthy is one that
pulled me into the film. Dorthy is a 26-year-old single mother, who has
"had three lovers in the last four years. All coming in second to a warm
bath and a good book." If anything watch Jerry Maguire for Zellweger.
Other performances that stick out are Regina King as Rod Tidwell's loving
wife and Bonnie Hunt as Dorthy's overprotective sister. Also worth
mentioning is Jonathan Lipnicki as Dorthy's (sometimes too) cute son, Ray.
The only complaint that I have is that Zellweger is not one screen as much
as she should been.
Bruce Springsteen has a beautifully serene song, Secret Garden, the plays
twice during the film.
Jerry Maguire is a film that proves that not all films coming out of
Hollywood are completely mindless. Jerry Maguire is a smart funny romantic
comedy. It is populated by character's that are not flat, but well rounded
and make you truly care for them. Jerry Maguire is the perfect film to see
with your significant other.

Title
Review for Soldier (1998)
In the spirit of David Webb Peoples's economy of words with Kurt Russell's
part in Soldier, I'm going to write this review with less sentences than
lines Russell had in Soldier. I'm attempting to write this review in less
than 24 sentences.
Russell is Todd, a soldier raised from birth to kill and only kill. When
Todd is deemed obsolete, he is dump onto a forsaken garbage planet and left
to rot. Todd discovers a group of outcasts on the planet and begins to
regain his humanity. Todd's replacement soldiers come to the planet and try
to kill everyone, but Todd saves the people.
Let's just get the formalities out of the way: Soldier is one of the worst
movies of 1998, ranking right up there with The Avengers and Knock Off.
Russell, who is supposed to be a trained killer, takes his part a little to
seriously. His mute and bland performance  if it can even be called that 
is one of the sore thumbs of this movie. The lines given to Russell by
screenwriter Peoples consist mostly of "Sir!" or some other one-word
phrase. When he's not talking, he's standing around looking like a dolt or
shooting a gun killing people. Not an intensive part for the money that he
was paid.
Soldier's other sore thumb is director Paul (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon)
Anderson. Anderson should go back to directing music videos; he hasn't made
the transition to features films as well as some other music video to
feature film directors. Anderson is not in the same league as David (Alien
3, Se7en, The Game) Fincher, Michael (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon) Bay,
or Alex (The Crow, Dark City) Proyas.
Soldier is a big ball of testosterone that has no story, no performances,
and no real entertainment value. Of course, I could be wrong because the
two guys sitting in front of me during the showing often threw up there
hands during a killing and yelled things like "Yeeeah!" or "Alriiight!" or
just grunted loudly.
The script by David Webb Peoples's is thin, which is a shame since
Peoples's is the co-writer of sci-fi classic Blade Runner.
Women will fear this movie, especially if they're going to be dragged to it
on a date. Testosterone-laced and numb in the brain, Soldier is a bad
movie. Skip Soldier and save yourself 90 minutes plus admission.

Review for Everest (1998)
Ever since I finished reading the book "Into Thin Air", I've wanted to see
the IMAX film Everest. In the latter parts of "Into Thin Air" the IMAX team
is talked about at length  the IMAX team was one of the factors in helping
to save many lives in the tragic and ill-fated ascent to the top of Everest.
Somehow I ended up waiting almost three months before seeing Everest  I'm
sad that I didn't see this film earlier! For those of you who are not
familiar with IMAX films, I'll give a brief description of an IMAX film.
When you see a movie, it is usually printed on 35mm film, which is measure
diagonally from the top left to the bottom right of a single frame. If
you're special, you'll have a 70mm capable theatre around you that can play
films printed on 70mm film  resulting in four times the resolution on the
film. IMAX film is about twice the size of 70mm  quadrupling the
resolution of the image of a 70mm film. So, as you can imagine, the image
on an IMAX film is about as perfect as can be because it has 16 times as
much resolution of the standard films you see.
All this higher resolution stuff doesn't matter if your screen is the size
of your home TV though. So, IMAX theatres are equipped with tremendous
sized screens. For me there are two IMAX screens near me. One at an
amusement park, Great America, and the other is at The Tech Museum in
downtown San Jose. The Great America theatre is mediocre at best, wowing
the audience with a large screen and some decent sound. But the theatre is
old and not well kept. Everest was not showing at the Great America
theatre, but luckily it was showing at The Tech. Everest was the first film
I've ever seen at the Hackworth IMAX Dome Theatre and I am more than
impressed  the theatre left me with my jaw on the floor. This theatre is
built to impress and it is evident from the beginning with its introduction.
But, back to the film. Everest is a documentary and it is a well-written
documentary following a team of people lead by David Breashears. Also on
the team are Ed Viesturs, who not only summitted twice, but did it both
without extra oxygen; Ed's new wife, Paula; Jamling Tenzing Norgay (son of
the guide to the first person to ever summit Everest); and Araceli Segarra
an experience climber from Spain.
The film Everest and director Breashears take advantages of IMAX to the
max. Because an IMAX film is projected onto a screen so large that it
stretches from one end of your field of vision to the other there are a lot
of things that a smart director can do with the film. Breashears amazes us
with helicopter flights, climbing shots with the camera mounted looking
down, crossings of ice glacier canyons with the camera pointed into the
dark endless hole below, and many other things that would and can make a
viewer sick to the stomach but also amaze them to the point of verbal
"oohs" and "ahs".
If you haven't ever seen an IMAX film, or if you've seen one of the more
mediocre ones, Don't Miss Everest at your local IMAX theatre. This film is
a treat for the senses.

Review for Crimson Tide (1995)
Looking at some of Tony Scott's movies (Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and The
Last Boy Scout) it is hard to accept that Crimson Tide is a movie of his.
It is even harder to accept that Crimson Tide is a Jerry Bruckheimer and
Don Simpson production. As you look at the visual style of Crimson Tide it
is obvious that this is a Tony Scott movie and it is a Bruckheimer and
Simpson production.
Why do I say that it is hard to accept that Crimson Tide is a Tony Scott
movie? Because Crimson Tide is so intelligent, so character focused, and
the action so tight that it seems anomalous to previous
Scott/Bruckheimer/Simpson productions. In previous Tony Scott movies, such
as Top Gun, the action was wildly over-the-top and the characterization
mere one-dimensional -- enough to keep the movie going and enough to keep
the action coming. But, this anomalous movie, Crimson Tide, from Tony Scott
shows that he can do a movie that is all gloss but filled with characters
that we care for and are truly dimensional and layered.
Gene Hackman is Captain Frank Ramsey, captain of the nuclear submarine
Alabama. His XO, executive officer, is out with appendicitis, and he needs
a new one. Why? Because his boat is about to set sail to take care of some
hostile rebels in Russia who have seized a military base and is threatening
a missile attack on the US. The new XO that Ramsey picks is Lt. Commander
Hunter, played by Denzel Washington. These two men are exact opposites.
Ramsey is a simple man that follows orders without having to know why.
Hunter, a Harvard trained officer, wants to know why before doing
something. This puts the men at odds when trouble arises. And trouble
arises when they are forced to consider firing their nuclear missiles. It
is a broken EAM (Emergency Action Message) transmission that puts these two
men at odds. Should they fire their missiles? Or should they get confirmation?
The script by Michael Schiffer gives the audience many things to think
about when all hell breaks loose on the Alabama. Both Ramsey and Hunter are
correct in what they are doing on the ship -- but in the same sense both of
them are also completely wrong in what they are doing. Ramsey and Hunter
cause a mutiny aboard the Alabama and the crew is split between the two
head men. Both men believe that they are correct and in my eyes I believe
that they are both correct also. So, there lies the dilemma proposed by
Schiffer: Who is right onboard a nuclear missile submarine when there is no
chain of command left? And following this why is the chain of command
important?
Early in Crimson Tide, it boldly mentions other great sub movies as if to
taunt the audience to compare those classics with Crimson Tide. And, if one
were take the challenge up and compare Crimson Tide to the movies mentioned
--The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run Deep -- Crimson Tide would stand
proudly next to them. Instead of putting out a completely mindless action
movie where the two men battle it out with flying bullets and fists,
Crimson Tide is the battle of will between the two men. The film makes the
audience think with the two men, about the consequences of their actions
and who is really right. Though I was more sympathetic and understanding to
Washington's Hunter, Hackman's Ramsey was not all wrong either.
Washington gives a great performance as Hunter. He presents Hunter as a
strong willed man who is not afraid to take a stand -- against even a
superior -- when he believes that he is right. Hackman also does a great
job with Ramsey. Hackman gives a layered performance, putting a happy easy
going exterior to Ramsey, but showing the darker interior from time to
time. It is the performances of these two that carry Crimson Tide. But, the
supporting cast also gives great performances. These include Matt Craven,
Rocky Carroll, Danny Nucci, and Lillo Brancato. The strongest supporting
actor in Crimson Tide would be a toss up between Viggo Mortensen as the one
man that holds the second set of keys to the nuclear missiles and George
Dzundza as the by-the-books Chief of the Boat.
Crimson Tide has a lot of action in it; but surprisingly enough the action
is not the main focus of the film. Rather the focus of the film is of the
two main characters and of the two ideologies that these characters carry
with them. The action is handled well by Scott, but it seems that Scott has
a newfound way of integrating the action with the characters.
By all means, Crimson Tide is one of the most enjoyable films made. It is
well directed, well acted, and well scripted. Tony Scott knows how to build
up emotions throughout the film and does it well. The film will not only
makes you think, it will also entertain you. Crimson Tide is a film that
works on two levels: One while you're in the theatre gasping for breathe
along with the sailors on the screen when they are in danger. And the
second when you leave the theatre it works on a level that makes you gnaw
over what was presented to you. Sure, this doesn't feel like a Tony Scott
film at first, but you'll get used to it. And I hope Tony Scott can put out
more great films like Crimson Tide. Don't Miss Crimson Tide.

Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
Planet of the Apes (2001)
Reviewed by Steve Kong (Reviews@UltraMookie.com)
Copyright (c) 2001 Steve Kong
URL:  http://www.ultramookie.com/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=7
Planet of the Apes is all Tim Burton style. The movie plot is pretty 
simplistic and that is good since this is a summer movie. A pilot Leo (Mark 
Wahlberg) crashes on a plane that is ruled by apes. Humans are second class 
citizens on this planet and are treated like animals. Leo runs into a group 
of humans that he befriends, one of the humans is the beautiful Daena 
(Estella Warren). Helping this group of humans is an ape named Ari (Helena 
Bonham Carter). The plot? Humans fight for their rights on this planet and 
Leo is their saviour that fell from the sky.
Yes, there is one or two plot twists to this story and a ending that 
surprised me (thought was unsatisfying), but they story is pretty thin. So 
what is there to watch in this movie?
Simply said, The Apes. The apes in the movie upstage the humans! Tim Roth 
as the vile General Thade, Michael Clarke Duncan as Attar, and Carter as 
Ari all turn in wonderful perfomances from under all that make up. The same 
can't be said about the humans. Wahlberg is a very limited actor and it 
shows here. Watch just what little reaction he has when he encounters 
talking apes. And Warren is just there as eye candy, her part is so thin 
that if she disappeared halfway through the film I doubt anyone would miss 
it. The apes though are great! Not just because of the revolutionary make 
up that they have that lets they truly emote, but because the actors that 
play the apes are top-notch. Roth's performance is only a one note 
performance, but he plays that note well. And Carter as Ari adds some 
warmth to any otherwise bland character.
Rick Baker (Men in Black) has to be given many kudos for the work he's done 
for this movie. The ape make up is perfect. The score by Danny Elfman is 
perfection also. Every detail in this film is done to perfection and that's 
what should be watched for. It's too bad that all the perfect pieces don't 
fit together all that well. And although I enjoyed the movie and liked how 
Burton threw in the surprise ending, the movie in the end is just a 
mediocre movie -- something that's to be expected from a summer movie, but 
I expected a whole lot more out of Burton. 

Title
Review for Mimic (1997)
Mimic has a title that describes what it does. Mimic imitates and copies
other movies. But, like the predators portrayed in Mimic, Mimic is a bad
copy of other movies.
Mimic stars Mira Sorvino as an entomologist who creates a cure for a deadly
disease that infects children.  Because the disease is spread via
cockroaches, Sorvino's character Susan creates, via genetic engineering, an
insect, Judas Breed, that kills the roaches.  These genetically engineered
insects have a six-month life span and are sterile.  This interesting story
is just the back-story of Mimic.  It has so much potential.  But, Mimic
picks up only after the explanation of the back-story.  Like the dinosaurs
from Jurassic Park, nature takes its way with the insects of Mimic and they
breed into a whole colony.  And it is here where the movie picks up, the
human battle for survival against these insects.
So, you may ask, where does the movie get its title?  The insects have
mutated to resemble their predators, and they mimic us, the humans.  The
insects are quite interesting actually, the movie producers chose not to
use the easy way to have the insects mimic us.  This easy way would be by
giving the insects the ability to morph into humans.  Instead the producers
chose to have the insects "wrap" themselves tight with their wings to form
a humanlike shape.
Mimic does not really work as a horror film because it is hardly scary.
But, there are times where the director, Guillermo Del Toro, builds some
heavy tension.  But, this tension is lost because the payoff for the
tension just does not get where it should.  Del Toro does have the eye for
mood though, he does a good job at setting a dark mood for the film, and
continuing it throughout the film.
Academy Award winner Sorvino shows some limitations as an actress in Mimic,
her two real feelings shown in the film are scared and angry.  The other
Academy Award winner F. Murray Abraham has a small role in Mimic and does
not get too much screen time.  The real star of Mimic is the highly
likeable, and entertaining Charles Dutton as the cop Leonard.
The one thing that comes early on in Mimic that makes it almost apparent
that it is trying to imitate and copy from other films is the credits.  The
opening credits are presented in the flashy, carved fashion that are
reminiscent of the credits of Se7en.
Mimic is a B-grade movie with A-list actors.  It is a horror film, and
although it does better than this summers other horror film, Event Horizon,
it does not reach any new heights.  Like Event Horizon, there was so much
potential for Mimic, but it was all lost.

Title
Review for Practical Magic (1998)
It's hard not to like Practical Magic. It has a talented cast, wonderful
music, and beautiful cinematography. The one thing that Practical Magic
doesn't have is a cohesive script to make all the good elements stick
together.
Practical Magic is like a witch's brew. To conjure up this brew, throw in
one part drama, one part whodunnit, two parts romance, and a sprinkle of
supernatural. This is the largest failure of Practical Magic. Once the
movie settles into a comfortable genre it jumps out and goes into another.
This is jarring for the audience and never gives the audience anything to
hang on to.
Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian (Nicole Kidman) Owens are sisters. They
are from a long line of witches. The curse of the Owens women is that each
man they fall in love with will eventually die before his time. Sally and
Gillian are outcasts in their small town because their witch aunts (Dianne
Wiest and Stockard Channing) raised them both as witches.
There are a few subplots in Practical Magic. One talks about Sally's
children and husband. Another talks about a murder and an investigation
headed by an outsider, Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn). Then there is a story of
a lost soul, one of a romance between a sister and Hallet, and finally one
about the town's rejection of the Owens family. With all these subplots,
the story is quite unfocused. Though, it didn't have to be if the script
were smarter and the director sharper.
Aidan Quinn's was the one good performance that stood out. His lonely but
strong cop is the best of the characters in Practical Magic. His
performance is also the best. His character gets stuck in a sticky
situation when he falls in love with a witch that is probably a murderer. 
Sandra Bullock does nothing new with her part. She continues to try to
regain what popularity she lost with her flop, Speed 2. Bullock brings back
her girl-next-door act making Practical Magic feel somewhat like a witch's
version of Hope Floats.
Nicole Kidman is good as the bad sister. Kidman just looks different in
Practical Magic. Her performance is slinky and snake-like. It was a pure
joy to watch Kidman onscreen.
The script by Robin Swicord and Akiva (Lost in Space and Batman and Robin)
Goldsman and Adam Brooks is an absolute mess. The script is based on Alice
Hoffman's book by the same name. Practical Magic just drips of Goldsman's
bad writing. In most cases, books are better than the movies made from
them. And in most cases screenwriters are smart enough to cut out some
subplots from books because of time restraints. Swicord, Goldsman, and
Brooks are not this smart. It feels as if they tried to squeeze every
subplot from the book into a two-hour script.
Practical Magic is nothing magical. Nor is it anything new. There is no
real target audience for Practical Magic because it drifts from one genre
to another. But it is somewhat entertaining. If you really want to see
Practical Magic, wait until it comes out on video.

Review for Charlie's Angels (2000)
I don't remember watching the TV series Charlie's Angels, given that the 
show premiered when I was about a year old, I guess that's why.  Now, 
Charlie's Angels is a big screen movie starring big name stars that I 
recognize.  How's the movie?
Remember this summer's Mission: Impossible 2?  Great film, but it lacked a 
sort of fun to it.  I loved M:I-2 since John Woo directed it, but the movie 
did take itself a little too seriously.  Imagine Charlie's Angels as M:I-2 
with the seriousness taken out and a lot of fun added in.
Three angels, absolutely gorgeous angels might I add, work for a man 
they've never seen, his name is Charlie.  These angels, Natalie (Cameron 
Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu), are trained to do 
everything.  Charlie guides them along via a proxy, Bosley (Bill 
Murray).  The opening sequence of the film sets the tone for the rest of 
the film, it takes place on an airliner and it is explosive.
The plot for Charlie's Angels is quite thin, something to do about a 
kidnapping, a satellite, voice recognition, and plain old revenge.  But, 
that doesn't matter because the film is more about mindless fun and action, 
oh and lots of cleavage.  And it delivers on all counts of this.  Complete 
with mind-bending computer enhanced and ever so fake looking martial arts, 
explosions, car chases, helicopters, and did I mention explosions, 
Charlie's Angels is a summer film trapped in a fall release date.
There's not much I can say about the film.  It's mindless and it's 
fun.  The actresses are great in their roles and all of them savor 
it.  Diaz steals every scene she's in.  Barrymore is wonderful.  And Liu is 
great.  Murray does some great scenes in the movie in which he improvises 
and these scenes are laugh out loud funny.
The director, Joseph McGinty Nichol (credited on the film as McG), knows 
how to put together a wham-bang film.  He uses slow motion well, as if he's 
studied John Woo's film with great care.  He puts together action sequences 
that will satisfy any adrenaline junky.    Kudos to McG for putting 
together such a fun movie.
Well, like I said before, there is not much I can say about this film but 
Don't Miss it.  This is a Don't Miss film, catch it in the theatres.  It's 
nice to have a post-summer adrenaline rush type film like this in late fall.

Review for 2 Days in the Valley (1996)
2 Days, 1 Murder, and 10 people.  How does this all tie together?  A skier, 
a hitman, a tramp named Helga, two vice detectives, a suicidal movie 
director, a nurse, an art dealer with a stone, and others.  2 Days in the 
Valley is a movie that takes these lives and threads them together into one 
cohesive and highly entertaining film.
The problem with bringing this many characters and individual stories to a 
movie is the fact that some audience members will get lost after the first 
few are introduced.  Writer/Director John Herzfeld does a good job of 
inter-cutting between the stories and making everyone known.  Some of the 
stories are not tied up well, like the story of Jeff Daniel's dejected cop, 
but most of them do end up well.  Also, there are some nagging points that 
are brought up and never really cleared up  the biggest being the Korean 
thing, which confused me.
The one thing that 2 Days in the Valley reminded me of was a Tarantino film 
because its structure is so complex, the events that happen so different, 
that it feels like watching Pulp Fiction on drugs.  2 Days in the Valley is 
more interested in the characters than it is in the crimes that bring the 
characters together.  We see little pieces of each character, some of these 
events are out of the blue, some are explained, but all are part of the 
puzzle that is put together at the end of the movie.
To try to explain the story and what happens is going to spoil the 
film.  The movie does evolve around a murder.  Around this murder events 
start to happen and they all tie together.  The characters include a washed 
out hitman named Dosmo (Danny Aiello); the ex-wife of the murder man, Becky 
(Teri Hatcher) who is obsessed with winning gold in the skiing events at 
the Olympics; a scheming couple, the maniacal Lee (James Spader) and the 
sex-kitten Helga (Charlize Theron in her debut film); a suicidal movie 
director who hangs his toilet paper on a long won Emmy, Teddy (Paul 
Mazursky); a nurse that in a cemetery, Audrey (Marsha Mason); two cops, one 
who is gung-ho for his job (Eric Stoltz) and one who is not (Jeff Daniels); 
an arrogant art dealer who has kidney stones (Greg Cruttwell) and his 
hapless assistant (Gleane Headly); and a few others.  If you had a hard 
time keeping track of the people here in the review, don't worry, it's all 
clear in the movie.
Kudos to writer/director John Herzfeld for putting together such an 
entertaining movie.  It has its small flaws, but those are easily 
overlooked.  I would like to find out just how Herzfeld put this story 
together.  If he started from the end and then plotted towards the 
beginning or if it just all happened to fall together one day as he was 
looking out the window.  The story and characters are magnificent.  Don't 
Miss 2 Days in the Valley.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
I admire Michael Bay for his second major film, The Rock. His first film,
Bad Boys, was OK, but nothing spectacular. Armageddon marks the third time
Michael Bay has taken to directing a major motion picture. The thing to
remember about Bay is that he is one of the few directors that have
successfully taken the leap from directing music videos to directing
feature films.
Armageddon is a standard fare action/sci-fi movie. It is also the second
half of this year's objects-from-outer-space movies, the first being Deep
Impact. To get the question out of the way, I though Armageddon was better
than Deep Impact. Armageddon was easier to sit through than Deep Impact,
there was more action and fewer tries at characterizations,
characterizations that just didn't seem to work for either film.
During a routine day in New York a sudden roar is heard. From the sky comes
flaming objects the size of tennis balls and Volkswagens. These small
meteors are just an early warning for the impending impact of an asteroid
the size of Texas. Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thorton) of NASA is heading up a
project to stop the asteroid from wiping out humanity. Truman's first and
last option is to send up a crew of men to drill into the asteroid and
plant a nuclear bomb to blow the asteroid into two pieces.
The men chosen are the world's best deep core drilling team. They are lead
by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an angry and rough-around-the-edges man.
One of the subplots is about crew member A.J. Frost's (Ben Affleck)
relationship with Stamper's daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler). This creates some
superficial and sometimes lagging conflict between Stamper and Frost.
Armageddon is unlike Bay and Bruckheimer's last teaming, The Rock. The Rock
was a mindless summer film, but had better characters that the audience
could identify with. I found it hard to identify with the three main
characters of Armageddon. Willis's Stamper starts off on the wrong foot and
never really gets back onto the right one until near the end of the film.
Affleck's Frost is too wild and unbelievable to latch onto, though I did
find myself hoping that his character wouldn't perish.
Thorton's Truman was a bit more likeable and I did identify with him a lot
more than Stamper and Frost. In comparison, The Rock had three strong
likeable characters all being portrayed by good actors (Nicolas Cage, Sean
Connery, and Ed Harris).
I was saddened to see that Liv Tyler was pushed back to the
crying-woman-waiting-for-her-men-to-come-home role. Other supporting actors
are not given much to do either. Steve Buscemi, Will Patton, William
Fitchner, and a few others are all wasted. Buscemi does get a few funny
lines and Patton gets to act like a tough guy but it's not enough. 
As for acting, there are quite a few surprises. First off, Bruce Willis
gives one of his best performances in recent memory. He is quite believable
and doesn't have to fall back on his John McClain character. I loved
Willis's performance in Armageddon. If anything, see Armageddon for Willis.
Affleck, who performed well in Good Will Hunting, doesn't do too hot in
Armageddon. His cocky young I'm-always-right act wears thing after a while.
Billy Bob Thorton does an admirable job with his part.
As for Bay, he's not improved much since The Rock. In my review of The Rock
I talked about Bay's obsession with the Shaky-Camera Technique that he
brought over from his music video days. I thought that after a few years,
he'd learn a bit more about the differences between music videos and
feature films. He has, but he has not learned enough. Armageddon uses a
heavy dose of the Shakey-Camera Technique to try to get and keep our
attention. My note for Bay Michael, you have our attention. Stop shaking
the camera and putting in flashy camera angles! Just tell us a good story.
Armageddon runs a bit long, clocking in at two and half-hours. With this
sort of time allotment, there shouldn't be too many loose ends, but there
are. And they are quite noticable. One includes a scene where a few of the
drillers are arrested after a brawl, and straight after that they are
readying for take-off. What happened in jail? How'd they get out of jail?
An early meteor shower tears up New York City, but as quickly as the meteor
shower ends, all news of the event disappear. No one questions what
happened in New York City. Some of the time is also spent telling a hokey
love story the one between Frost and Grace which includes a cheezy scene
using animal crackers.
Don't see Armageddon for real physics. There are loud explosions in space,
there is selective gravity on the asteroid, and there are other physics
anomalies throughout the film. 
I really loved parts of Armageddon. The opening destruction was
spectacular, with meteors punching holes through skyscrapers as if they
were made of Popsicle sticks. The training portion of the film gives a good
look at what astronauts get to do during training. The pool scenes were
amazing.
And the launch of the two shuttles was exciting. With all these complaints
though, I still had a hell of a time. Armageddon might be a dumb movie, but
it's also a movie that works well being superficial. If you don't expect
too much from Armageddon, you'll walk out of the movie theatre happy. I
liked Armageddon and I recommend it.
There are flaws, some significant, but they can be overlooked. Strangely
enough, as hokey as some of the scenes are, I found myself somewhat teary-
eyed at the end of the movie. If you want to see true space heros, rent
Apollo 13. If you want to see real action, rent The Rock. If you want to
see real sci-fi, rent Contact. If you have two hours to burn and want to
see a fun movie in an air-conditioned theatre during matinee, catch
Armageddon.

Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
I'll admit up front that I've only become a big fan of the James Bond films 
after I saw GoldenEye.  I've seen one or two Sean Connery Bond films, one 
Moore, and all of the Dalton ones.  Strangely, it was Dalton's Bond that 
truly introduced me to the Bond franchise.  But, it was Brosnan's Bond that 
got me hooked.  Dalton's Bond was, well, terrible.  Brosnan is the better 
Bond.  And to stir some controversy, I think that Brosnan is a better Bond 
than Connery, I think that Brosnan is the best Bond of all.
So, it is to no surprise that I loved The World is Not Enough.  It's a 
Don't Miss film, packed with action, intrigue, and well, everything that 
we've come to expect from a Bond film:  "Bond, James Bond", "Shaken, not 
stirred", M, Q, beautiful women with funny names, and heaps of sexual 
innuendo.  Brosnan's Bond films have revitalized the Bond franchise.   With 
each film getting better, The World is Not Enough is the best of the three 
Brosnan Bond films.
The storyline is convoluted and in the tradition of Bond storylines, it 
needs a lot of suspension of disbelief.  I must say though, the story was a 
little more fleshed out than other Bond films, especially the 
characterizations.  More on that later.  An oil tycoon is killed and Bond 
is asked by M (Judi Dench) to protect his daughter, Electra King (Sophie 
Marceau), because she may well be the next victim.  The terrorist that 
killed Electra's father is a man named Renard (Robert Carlyle), who lives 
after having a bullet lodged into his brain by another MI6 agent.  The 
bullet is killing Renard slowly, but with everyday it is lodged in his 
brain, he becomes stronger - don't see Bond films for medical class.  It 
seems that Renard has bigger plans than just killing Electra.  Somehow, in 
this entire story a physicist, Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards), gets 
sucked into being Bond's sidekick.  (Yes, I know what you're saying, 
"Denise Richards?  A physicist?"  Yes, it's true.)  So, Bond must save the 
world from Renard and someone else, which you'll find out in the film, but 
it's not too hard to figure out.  There are other little sub-plots in the 
film and they are, though light in treatment, well written.  There is also 
an introduction of a new character to the franchise, R (John Cleese), which 
seems to be Q's (Desmond Llelewyn) replacement.
If you've seen the last two Brosnan Bond outings and liked them, you'll 
absolutely love The World is Not Enough.  There are enough explosions, 
gunfire, and chases to make your heart glow.  The film opens, like all Bond 
films, with a well-executed action sequence.  The one in The World is Not 
Enough is an extended sequence that starts in an office goes to boats in 
the Thames and ends in a hot air balloon.  Quite a rousing start to the 
film with the action gets better from there.
Brosnan is cast perfectly as Bond.  He has just enough of a sly boyish 
charm to fill the shoes of Bond.  Yet he has a detached front to all of 
it.  This time around, Brosnan has gotten the role down pat, maybe gotten 
it down just a little too well.  At times Brosnan seems to be bored with 
the role and looks as if he's just going through the motions.  At other 
times though, Brosnan seems to be going all out with the role - look at the 
scene with Brosnan and the sunglasses in the casino.  He's mixed in this 
outing, but he's still the best Bond in my mind.
Carlyle is cast as the villain in this film, but he is only half the 
badness of the film.  And, well, he's not the memorable half of the 
badness.  Known mostly, in America at least, for his part in The Full 
Monty, Carlyle's part feels padded.  His part is wholly forgettable and 
underwritten.  He also doesn't have enough menace in him to be scary on 
screen, at least not enough to be a good villain.  Carlyle does what he can 
with his role.
Marceau is the standout performer of the film.  She gives such depth to her 
Bond-girl role that the role can't even be called so.  She is classy in the 
role, giving it a full and rich performance that will be remembered for a 
while - and that is saying a lot since, as you may remember, this is a Bond 
film!  Kudos to Marceau for putting such great effort into her character.
And, well, finally there's Denise Richards.  She can't act worth a lick and 
I think the only reason she's in the film is so that she can run around in 
tight t-shirts, tight shorts, and tight pants - getting the box-office grab 
from the male audience.  Oh, and not to forget, she also gets a scene in a 
wet white t-shirt.  Yes, Richards is the true Bond-girl of The World is Not 
Enough.  She fills the role OK.  She really can't act, but she does seem to 
be putting in a good effort and it looks like she's having fun with the 
role.  Her role is fairly thin and her lines are even worse.  But, I guess 
she's there for eye candy and she works well as so.
The film is directed by Michael Apted, who is better known for his 
documentaries (7 Up series) and non-action films (Nell).  Apted does just 
fine as the director of this film.  Putting together some finely crafted 
action sequences that get the adrenaline pumping.  I loved the opening 
sequence, the skiing sequence, and the caviar sequence.  They are all well 
done.  Apted is a notch better at action direction than Tomorrow Never Dies 
director Roger Spottiswoode.  The cinematographer, Adrian Biddle (Aliens, 
Thema and Louise), works well with Apted and the film is strikingly 
beautiful.  Maybe for Bond 20 the producers can sign John Woo into for the 
director's chair and see how much better the action can be.  The three 
Brosnan Bond films have been directed by directors not really known for 
directing action (Martin Campbell, Roger Spottiswoode, and Michael 
Apted).  I'd love to see what kind of Bond film would come out of it being 
directed by a director strictly known for his action work.
What needs to be noticed in this film is the score by David Arnold 
(Stargate, Independence Day, Tomorrow Never Dies).  Eric Serra scored the 
first Brosnan Bond film, GoldenEye.  Serra took the stance that John 
Barry's Bond theme was old, worn out, and, well, wouldn't work for the new 
Bond films.  Serra's generic score for GoldenEye didn't do the film 
justice.  Serra dead wrong about Barry's Bond theme.  Arnold proved Serra 
wrong with his score to Tomorrow Never Dies, weaving Barry's Bond theme 
into an original score, making the score reminiscent of Bond without 
copying Barry outright.  Arnold's score for Tomorrow Never Dies took me 
aback.  The day before the release of The World is Not Enough, I bought 
Arnold's score for the film.  Arnold has outdone his Tomorrow Never Dies 
score with his The World is Not Enough score.  This score is wholly 
original, yet it draws enough from Barry's Bond theme that it seems quite 
familiar.  The Bond feeling is back in the score and it works really well 
with the film.  Kudos to Arnold for putting together a wonderful score.
Bottom line?  Don't Miss The World is Not Enough.  This is the best Bond 
film to date.

Review for She's So Lovely (1997)
In no way is she so lovely, both in physical looks and personality. Sean
Penn and wife Robin Wright Penn star in this Nick Cassavetes' film written
by his late father John Cassavetes.
She So Lovely is a love story by some means, but it's more of a character
study of two characters, Sean Penn's Eddie and Robin Wright Penn's Maureen.
Eddie and Maureen are married, and Eddie is often a very jealous man, who
has violent outbreaks. Maureen is raped early on in the film and when Eddie
finds outs, we know what's going to happen. So does Maureen, she calls the
authorities on Eddie, and he is caught. Eddie is put into an institution
and Maureen moves on in life.
John Travolta's name is featured prominently when this film is advertised,
and that was one of the reasons that I went to see the film. Unfortunately,
Travolta shows up very late in the film, and spends only thirty or so
minutes on screen. Compounding this, Travolta really had nothing to do but
drink, smoke, and being angry.
Nick Cassavetes, whom you saw as the bald gangster in this summer's
Face/Off, takes the reigns, and directs his late father's script. Nick does
a good job of keeping the film moving along, but the script is somewhat
weak. The last half seems tacked on and adlibbed. 
Sean Penn is the biggest reason to see She's So Lovely. He does a great job
with his role going through the many stages of his character, from caring
and loving to angry and violent to sedated and free going.
The "she" that is referred to in the title is Maureen. Robin Wright does a
good job with her character also, inserting all sorts of ticks and gestures
to the character. Her character is filmed the opposite of lovely, often
filmed to look pare, skinny, and plain. Lovely she's not. And as you get to
know Maureen more, she's not beautiful inside, often drinking too much,
smoking too much, and leaving responsibilities. 
She's So Lovely is definitely not a date movie, it is often depressing. And
though there is definitely love between Eddie and Maureen, we get to know
them well, and in the end it doesn't matter if they are in love or not, we
just don't like them. She's So Lovely is not a film that I can say that I
can recommend. But, it is also not a film that I can say to pass up. Catch
this one on video when it comes out.

Review for Conspiracy Theory (1997)
I've fallen in love again with Julia Roberts. It's been a while since I've
seen a movie with her in it but I'm glad to see her again. Conspiracy
Theory is a movie that doesn't go far enough on anything. It doesn't have
enough action to be an action film, it doesn't have enough thrills to be a
thriller, and it doesn't have enough laughs to be a comedy. But, it does
have Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, and at the helm of the production
Richard Donner.
Gibson's last outing with Donner was the failed Maverick. This time around
though, the film is enough to draw a crowd and the story enough to hold our
attention.
Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson) is a paranoid man who thinks that there is a
conspiracy behind everything. People are trying to kill the President with
a major earthquake caused by the Space Shuttle. Fluorine in our water is
there not only to keep our teeth white, but also to help loosen us up and
make us easily controlled by the government. And the best one yet, Oliver
Stone is just a misinformation guy helping to cover up government
conspiracies. Jerry is also a little strange and has flashbacks while
driving his cab. He has a deep infatuation with Alice Sutton (Julia
Roberts) who is a lawyer for the Justice Department. Jerry's apartment is
lined with aluminum foil, his door is quadrupled locked, his refrigerator
is locked, and even his cans have locks. And in his free time Jerry likes
to write a newsletter named Conspiracy Theory. It's subscriber base? Five.
Now that Jerry has published another issue, it seems that someone is out to
get him. There must have been a theory in there that struck a nerve,
something that is true.
Julia Roberts gives a good performance, as Jerry's love interest. I loved
Mel Gibson's performance, but it is Roberts who steals the show with her
smile. Gibson's performance is almost on par with his performance in the
Lethal Weapon series (which he also did with Richard Donner.) His character
is nuts and sometimes very unpredictable. But Jerry is a loveable guy also.
Patrick Steward plays the suspicious good and bad Doctor Jonas. Steward
gives as good as a performance he can with the material that he is given.
And he actually does make for a good protagonist. Donner, who is not really
a very visual director, does a nice job with this film. The buildings look
ominous, the rain even worse, and the bad guys all faceless. The movie does
run a little long, but it is bearable.
I recommend Conspiracy Theory for all of those who are interested in a,
though uninspired, action romantic comedy thriller. It's hard to get all of
those genres into one film, and Conspiracy Theory shows that it is. But,
Conspiracy Theory does not fall under the weight of it all. When there is
action, it is well staged. When it needs to thrill it certainly does. When
it wants to make us laugh, it does it. And when there is an emotional
moment, it makes us choke up.

Title
Review for Sneakers (1992)
Sneakers is a light-hearted techno-thriller that entertains.
Sneakers is about a rag-tag team of industrial espionage experts. By
themselves, they would be individual nobodies. As a team, they are a group
that big corporations hire to break into their facilities to find faults in
the security systems. Leading the team is a 60's activist, Bishop (Robert
Redford). Also on the team are Mother (Dan Aykroyd), a paranoid man who has
more conspiracy theories than Fox Mulder (of The X-Files); former CIA man
Crease (Sidney Poitier); a young hacker Carl (River Phoenix); and a blind
guy, Whistler (David Strathairn).
Two NSA (National Security Agency) agents approach the team to recover a
black box. It seems that the black box contains circuitry that is the
ultimate code-breaker. This black box could for instance take a scrambled
data transfer from the Air Traffic Control system and decode it for anyone
to see or manipulate. Want to crash a plane? Quite a dangerous weapon if it
fell into the wrong hands.
As big as a computer geek as I am, watching movies that use computers in
them is more often than not a painful experience. Hollywood never gets
computer stuff correct on the screen and Hollywood is the worst when it
pushes the computer technology as the basis for a movie I can't remember
how hard I laughed when I watched Sandra Bullock in The Net. Things are
different with Sneakers, though. Computer technology is the basis for the
movie, but director Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams), surprisingly,
keeps the computer stuff to a minimum. This works very well for Sneakers.
Computers, though the basis for the story, aren't really put to the
forefront when it comes to screen time. Most of the computers used in
Sneakers are just boxes with big glowing screens.
The script for Sneakers, written by Lawrence Lasker and Phil Alden
Robinson, is smart and tries to be smarter than it really is. The "bad guy"
in the movie can be easily guessed after the first few minutes of the film.
But, because the film doesn't take itself too seriously, the script works
out well.
Robert Redford is fits perfectly into the role of Bishop, the guy who gets
in over his head. The rest of the team doesn't get enough to do to be
memorable. Though Aykroyd is memorable in any film, his appearance in
Sneakers feels odd. Aykroyd's Mother is hilarious when he starts to talk to
Poitier's Crease. There is another performer in the film that is oily and
slimy and fits into the role very well. If I give away the identity of the
character or the name of the actor that portrays him I'd spoil the film.
Let's just say the character has a room filled with body heat and motion
detectors.
The only big complaint I have with Sneakers is that it runs just a tad too
long, clocking in at six minutes over two hours. Other small things felt
out of place with the film. For instance, the homeless guy outside of the
NSA office just didn't feel right. The overly nerdy "my voice is my
passport" guy from the toy company felt way out of place. Some of the
computer stuff looked strange, though this is just a matter of the
equipment being outdated.
You can find Sneakers on video and DVD and I'd recommend the film. Sneakers
has the 'fun factor' that most other films based on computers are lacking.
Sneakers also doesn't take the computer stuff too seriously. If you want a
film that will thrill, check out Sneakers.

Title
Review for Dark City (1998)
Some movies create two different worlds: one for the trailer and one for
the actual movie.  The trailer for Dark City was mysterious.  It induced a
feeling of awe for what the movie is about.  The visuals, the loud audio,
and the mysterious text all worked together to create this feeling of awe.
Does the movie live up to the trailer?  And does Dark City carry through
with the incredible world that we glimpsed in the trailer?
Alex Proyas is best known for the dark world and mood that he created for
Brandon Lee's last film, The Crow.  But, his work was overshadowed by the
tragic death of Lee.  This time with Dark City, Proyas is let loose to work
and create a world that truly lives up to its name.  Dark City is a
luscious looking film-and even that is an understatement.  The world that
Proyas puts up on the screen is a strange mix of Ridley Scott's Blade
Runner and Tim Burton's Batman world.  Though not set in a technological
wonder like Blade Runner the world does overshadow Batman's world.  I think
that this is what Burton was aiming for with his original Batman but was
unable to create it.
The movie is not all visuals, though.  It opens with a dreary monologue by
a Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) which explains about "The Strangers."
It seems that The Strangers are a group of aliens who have taken beings
from a world-though never specified as the Earth-and offloaded them onto
the Strangers' world.  Here on the Strangers' world the humans become
specimens for the Strangers' experiments.  The Strangers are a slowly dying
race and that are looking to beat their mortality and they think that they
can find it in the human soul.  We then are introduced to the main
character of the film, John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell), who wakes up in a motel
room with a dead prostitute next to his bed.  Murdoch looks around the room
for clues to what happened and finds a few things.
Murdoch,though, has had a complete loss of memory and is unsure if he is a
killer or not.  Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt) is assigned to the case
and is on the trailer of Murdoch.  Murdoch tries to find out who he really
is and follows a trail of clues which leads him to many things, including
his wife, Emma (Jennifer Connelly).  We question if Murdoch is really the
killer as we discover more about how Dark City really operates.
It seems that in the Dark City there is no day time; it's a continuous
night, and for a good reason.
The script for Dark City comes from a story by Proyas and is written by
Proyas, Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer.  It introduces a lot of interesting
ideas for the audience to think about.  Dark City questions one's real
identity and one's reality.  Who are we really?  What makes us who we are?
Is this all real?  The problem with the script is that it tries overly hard
to explain every idea introduced and leaves nothing for the audience to
think about.  Every time something mysterious, awe inspiring, or
interesting is introduced a character stops everything and gives a long
monologue explaining what it is about.  The characters are too talky.  I'm
a big X-Files fan and for a good reason, the writers for The X-Files know
that not everything needs to be explained, that some things are best left
to the audience's imagination and left for the audience to chew over.  It
is this ambiguity of The X-Files that makes it so enjoyable.  Had Proyas,
Dobbs, and Goyer watched a few more episodes of The X-Files they would have
learned the same.  Proyas, Dobbs, and Goyer leave nothing to the audience's
imagination- everything is clearly explained and nothing is left in the dark.
Dark City's visuals are stunning.  The city that these characters live in
is incredible with its tall skyline, the dark ominous buildings, the retro
look of everything, and the clear lack of lighting.  It creates an
atmosphere for the movie that comes very close to overshadowing the story
itself.  The one thing, and this could be seen as a bad thing, that subdues
the overly large presence of the city is Proyas' editing.  Proyas edits the
film like a music video or a movie trailer.  Everything comes in quick
flashes and there are little or no steady shots for us to really see how
characters are reacting.  Also there are no shots that let us fully take in
the city and atmosphere that Proyas created for the movie.  The editing of
the film feels like a comic book-flashing from one panel to the next, not
taking anytime to slow down and let the audience look at the visuals.
The performances by the cast are all about equal.  They come close to being
a bit too bland, though they never slip into that territory.  Rufus Sewell,
who you can also catch in the current Dangerous Beauty, fares a little
better than the rest of the cast.
Dark City is one of those films that draws you in even though it has some
outstanding flaws.  I enjoyed Dark City and all the ideas that it
generates, but I enjoyed the visuals the most.  Dark City is not a "style
over substance" film.  Actually, it can be argued that Dark City has a
little more substance than it really needs.  I recommend the film, though
it doesn't create enough to warrant a Don't Miss nod.

Title
Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
With a name like A Perfect Murder, a movie has a lot to live up to. Is A
Perfect Murder perfect?
Stephen Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a big money mover who is married to
Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow), the daughter of a rich family. Emily is having an
affair with a grimy looking painter, David (Viggo Mortenson). 
The questions posed by the script are: Does Emily's husband know about the
affair? What would he do if he found out? How long can the affair last? And
is it really love that David is searching for?
If you have seen the previews for A Perfect Murder, you'll know that
Emily's husband does find out and he wants Emily dead. He plans the
"perfect murder" in which David is the killer. The plan is foolproof -- or
is it?
The plot unfolds slowly and is deliciously evil. Which makes the ending
feel somewhat like a cheat.
Director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive) tries to redeem himself here after his
horrible Chain Reaction. And Davis does an admirable job with A Perfect
Murder -- though, it never reaches the heights that his The Fugitive did.
The look of the film is engrossing with its high contrast lighting. This
has been done before and better -- look at Douglas's last film, The Game,
for this.
Performance-wise the best comes from Viggo Mortensen. Mortensen is one of
the most underrated and underused actors in Hollywood -- this is a shame
because Mortensen is a versatile and talented actor. If you've never seen
Mortensen, check out Crimson Tide and G.I. Jane also.
If Gwyneth Paltrow's Sliding Doors character had a third story line, A
Perfect Murder would have been it. Paltrow does nothing new here. Following
in Paltrow's footsteps, Douglas is not doing anything either. Douglas
almost seems like he didn't leave the set of his last film, The Game.
Paltrow and Douglas's lack in the performance arena doesn't hurt the film
at all though. The script is well written enough to make us overlook these
flaws.
One performance to look for is David Suchet as the head police
investigator. His part is small, but he makes a good impression.
Overall, I really liked A Perfect Murder and I recommend it. The film is
not a perfect murder, but it is still quite a good killing.

Title
Review for Lost World: Jurassic Park, The (1997)
There are some movies that you go to see for the plot and character 
development.  Then there are the movies that you go to see for the fun factor 
and the special effects.  The Lost World is in the latter category.
After seeing the first movie, Jurassic Park, I did not expect too much walking 
into the theatre.  I was there to see dinosaurs.  In The Lost World we find 
out that there is a Site B from the first movie.  Hammond used Site B, located 
about 80 miles away from the original island, to breed and raise dinosaurs for 
the main Jurassic Park island.  We find out that after the first island was 
dismantled and all the dinosaurs killed, no one knew about the second island.  
The dinosaurs thrived there and continued to live without human interruption.  
That is until a rich family sails to the island.  A dinosaur attacks the 
daughter of the family and this sets off the story.  InGen has now been taken 
over by Hammond's nephew.  Hammond is still alive and wants to leave the 
island alone and let the dinosaurs live there.  Hammond's nephew has other 
ideas.  Hammond calls four people to go and document the dinosaurs on the 
island in their natural habitat before his nephew and InGen get there.  Ian 
Malcolm is forced into going to the island because Hammond has sent his 
girlfriend there.  Ian's daughter hitches a ride and shows up on the island 
too.  It isn't long until InGen shows up.  They, under the command of 
Hammond's nephew, are there to round up dinosaurs for the Jurassic Park in San 
Diego.  After this point, there story stops and the action begins.
The dinosaurs this time around have more screen time.  And they look better 
than ever.  The scenes in which the dinosaurs interact with humans are so 
amazing, that it would leave most people wondering how they did that.  One 
example of this would be a scene in the beginning where the InGen team is 
rounding up dinosaurs.  Humans are tying up dinosaurs.  If you are going to 
see this film for the dinosaurs, you will not be disappointed.
The actual look of the film is darker and grittier than the first.  The first 
was filled with bright colors and sunlight.  The costumes were as if they came 
out of a comic book.  This time around though, most of the action takes place 
at night.  The film itself looks grainier.  There is an overall more serious 
feel to the film.
The one that I have to mention is the sound.  Jurassic Park launched DTS, 
Digital Theatre Sound.  The Lost World also uses DTS, and the end result is 
wonderful.  Sounds literally circle the theatre.  If you have the chance be 
sure to see The Lost World in a DTS equipped theatre.
The bottom line for The Lost World is to go into the theatre not expecting too 
much in the plot, character, and story department.  Go to see The Lost World 
for the fun factor and special effects.  Unlike last summer's special effects 
driven Independence Day, Spielberg wastes no time in between action sequences 
and special effects sequences.  The movie is fast moving and does not stop 
once everyone reaches the island.  As for taking the kids to see The Lost 
World, this movie is very intense, and I would not recommend it for younger 
children.

Title
Review for Jackal, The (1997)
The Jackal is the longest two hours I've spent in a theatre in recent
memory. I'm not sure what to call this movie. It could be a thriller, but
it doesn't thrill. It could be an action film, but there's not enough action.
The Jackal is an assassin that nobody can identify. As one FBI agent
reports, they don't even know if The Jackal really exists. The movie
follows two stories in parallel; one follows a group of good guys who are
trying to protect a government official against The Jackal. On this team is
the Deputy Director of the FBI, Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier), Major
Valentina Koslova (Diane Venora), and an IRA sharpshooter Declan Mulqueen
(Richard Gere). It is this story line is the one that is lacking and slows
the movie to a grinding halt. The other story line follows The Jackal
himself. This is the more interesting story line, and like in Heat, this
story line made me cheer for the bad guy more than I did for the good guys.
Bruce Willis seems to be having a great deal of fun portraying a bad guy.
And though his character is the master of disguise, no matter what disguise
Willis dons, he's still Bruce Willis. That's OK though, this part of the
film was fun.
The Jackal, next to being a master of disguise, is a man of gadgets. He's a
high-tech guy who uses the Internet to conduct illegal business, he uses a
cell phone, and his high-tech weapon is remote controlled from his
notebook. With all of this under his belt though, The Jackal did some
pretty stupid things during the film. I won't spoil it, but the character
of The Jackal conflicted with itself.
Chuck Pfarrer (Hard Target) who scripted this version of the 1973 The Day
of The Jackal builds up the story slowly and the pay-off is just not there.
The script is too predictable. I sat through the film mentally predicted
what would happen next, and not to my surprise, I was always right. The
script also takes huge skips in logic and the pace of the film gives the
audience too much time to find these skips of logic.
The action in the film, whatever there was, was flat and bland. The part
that I loved and made me chuckle, though wasn't supposed to, was during an
action sequence where Gere's Mulqueen is forced to hug a light post, he
sure does grimace well. At least with Pfarrer's Hard Target script there
was John Woo at the helm and the action was enough to pull that film out of
the hole (it had two things going against it, one was the weak script and
the second was Jean-Claude Van Damme). In The Jackal though Michael
Canton-Jones is unable to find anyway of pulling this film out of the hole.
Not everything is bad; there are some good things about this film. First
off, Willis is a joy to watch. Many people wonder why people -- like myself
-- like this guy, I think it's just because he is fun to watch, especially
during this film. The second thing I liked was the opening credits with its
SE7EN-like title sequence and music. Poitier does a great job with his part
and is the only person on the good guys' team that is likeable.
The Jackal is a slow moving predictable film that doesn't have the pay-off
to have an audience wade through its two hours. Though Willis is very
enjoyable, his story is only half of the film and the other half of the
film you'll just be saying to yourself, "Get back to The Jackal, these guys
are boring." Skip The Jackal, it's not worth the two hours spent in the
theatre.

Title
Review for Thirteenth Floor, The (1999)
What a difference time can make. Time is an important factor with The
Thirteenth Floor. And it is with time that The Thirteenth Floor fails. The
film runs too long and was released too late. These aren't its only
failings though.
On the 13th floor of some corporate building, a project is being tested.
This ultra-secret and ambitious project allows for people to jack into a
computer-generated world. Are the people in the computer-generated world
are so real that they could come out and hurt someone in the "real" world?
The world generated by the computer is of Los Angeles around 1937.
The project is headed by Hammond (Armin Mueller-Stahl) Fuller and his right
hand man Douglas (Craig Bierko) Hall. When someone murders Fuller, an LAPD
detective, McBain (Dennis Haysbert) suspects that Hall is the murderer.
Hall has everything to gain from the death of Fuller, including the whole
company that Fuller started. But, things get more complicated as Fuller's
daughter Jane (Getchen Mol) arrives in town to take control of the company.
The movie flips between the current time, which isn't specified, but I take
it to be 1999, and the computer-generated 1937. And it is in these trips
back and forth that The Thirteenth Floor makes its first time based error.
The trips do not really serve much purpose, some of the travel does reveal
information, but for the most part the travel is unneeded.
The murder mystery that is at the heart of the movie is flat. The romance
that supposedly exists between Douglas and Jane fizzles. And thrill in the
movie is rather tame. There are also a few attempts at some action
sequences, but those are rather dull also.
The plot of the film is so meticulously setup that at about an hour into
the film I was able to correctly predict how the film was going to end. The
script by Josef Rusnak and Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez contain some good ideas,
but all have already been covered and done by the more exciting and
thrilling The Matrix. And because the ideas have been done before and done
better, this is where The Thirteenth Floor makes its second time based
error. The release time of The Thirteenth Floor was too late. While The
Matrix is still doing well in the theatres, why would anyone go to see the
mediocre at best The Thirteenth Floor?
The movie comes out of the production house of Roland Emmerich and Dean
Devlin, the two guys who brought us Universal Soldier, Stargate,
Independence Day, and Godzilla. Some may argue that I should have known
better. For those of you who have read my Independence Day and Godzilla
reviews, you know that I'm not a big of fan of anything that comes from
Emmerich and Devlin. (For the record though, I did enjoy Stargate). So, why
would I go see The Thirteenth Floor? One reason only: Getchen Mol.
Mol who didn't get enough to do in Rounders also gets relegated to doing
not much in The Thirteenth Floor. That's too bad because I think that she's
got great talent. If only someone in Hollywood will give her something
worthwhile to work with. Mueller-Stahl is also not given enough material to
work with. He is the best actor in this film and that's a waste of talent.
Haysbert goes over-the-top with his portrayal of Detective McBain and it
goes to his advantage. His McBain is one of the most memorable characters
of the film because of Haysbert's performance.
As for the lead actor in the film, Bierko, that is one of the failings of
the film. Bierko, who does a mean imitation of George Clooney, is bland and
ineffective in his role. He has two types of onscreen emotions, angry or
confused. Because Bierko is the point of view of the film, him being the
weak link is a point against the film.
The one thing that I loved about the film is the cinematography. When you
look at the film you can tell that the cinematographer, Wedigo von
Schultzendorff, spent a lot of time with director, Josef Rusnak, planning
out the look of the film. The distinct look of the 1937 world compared to
the 1999 world is wonderful. The 1937 world is brown and colorless, it is
also not a perfect recreation of the 1937 Los Angeles, but one of which
Fuller remembers. The 1999 world is bluish-green and a bit more futurist
looking than being set in the 1990s. Kudos to von Schultzendorff for a
beautiful looking film.
Had The Thirteenth Floor been a shorter film and had been released a year
or two earlier, it would be a film to recommend. But, at this point, what
the film presents has been done and has been done better and there is
nothing to recommend about this film. Should you see The Thirteenth Floor?
No, don't see on the big screen nor on video for a good movie about
alternate computer-generated realities, for that watch The Matrix. But, if
you like Gretchen Mol or want to see some beautiful looking cinematography,
then check out The Thirteenth Floor on video.

Review for Primal Fear (1996)
Primal Fear is a movie in which Richard Gere gives one of his best
performances yet.  Primal Fear is more than just a show case for Richard
Gere's acting abilities, it also show cases the acting abilities of all the
supporting cast, including one great performance by Edward Norton.
Primal Fear follows the life of Martin Vail (Richard Gere) who is a high
profile lawyer that is known to most all in the city of Chicago and gets
magazine cover interviews.  Vail chases high profile cases instead of
ambulances, he believes that everyone should get a good defense, and he
doesn't care if the person is guilty or not, he just wants to defend them.
That is until he runs in to Aaron Stampler, who is accused of the murder of
the Archbishop of the church where Stampler is an altar boy.
Primal Fear has many threads running throughout the movie, and eventually
the all tie together, but it is not so obvious how they will.  The script
for Primal Fear is literate and does not treat the audience like idiots.
This movie serves to show case the acting talents of more than just Richard
Gere.  Along with Edward Norton as Aaron Stampler, Laura Linney, John
Mahoney, Alfre Woodard, Frances McDormand all give well balanced
performances throughout the film.
I highly recommend Primal Fear, it is a smart well written film that is
can't be missed.

Review for Escape from L.A. (1996)
In the year 2000 Los Angeles is flattened and separated from mainland US by a 
large earthquake. The President of the United States predicted this incident. 
And after the earthquake, the President makes it possible for the term of 
office to be life-long. This is no regular President either, he flies in the 
Air Force Three and is a very religious person. L.A. is turned into a prison 
island, where the murderers, rapists, thieves, and atheists are sent for the 
rest of their lives.
Snake Plissken, a well known military man and now criminal, is caught and 
given an offer. The offer comes from the President. His daughter after 
spending some time, together with a bad gangster on L.A. island, in a virtual 
reality world, has now run away. She's run away with a very dangerous weapon, 
and the President's offer to Snake is to get the device back. Snake would then 
be forgiven for all his past wrongdoings. Snake doesn't really want to do it, 
but is convinced into it after learning that he has a deadly virus coursing 
through his system. And, using a classic movie device, the virus is a timed 
virus. Snake on has less than a day to get the device back before he dies. If 
he gets the device back, he gets the antidote.
Escape From L.A. is a grand escapist film. It takes us to the Island L.A., 
which looks like sets from Blade Runner after a large earthquake. The action 
in Escape is wildly over the top and satisfyingly fun. The action ranges from 
underwater submarine rides to surfing a tsunami. Kurt Russell's Snake is a 
tough guy with a low grumbling voice and a dark sense of humor. 
I have not seen Escape from New York, which was the "prequel" to Escape From 
L.A., so I cannot give a comparison to it. 
Escape From L.A. is an awesome two hours that tries to be nothing more than 
what it is, an action film. There is a large dose of violence in the film that 
makes the film unsuitable for the younger crowd and the squimish. If you like 
action films don't miss Escape From L.A.


Title
Review for Godzilla (1998)
Knowing that Godzilla came from the "creative" team of Emmerich and Devlin
- the two dudes that brought us Independence Day and Stargate - I stepped
into my screening of Godzilla with: 1) my brain turned "off", 2) ready for
an adrenaline rush, and 3) ready for a roller coaster ride.
Let's just say that I walked out of the movie thinking that their horrible
Independence Day was a masterpiece compared to Godzilla and I did not have
a hint of adrenaline rushing through my blood stream. If Godzilla were a
roller coaster ride, it would be a ride with a few loops, some
not-so-steep-drops, and miles of level track before the next excitement.
Some nuclear testing done in the middle of nowhere creates Godzilla --
who's not looking quite like himself in this US version. For some reason
Godzilla wants to move off his little island, and where does he want to go?
New York, New York of course - the city so nice, they named it twice. All
animals have migratory periods and it is time for Godzilla to migrate, but
why?
"Why" does not matter to the US Army because all it wants is to annihilate
Godzilla. Biologist Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) has other ideas,
though. He thinks that Godzilla - thanks, marketing department at
Sony/Tristar for revealing this during the trailers - is pregnant and wants
to nest in New York. The Army thinks Tatopoulos is crazy, not because
Tatopoulos is a nut, but because this is how it always works in the movies:
The guy who has the right idea is the guy who is always treated like an idiot.
Unbeknownst to the US Army, the French Secret Service is also interested in
why Godzilla is in New York. A group of French Secret Service agents, led
by Philippe Roche (Jean Reno), is out to destroy Godzilla too.
Because this script comes from Emmerich and Devlin, there has to be a
non-emotional, one sided, "love" story that tries to pull our chains long
enough to make us cry. It seems that a reporter want-to-be, Audrey Timmonds
(Maria Pitillo), was Tatopoulos' love interest eight years ago in college.
She sees him on TV and tries to re-light the romance between them.
I really wanted to like Godzilla. I grew up watching the corny and cheezy
TV shows as a kid. I loved it when Godzilla - obvious to even a kid that it
was a guy in a rubber suit, but hey, Godzilla was cool - ran through cities
roasting people, buildings, and military with his breath of fire. In
Emmerich and Devlin's Godzilla, the big guy only gets to use his fiery
breath twice! This is a complete disappointment.
Godzilla is held back by two things: a weak script and horrible acting.
Script? What script? Like Independence Day, Emmerich and Devlin have penned
a script that sounds, and feels, like a fourth grader wrote it. The
characters excel at speaking cliched lines and the action is far and few. I
disliked Independence Day because of its weak script, but the Independence
Day script is Shakespeare compared to Godzilla.
As I watched Matthew Broderick on screen, I kept wondering if his
performance was purposely bad or if he's lost his acting ability. At best,
Broderick looks like a freshman drama student reading from cue cards. At
worst, it looks as if Broderick did not want to be in the production was
trying everything he could to be fired. Either way, Broderick, who we have
to follow throughout the film, gives a bad performance.
Jean Reno escapes unscathed; he did a decent job with his part as the
French Secret Serviceman. There were two roles that disgusted me and were
supposedly comic relief for the film. These were New York Mayor Ebert, and
his assistant, Gene. One was chubby with white hair and the other was
skinny and bald and they both like to use their thumbs; you get it? The
first time these characters took the screen I chuckled. The second time
they graced the screen I smiled. The third time I thought the joke was
getting old. After the third time, I stopped counting. These two roles did
nothing for the "story line," wasted screen time, and served only as an
in-joke for Emmerich and Devlin. Like everything else in Godzilla, this
didn't work because it was used in excess.
As for Godzilla, the effects are good, but nothing new. Emmerich and Devlin
chose to stay with the tried and true computer graphics for Godzilla. Sure,
Godzilla looks ferocious in the first attack on the Big Apple, but, after a
few more shots of him, he gets boring. The film was shot in constant rain
to hide the flaws of putting such a huge beast in a cityscape, and this
rain detracts from the total effect of the film. Godzilla just looks
generic on screen. Skip ahead to the next paragraph if you don't want to
know why Godzilla comes to New York. Godzilla's "babies," which look
suspiciously like the raptors from Jurassic Park and Lost World, are OK. At
times these little babies are so computer generated and move in such
synchronocity that they look like the squad of cheerleaders from the local
high school. This takes away heavily from the scare factor.
So what? Experience with Independence Day tells us that there are going to
be lulls in a Emmerich and Devlin film. But there's always spectacular
adrenaline pumping action scenes, right? Wrong. Emmerich must have had a
fluke with Independence Day because the action and the "scary" scenes in
Godzilla brought on more yawning than it did jumping from seats. Spielberg,
who did the two Jurassic Park films, shows that he knows how to bring on
the scares with his dinosaurs. Emmerich shows that he is just a hack at it.
Godzilla stands taller than a high rise, he runs faster than Apache
helicopters, and he breathes fire, yet Emmerich is never able to make the
tension level in the theatre rise higher than that in a convalescent home.
As for the movie score, there are three things that can make a score
distracting: it can be too loud, it can come at the wrong moments, and it
can sound so borrowed from another film leaving the audience wondering
which film the score came from. David Arnold, whose Tomorrow Never Dies
score I really enjoyed, comes to work with Emmerich and Devlin again.
Arnold makes one mistake with his Godzilla score; it sounds too much like
Mark Mancina's Speed music. There are points in the film where it sounds
like Arnold has taken directly from Mancina's work. And for me it was quite
distracting for half the movie because I couldn't figure out where I had
heard the tune.
But, in the end, nothing I or any of my fellow film critics can say that
will dissuade anyone from seeing this awful piece of filmmaking. The studio
hype is all that counts nowadays and the hype for Godzilla was huge. I
doubt even bad word-of-mouth from the average filmgoer will dissuade any of
their friends from seeing Godzilla - curiosity will prevail in this case.
Godzilla runs a whopping two hours and 12 minutes, which is too long for
this type of movie. Had Emmerich cut some of the non-essential stuff this
might have been a fun ride. Had Emmerich and Devlin written a smarter
script that doesn't try to create stories for one-dimensional characters,
this might have been a fun ride. But, I digress, this is a Emmerich and
Devlin film we're talking about and they love excess. Skip Godzilla.
Size Does NOT Matter - Godzilla proves this. It's quality that matters and
Godzilla has none of that. Skip, skip, skip.

Title
Review for Chain Reaction (1996)
Have you ever had that sinking feeling that something is going to be bad? Then 
have the sinking feeling be confirmed. As I started watching Chain Reaction, 
directed by Andrew Davis (The Fugitive, Under Siege) starring Keanu Reeves, I 
got that sinking feeling. And as I continued to watch the film, the feeling 
got worse and worse. 
In a world that is reliant on petroleum, wouldn't it be wonderful to find a 
cleaner more abundant source of energy? Something like water? That is the 
basis for Chain Reaction, and early in the film this is achieved by the luck 
of Eddie Kasalivich (Keanu Reeves). Eddie is a machinist for a hydrogen 
project that is working to, I'm confused with their explanation, split 
hydrogen from water and use that to create a cleaner energy source. 
But this discovery is all for not. Later that night, after a party celebrating 
the discovery, Eddie takes a coworker home and then heads back to the lab. As 
he arrives, alarms are sounding, and as he gets inside, he discovers that the 
head scientist on the project has been murdered, and another scientist is 
missing. He also sees that the hydrogen tank is completely unstable, and is 
about to blow. Eddie makes a run for it and barely escapes an explosion that 
levels eight square blocks. 
After this point, the movie goes into a chase mode. But that is not low point 
of the movie. The movie takes place in Chicago, the FBI is on the hunt for the 
innocent Eddie and his coworker and is directed by Andrew Davis. Strangely 
enough the one armed man is missing from this film. Chain Reaction is a cheezy 
remake of The Fugitive. But there are a few other things missing next to that 
one armed man. 
For one the strong performers are missing. Keanu is no Harrison Ford, and Fred 
Ward is not even close to being Tommy Lee Jones. Also missing is the 
intelligence of The Fugitive. Eddie is a dope, the conspiracy behind all the 
mayhem has no intelligence, and ideas behind most of the chases are 
preposterous. Keanu's character Eddie is a complete idiot in the movie. I 
wonder what Eddie is thinking when he does some of the things he does in the 
movie, and in most cases, I don't think his character is thinking anything. 
Fred Ward doesn't come close to Tommy Lee Jones, often squinting his eyes in 
some sort of effort to look tough, but coming off as some rookie actor. He 
also delivers lines that were not as convincing as Jones did in The Fugitive. 
He also has a group of rag-tag agents helping him out, and if I'm not 
mistaken, some of those agents were actually on the US Marshall's team in The 
Fugitive. The conspiracy behind all of this mayhem is headed up be the Central 
Intelligence Agency but shows no intelligence at all. I often wondered why 
they would be trying to frame, kill, and or get killed the only guy who knows 
how to make the hydrogen project work.
If I said that the chases were awful I would be lying. Though the story and 
characters are weak, most all of the chase sequences are well done. Though 
there feels to be one too many chase sequences.
Chain Reaction is a cheap cheezy try at trying to recreate The Fugitive. But 
its efforts are all but lost in its weak script and bad acting. Forget seeing 
this film and go and rent Andrew Davis' better film, The Fugitive.


Title
Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
Bruce Willis has got a strange on and off movie career. Usually, it's in the 
off position. But, once in a long while, he'll have a good film. The 5th 
Element is one of the latter. The commercials which ran for the movie, 
initially, promised, "The Star Wars of the '90s." A hard name to live up to.
Willis plays a retired space marine type in this movie. His character's name 
is Korben Dallas. Dallas has now retired and lives in a nice small apartment 
in the mid-23rd century. A great evil in space is about to kill every living 
being on Earth. There seems to be no way to stop it. At least that's how it's 
seen by the government. A priest knows better. There are the four elements, 
which are in the form of bars. Then there is the fifth element, a being that 
is the catalyst for the weapon to stop this great evil. The only problem is 
that the aliens that were transporting these elements were shot down in space. 
The only thing recovered from the crash landing site was a portion of the 
fifth element. With this portion, they use a super-computer to spin up a new 
fifth element being. The fifth element is played by the beautiful, and oddly 
red headed, Milla Jovovich. From here the fifth element "drops in" on Korben 
Dallas, and they with the priest are off to find the other four elements.
The story in The 5th Element is not too strong. What is strong in this movie 
are the special effects and the set design. It is the vision of the future 
that is put into this movie that sets it apart from other mediocre sci-fi 
movies. The visions of the future that are presented are of the caliber of 
those of "Blade Runner" and "Metropolis." Though not as dark as those 
presented in Blade Runner, the city in which Dallas lives is large, and the 
hover car chase early in the film is something to awe at. The other sets, 
including a futuristic cruise liner, Zorg's office, and the apartment building 
in which Dallas lives are also places to awe at. Along with these beautiful 
places are the costume design. The police have the best outfits, large, bulky, 
with a large lamp over the right side of their chest, and gun holstered above 
the left shoulder.
The 5th Element is a movie to be seen, literally. The sights in this movie 
outweigh the story. The story itself is not too bad, it's enough to keep the 
movie going along, but it is the presentation of the future that should really 
be seen in The 5th Element.

Title
Review for Scream (1996)
Scream is a movie that is not afraid to poke fun at the genre from which it
comes from.  Wes Craven is well known for his horror films, his most known
is Nightmare on Elm Street.  In Scream Craven knows that the slasher films
are dead, and that most audiences aren't going to be scared of a murderer
in a mask, or are they?
In Scream all the characters are literate in horror films.  They know the
ins and the outs of what to do if there is a crazed serial killer in your
town.  They know who and who are not at risk of falling victim to the
crazed serial killer.  And this sets up for a strange horror film that is
funny in most respects.  Craven makes good at building up tension in each
scene, and if it is not a scene where tension is needed, Craven keeps us
guessing as to who the killer really is.  Craven, working off of Kevin
Williamson's script, crafts a movie that is not a complete spoof or comedy,
but is a tense scary film that doesn't worry about poking fun at itself.
All the actors and actresses put in a good effort in Scream.  It was nice
to see Skeet Ulrich with a better role to work with, the last time I saw
him he was in the disappointing film Touch with Bridgette Fonda.  Neve
Campbell does a good job as Sidney the main character in Scream.
The film is fun, but it is not for the weak of heart or stomach.  The film
is a horror film so a lot of blood shed is expected, but the film does get
pretty violent at times.  If you're in for a good scare, see this film.  If
you want a fun film to watch, see this film.  Don't miss Scream.  And as a
character reminds us, never ever say, "I'll be right back."

Title
Review for Return to Paradise (1998)
Return to Paradise is a movie that has a great morality play. It uses the
characters to force us to ask ourselves one question Is the life of a
friend worth three years of your life?
As Return to Paradise opens, we learn of three friends Sheriff (Vince
Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad), and Lou (Joaquin Phoenix). They are speding
their vacation together in Malaysia - smoking hash, having sex with exotic
women, and enjoying the quiet life. Sheriff is a limo driver, Tony an
architect, and Lou a self proclaimed tree hugger. As their vacation ends
the three decide what to do. Sheriff and Tony decide to fly back to New
York, but Lou wants to stay and help free orangutans.
Two years later Sheriff and Tony are approached by a lawyer, Beth (Anne
Heche), who tells them what happened to Lou right after they left. It turns
out that Lou was caught with the hash and has been imprisoned for the last
two years. Compounding this news is the fact that Lou has only seven days
to live. The Malaysian government takes drugs seriously and they have
sentenced Lou to death. The only thing that can save Lou is if both Sheriff
and Tony go back to Malaysia and accept their responsibility with the
drugs. In that case, Lou's life will be spared. If Sheriff and Tony return,
they will have to spend three years in prison to complete this deal to save
Lou.
Writers Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson have put together a tight and
engrossing script. The script never strays into melodrama and focuses
solely on the question of if these two friends will go back to save Lou.
Kudos to cinematographer Reynaldo Villalobos, who shoots this film
wonderfully. The film is shot with mostly grays, blacks, and whites. But,
Villalobos skillfully slips in some bright colors to match the emotions of
the characters onscreen.
The cast is superb. Vaughn, who I last saw in the Lost World, is the staple
for this film. His performance stands out. Vaughn plays Sheriff right on
the money - a guy who is hesitant to go back to Malaysia. Anne Heche
absolutely glows in Return to Paradise. Her portrayal of Beth is diverse,
hard-edged and pushy sometimes and soft and loving at other times. David
Conrad doesn't get enough screen time, but when he is on screen he matches
the performances of both Heche and Vaughn. As for Phoenix, he does well
with the minimal amount of work the script provides.
Director Joseph Ruben has a winner of a film. Return to Paradise is a Don't
Miss film. This film is remarkable - the writing is strong, the film looks
great, and the acting is near perfect. It's nice to have films like Return
to Paradise mixed in with the late summer films. It gives a good balance to
the explosions and gun-fights that typically populate the summer films.
Again, Don't Miss Return to Paradise.
After seeing this film, let me know if you'd trade three years of your life
to save the life of a friend.

Title
Review for Fire Down Below (1997)
I often ask myself after watching a Steven Seagal movie, "Why did I even
bother?" Seagal again uses his wooden acting abilities in Fire Down Below.
I'm not sure why Seagal has chosen recently to preach about nature in his
films, but as well intentioned it might be, it just does not belong in this
kind of action movie. In On Dangerous Ground he preached about offshore oil
drilling, in Fire Down Below he preaches about toxic dumping. To say the
least, the preaching is very distracting, and often leads to some silly
character building scenes that just don't work.
Is Fire Down Below entertaining and fun? Nope, it was a painful experience.
Thought there were some action scenes in Fire Down Below, including a fight
between a semi and a small truck, there was too much lag time between the
action. I've also noticed that as Seagal gets older the quicker the cuts
and closer the camera is during the fight scenes. The fight scenes in Fire
Down Below are a disappointment, using lighting fast cuts, unsteadycam, and
super close ups.
The plot is easy; a rich millionaire is dumping toxic chemicals into the
backwoods. He has his son out there "taking care" of EPA guys. Seagal is
the tough-as-nails EPA guy who, unlike the previous EPA guys, can take care
of himself, thank you. While there Seagal runs into a young woman, for whom
he falls in love with. Pretty thin as a plot, but what is expected of a
Seagal film?
This film is down right awful and no one should suffer the pain of it. I'm
sure Seagal has good intentions by putting these pro-Earth messages in his
films, but they just do not work. The film needs more action and less
talking. Seagal needs to learn inflection in his speech also. Under Siege
was probably Seagal's best film, I enjoyed that film a lot. Fire Down Below
does not come close to Under Siege. I remember why I bother to go see
Seagal films, he makes them in intervals long enough so that people forget
how awful his films really are. I hope that I remember next time a film
starring Seagal comes out. Miss this film, it's not worth your money or the
two hours you spend sitting through it.

Title
Review for Object of My Affection, The (1998)
Jennifer Aniston has always been my favourite "Friend."  I was fairly
disappointed with Picture Perfect, her first film where she held a leading
role.  I knew that Aniston could do much better than that.  So, when I saw
the previews for The Object of My Affection, my heart was aglow with
anticipation. I hoped that The Object of My Affection would be much better
than Picture Perfect.
Nina Borowski (Jennifer Aniston) is a social worker in the Bronx.  She is
dating an obnoxious loud mouth jerk, Vince (John Pankow).  At a dinner
party hosted by Nina's step-sister, Nina meets George (Paul Rudd) who is a
first grade teacher. Nina finds out that George's current lover, Robert
Joley (Tim Daly), is about to leave him. She thinks that it would be nice
to a roommate and what better to have a gay roommate?
After George moves in, he and Nina find that they have a lot in common.
They find themselves at the local community center taking dancing lessons.
They find themselves eating ice cream in bed together watching old movies.
They find themselves at the amusement park together.  They are best
friends.  But, Nina feels something that George doesn't and can't return;
she is in love with George. 
Nina and George's relationship also puts a strain on Nina and Vince's
relationship.  Nina's pregnancy by Vince pushes the strain of their
relationship overboard and they breakup.  Nina decides that she doesn't
want a jerk like Vince raising the child but would like to have George fill
in as the father.  George is ecstatic about being able to be a plug-in dad
for a child.
What Nina discovers is that though she is trying to keep her relationship
with George platonic, she is becoming more and more jealous of George and
his newfound lover, Paul James (Amo Gulinello).
The Object of My Affection rests on having the relationship between Nina
and George seem genuine.  With Aniston and Rudd in these parts the
relationship is very real.  I thought that Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan had
some good screen chemistry in City of Angels, but this puts Cage and Ryan
to shame.  I'm sure Cage's angel would give up his wings for screen
chemistry like that between Aniston and Rudd; it just seems so cute.
Aniston redeems her Picture Perfect performance with The Object of My
Affection.  She is given a lot more to do in the newer movie and she rises
to the challenge.  Aniston has a luminosity about her that makes her seem
so alive and friendly.  Rudd is wonderful as George.  He gives enough of a
performance to overcome the boring role that he was given.
Most of the minor characters are thin and non-memorable.  However, two
stand out:  Alan Alda's name-dropping, publishing mogul step-brother-in-law
and Nigel Hawthorne's gay theatre critic.  It is Hawthorne's character that
makes the movie's theme clear near the end of the film.
The Object of My Affection starts out as a romantic comedy but about
halfway through changes to become a thoughtful romantic drama.  It is a
film that explores the relationship between a gay man and a straight woman
without putting either of them in a stereotypical role as we saw in My Best
Friend's Wedding or In and Out. With this said, The Object of My Affection
is also a commercial film and some of the scenes feel contrived -
especially the ending.  But, this is a small complaint because we are not
as focused on these things as we are on the relationship between Nina and
George.
Director Nicholas Hytner is able to keep the film moving along, though
parts of the middle section loses focus and seem to drag along.  Hytner is
able to grab our emotions occasionally throughout the film but is not able
to sustain this.
The Object of My Affection is a wonderful film that explores themes like
love, sex, and friendship.  It does a good job with each.  I'm happy that
Jennifer Aniston was able to do this film where she is the star instead of
her cleavage, as was the case in Picture Perfect. Aniston shines in The
Object of My Affection and with the outstanding performance from Paul Rudd,
these two are able to make The Object of My Affection a Don't Miss film.
Don't Miss The Object of My Affection and don't forget to take a loved one
with you.

Review for Antz (1998)
There is a splintering in the animation world: animated movies for kids
with subtleties to keep the adults' attention and animated movies for
adults with subtleties for kids. Antz falls into the latter category from
the get-go. As Antz opens we meet an ant named Z (voiced by Woody Allen.)
The movie starts off with Z explaining to his psychiatrist ant that he
feels he's not getting enough attention. It is not easy being the middle
child in a family of five million.
In an ant colony there are two primary groups of ants, worker ants and
warrior ants. Worker ants mindlessly slave away at their jobs - primarily
digging and earth-moving, while warrior ants are constantly preparing to
protect the colony against outside threats. Also in the colony is a Queen
ant (Anne Bancroft), a Princess ant Bala (Sharon Stone), and two military
leader ants, General Mandible (Gene Hackman) and Colonel Cutter
(Christopher Walken).
Z is a plain worker ant. His day consists of moving earth during the day,
going to a bar for some recuperation, sleeping, and then getting up to move
earth again. Z is different from all the other ants. He's a free thinker,
an ant who wants to be different.
Princess Bala is of the same type as Z. She wonders about what the other
ants do all day. She also wants to have some fun. Her life is not as great
as it may sound, being princess and all. She is engaged to marry the
militaristic-at-mind and maniacal General Mandible. After marriage, she is
expected to give birth to millions of ants. Bala wants to experience her
own life before taking on the life put together by her mother. So, one
night Bala sneaks out to the bar where Z and the other ants go to hang out.
As luck has it for Z, Bala chooses to dance with him. He is instantly
attracted to Bala, though he doesn't know that she's a princess. They have
one exciting dance, where Z helps plant the seed of individualism into
Bala's mind. Unlike the other ants that are dancing in-sync, Z and Bala
break free and dance as they want. Afterwards, Bala is in a rush to leave,
but not before Z finds out who she really is.
Z, knowing that he has no chance of meeting Princess Bala again, hatches a
hairbrained idea to try to meet her again. The warrior ants are going on a
parade for the Queen, General Mandible, and the Princess the following day.
Z wants to be there. Z arranges to switch places with his best friend, a
warrior ant, Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) so that he can march and maybe get
to see Bala again.
What Z doesn't know is that the warriors are being sent into battle to
fight invading termites, who are larger than ants and spit acid from their
foreheads. The battle that ensues is a computer-generated and ant-populated
version of Saving Private Ryan's opening battle sequence. This battle
sequence is quite intense.
Z returns as a war hero, but it is discovered that he is only a worker and
he kidnaps Bala during his escape. The two get lost and decide to search
for Insectopia, a place where ants don't have to work and food is lying out
in the open.
Antz is one part social commentary, one part romance, and one part comedy.
These parts fall into place perfectly and make Antz a wonderful animated
movie. The script by Todd Alcot and Chris Weitz tackles all three parts
well. Antz, as a mirror of our society, shows that most of us go to work,
come home to rest, sleep and then go into the same cycle the next day. Antz
is a microscopic view of a macroscopic world. We're all just like the
worker ants, repeating the cycle of a day over and over again. Z is the
perfect and subtle hero of the film, showing us that we don't have to be
the way we are. We can be free spirits and do what we like.
As for the voice acting, there's no way that the film could go wrong when
you look at the impressive list of talent: Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene
Hackman, Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Danny
Glover, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Anne Brancroft, and John Mahoney. The two
leads, Allen and Stone, do a wonderful job with their parts. Hackman brings
back memories of his performance in Crimson Tide with his performance as
General Mandible. Everyone else is just fantastic.
The big question on most people's minds is how good is the computer
animation? And the follow-up question is how well does it compare to Toy
Story? To answer the first question: the computer animation is fabulous.
And the answer to the second question: I wouldn't say that the animation is
better than Toy Story, but I wouldn't say that it's worse than Toy Story.
The quality of the animation shows that the people on this project have put
a lot of work into it. This shows quite easily in the long wide shots of
the ant colony where we can see, literally, millions of ants moving at the
same time. The animation also has a wow-moment during the ant-termite
battle. Kudos to Pacific Data Images for putting together such a beautiful
movie.
To me, the ants, though all of them different looking, all look like E.T.
with four legs and two arms. This is ironic since Antz is being distributed
and was produced by DreamWorks SKG - a company with Steven Speilberg as one
of the heads.
The music was unexpected for me. I walked in thinking that Antz was a
Disney-style animated movie and therefore would have lots of sing-along
songs. To my surprise Antz was neither a Disney-style animated movie or did
it have lots of sing-along songs. There were songs in the film, but these
songs were taken from popular culture. The score for the film, by Harry
Gregson-Williams (The Replacement Killers) and John Powell (Face/Off), fits
the film like a glove.
One recommendation is that parents not take too young of children to see
Antz. I recommend this for two reasons: First, though it is animated, the
film's aim is more at adults than children. The story line is dense and the
plot is complicated. Second, there are some intense moments in the film
that will startle children. The ant-termite battle is intense with images
of ants being melted by termite acid - the battle would be terrifying to
younger children. There is also a moment where a human takes a magnifying
glass and starts burning ants. This is shown in graphic detail - ants being
burned to a crisp. For older children the film should be fine and serves as
a teaching experience.
Antz is a great microscopic view of our society. Don't Miss Antz in the
theatres. This big film about small insects needs to be seen on the big
screen.

Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
This is going to be hard to say, but I'll say it because it's the truth:
Jim Carrey can act.
Carrey shows restraint as Truman Burbank, a man trapped unknowingly in a
live TV broadcast of his life. Discarded as an unwanted baby, he is the
first child to be adopted by a corporation. Truman's life is the center of
The Truman Show. The show is the creation of TV director Christof (Ed
Harris) who watches over Truman like a father.
A series of events lead Truman to dig deeper into his life, causing him to
find out that his life may have been fabricated. His wife, Meryl (Laura
Linney), his best friend, Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and his parents -- could
they all just be actors?
Writer Andrew Niccol (who directed and wrote last year's Gattacca) takes
the idea of a guy stuck in a TV show and runs with it. He makes us think:
Could our own lives be fabricated? How much acting do people around us do?
And Niccol brings meaning to Shakespeare's "All the world's a stage."; in
The Truman Show everyone is an actor except for Truman himself.
The Truman Show opens with the line: We're tired of pyrotechnics and
special effects And we are, let's have some creativity in Hollywood, let's
have some originality, let's have a movie that doesn't rely on computer
generated mutated iguanas. The Truman Show delivers on its laughs and it
delivers on a well-written story.
I've never completely liked Carrey. From his stint on In Living Color to
his movies afterwards, I never liked his rubber-faced antics, and sometimes
childish-for-shock humor. Lately though, some of his work has been
impressive. His "turn to drama" role in Liar Liar was enjoyable. His work
in The Mask was fitting. In The Truman Show, Carrey holds off on almost all
of his antics - there are still times where they show up - and it works for
the best. The Truman Show is a showcase for Carrey, showing that he can do
other stuff than the crap that he did in the Pet Detective movies.
Will Carrey ever be a Robin Williams? Maybe, but there is something about
Williams that Carrey just does not have. I can't put my finger on it, but
if you also feel the same please let me know.
Director, Peter Weir, should be given a lot of credit for the work he's
done with The Truman Show. The docu-drama look of the film works well and
does not become overly distracting. The humor is there and always works --
I loved the posters warning about travel in the travel agency office.
For those looking for an all out Jim Carrey comedy, like the Pet Detective
films, you'll be disappointed. The trailers for The Truman Show promote the
film wrongly: as a comedy. The Truman Show is more of a satirical look at
the wrongs of our society. Unlike most all of Carrey's old films its a
thinking film.
Worth mentioning is the costume design by Marilyn Matthews and the
production design by Dennis Gassner. Matthew's costume design is old yet
very new. Complimenting this look are Gassner's sets which look so modern
but incorporate older designs that they are pleasing but not distracting. I
loved the look of The Truman Show.
If you avoid Jim Carrey films because of his antics, you might want to see
The Truman Show; you'll be pleasantly surprised. It's a fun film that is a
satire on the way our society stands. If not, just see it because it is a
beautiful looking film with some laugh-out-loud moments. I never thought
I'd say this about a Jim Carrey film, but: Don't Miss The Truman Show.

Review for Remember the Titans (2000)
Jerry Bruckheimer is one of those producers who surprise me from time to 
time.  He can come up with over-the-top stuff like Top Gun, utter garbage 
like Days of Thunder, and then he has those brilliant moments where he 
produces marvelously watchable movies like The Rock and Crimson 
Tide.  Remember the Titans falls into the last category, a marvelously 
watchable and entertaining film out of the Bruckheimer production stalls.
Remember the Titans takes place in 1971.  It is a movie that uses football 
as the backdrop for a story about race relations.  A new football coach 
moves into Alexandria, Va.  This coach, Coach Boone (Denzel Washington), is 
part of an integration program in Alexandria.  As events take it, the 
school board replaces current coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton) with Boone 
and this does not settle well.
The conflict in the movie is that of race.  The integration of the two 
major races in Alexandria causes much pain and this is shown in the 
microcosm present with the players as they go to training camp with coaches 
Boone and Yoast.  Together, the two coaches must both get their racially 
mixed team working together and also accept each other and work together to 
win.
Remember the Titans made me emotional from the get-go, something most 
movies can't do to me  even the most polished tear-jerker from Steven 
Spielberg can't do this!  The well-written script by Gregory Allen Howard 
and the steady direction by Boaz Yakin (Fresh) put me into tears by the end 
of the film.  This movie is the perfect definition of a feel-good film.
Denzel Washington and Will Patton both give excellent 
performances.  Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he 
lives up to that with his performance in Titans.  Patton who doesn't get 
enough plum roles is given a chance to really perform and he does.  The two 
performances are what nail this movie.  The other players are good also, 
though the script doesn't give us enough time to bond with all the 
players  I got a few of the players confused after a while.  But there are 
two standout performers, they are Wood Harris (as Big Ju) and Ryan Hurst 
(as Bertier).  These two performers are excellent.
Don't Miss Remember the Titans.  It will make you laugh and it'll make you 
cry.  But, in the end, Remember the Titans will make you feel good.  And 
Jerry, please produce more good movies like this.

Review for Hope Floats (1998)
Hope Floats is a paint-by-the-numbers film, but what a picture it paints.
Birdee (Sandra Bullock) Pruit is about to get the surprise of her life, on
national TV. Her husband is having an affair with her best friend. Birdee
was the "Queen of Corn" in the small town of Smithville, Texas. She married
her high school sweetheart, the quarterback of the high school football
team, and moved out of Smithville - heading for a big city.
With the breakup between Birdee and her husband, she returns to Smithville,
taking her daughter, Bernice (Mae Whitman) with her. Birdee moves in with
her mother, Ramona (Gena Rowlands). She also meets an old high school mate,
Justin (Harry Connick Jr.) with whom she starts a romance.
Hope Floats relies not on creativity but on cliches to move the story along
and to try to tug at our hearts and tears. In the case of the latter, it
did not produce any tears, but it did tug at my heart. The movie does move
along at a good pace.
Sandra Bullock returns to the genre that kicked off her stardom: the
romantic film. Bullock has shown in the past that she has a limited range
in her acting skills, and with Hope Floats she doesn't change that
standing. This is fine though because Bullock has a very down to earth,
girl-next-door, look and we feel at home with her onscreen presence.
Harry Connick Jr. hasn't really had any memorable large roles. The two
roles that I remember him by are his small role as a fighter pilot in
Independence Day and his somewhat larger role as the creepy killer in
CopyCat. Here in Hope Floats Connick does a decent job, but it is all but a
forgettable role and performance.
It is not Bullock's performance that sticks out in Hope Floats. It is the
performances of the child actors and the performance of Gena Rowlands as
Birdee's mom that stand out. Mae Whitman gives a good performance as
Birdee's daughter, though I had a hard time believing that the geeky
looking Whitman would be a product of Bullock and the quarterback husband.
The other child actor, Cameron Finley, as Birdee's nephew, is very
memorable. This kid has talent and it really shows onscreen. Gena Rowlands
as the animal-stuffing mother is the funniest role of the film.
Worth mentioning is the beautiful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel and the
bright production design by Larry Fulton. The combinations of these two
talents make what might be a drab film stand out. I loved the way Deschanel
shot Fulton's dance hall; look for this in the film.
The script by Steven Rogers works, but is not as good as it should have
been. Forrest Whitaker does a good job at keeping the movie moving along. I
found myself looking at my watch once during the film, but not much after
that.
My friend Theresa Perez, who caught an early preview of Hope Floats,
describes the film best: "It's a chick-flick." Hope Floats might not be the
perfect movie, but it is a beautiful movie and a good date film. I
recommend Hope Floats.

Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999)
Don't Miss Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace.
There's just so much to say about this film.  But, lets get one thing out
of the way before we begin.  Does The Phantom Menace live up to the hype?
No.  This doesn't mean that it's not a fantastic film though.  This film
has enough eye candy, ear shattering sound effects, and action to satisfy
everyone.  Strip away the hype and what you have is a popcorn film that
entertains for its full running time.  The Phantom Menace is a feast for
the eyes and ears but not the brain  it's all dessert and no main course. 
Much like the first film in the original trilogy, this film serves as the
basis and introduction for the coming two films.  Being so, the film has a
lot of exposition which sometimes slows the film down, but this isn't a bad
thing because when George Lucas lets loose of his imagination, it is
something that makes you forget about all the slowness of the film.
There is an evil force working to eliminate the peace that exists in the
galaxy and to also take control of the Galactic Republic.  When the Trade
Federation sets a blockade of a peaceful planet, Naboo, a Jedi Master,
Obi-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), and his Jedi Appretice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan
McGregor), are sent to negotiate.  The two Jedi's are met by an attempt on
their lives, which sends them down to the planet of Naboo.  At Naboo they
work to protect Princess Amidala (Natalie Portman) but are no match for the
army that is sent down to the planet.  From here the movie moves to the
planet of Tatooine where the group meets Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and
the apprentice to a mysterious Sith Lord, Darth Maul (Ray Park).
>From Tatooine the movie moves to a few other worlds and the story moves
along with a reasonable pace.  The Phantom Menace story does not have any
of the wonder or awe that the first three films had, nor does it have a
strong character that people can like  from the original trilogy I found
Han Solo the coolest.  Among the other characters featured in the film are
some familiar faces like Yoda, Jabba the Hutt, R2D2, and a barely
recognizable C3P0.
The actors in the main roles all give decent performances, though most of
them are a bit wooden.  Liam Neeson is perfect as Obi-Gon Jinn, a Jedi
Master who is wise yet sometimes rebellious.  Ewan McGregor picks up the
mannerisms and voice of Alex Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi from the original
trilogy) perfectly.  He is enjoyable onscreen, but he is not given enough
screen time  though I think this will change in the second and third films.
 Natalie Portman is somewhat flat as Queen Amidala, but she does fulfill
her role adequately.  The only performance that I thought was sub-par was
that of young Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker.  He does fine in the quiet
moments, but when he is asked to become ecstatic onscreen it comes off
wrong  watch as he flies around in a Naboo defense fighter near the end of
the film.
The cameo that I enjoyed the most was that of Samuel L. Jackson.  I knew
that Jackson had a cameo in the film, but I didn't know when and where.
Jackson has been high on my must-see actors list for a long time now and it
was a joy to see him in a movie of this magnitude  though he did have a
role in the second largest first-day-grossing film, Jurassic Park, his
presence in The Phantom Menace was more memorable.  I hope that he has a
larger recurring role in the next two films.
Another actor who didn't get many speaking parts but was very memorable was
Ray Park as Darth Maul.  Park doesn't get to speak much, but with that
hideous make-up and his lightning quick moves, his presence onscreen is
ominous and quite scary.  His make-up, for me, at first made me wonder what
Lucas was thinking.  But, after seeing Ray Park with the red and black face
paint and the little devil horns in action, I was convinced that Lucas is
brilliant in bringing Darth Maul to life in such a manner.  Is Darth Maul
as fear-inducing as Darth Vader?  No, but he's more of a formidable enemy
than Darth Vader was, as Darth Maul sports a double Lightsaber and has the
moves of a martial artist on speed.
I got John Williams's score for the movie the day it was released, about a
two weeks ago.  I enjoyed listening to the score  especially the track
titled `Duel of the Fates'  but, a film score is always missing something
when you hear it before you see the film.  After listening to the score
many times, I got used to the cues that were presented in the score and
during the screening of The Phantom Menace I got a taste of just how
brilliant a composer John Williams is. Williams's score plays for most of
the two hour plus running time of the film and at the 74 minute capacity of
a CD, you can see that there was a lot of music missing on the CD.  The
film score adds a whole new dimension to the movie.  As George Lucas writes
in the insert for the CD, `I like to think of the Star Wars films as silent
movies, movies whose stories are carried forward visually and by a musical
score.'  John Williams not only helps tell the story with his musical
score; his score at times is the story.  His score is restrained enough
that it does not overwhelm the audience and distract them from what is
onscreen, but it is powerful enough to move you.  Kudos to John Williams
for this dazzling score.
Lucas uses The Phantom Menace not as a storyboard to tell an elaborate
story with twists and turns.  Instead, he uses the film as a canvas.  At
the most basic level, The Phantom Menace is a film as a painting.  The
beautiful settings and sets in the film are enough to go see the film again
just to enjoy the views.  From the waterfall laden valleys in which the
capital city of Naboo resides to the underwater city to the ever-busy
Coruscant to the raceway on Tatooine to the Senate chamber, The Phantom
Menace screams of polished art, set, and production design.  The Phantom
Menace is a visual feast.
Not to let the art, set, and production design overwhelm you, Lucas throws
in gobs of `Isn't this cool?' type special effects.  Most every scene in
the film seems to have something digital added.  This brings me to one
complaint, although special effects can be used to help an audience see the
image that a director has in mind, sometimes the overuse of special effects
is detrimental.  And in some places in The Phantom Menace, the special
effects are just gratuitous, which jars the audience.  Science fiction has
to be somewhat believable and with some of the special effects Lucas pushes
the use of special effects a bit too far.  The biggest example of this
would be Jar Jar Binks, a completely computer generated actor.  Serving no
real purpose next to some comic relief, every time this character was
onscreen I flinched a little  his presence was not as bad as the Ewoks in
Return of the Jedi though.   Don't get me wrong, there are some special
effects that are jaw dropping good.  The best example of that would be the
pod race.
The action in The Phantom Menace is top notch.  The two standout sequences
are the aforementioned pod race in which we get to experience, both
visually and aurally, a high-speed race.  The race utilizes small pods
mounted behind big jet engines that gain speeds that are break-neck.  This
race had me at the edge of my seat, even though I knew how it was going to
turn out.  The way that the special effects were integrated and used in
this sequence was amazing.  The second standout action sequence is the
Lightsaber battle between Obi-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul.
I've never been so engaged by an action sequence before.  The sound in this
sequence shook the floor  every time Lightsabers clashed the floor shook
and the visuals of this sequence had my eyes glued to the screen.  The
sequence shows just how exciting a well-choreographed and tightly edited
fight sequence can be.  Both of these sequences were exhilarating.
Is The Phantom Menace flawed?  Yes.  Does it overcome its flaws?  Yes.
Should you go see the film?  It probably doesn't matter what my answer is,
but, yes, you should see this film.  Don't Miss Star Wars: Episode 1  The
Phantom Menace.  This movie can be enjoyed if you leave all the hype that
you've been exposed to at the front door of the theatre.  This film doesn't
have the awe of Star Wars or the smooth storytelling of Empire Strikes Back
but what it does have is enough visuals to make you want to come back for
multiple screenings.

Review for Pleasantville (1998)
Of the films I love, there are the good, the great, and the Pleasantvilles.
Pleasantville is a movie that says many things but never gets preachy. The
film draws you in from the start.
As the film starts, a barrage of television images hits us, as if we're
channel surfing with someone who hasn't found anything interesting to watch
yet. The frantic channel surfing finally stops at a family channel, which
features 50s TV shows. You know the type of shows, the ones that are
wholesome and good for the entire family. These are the shows that some
politicians want the world to be like, the shows that have "family values."
We find out that we were channel surfing with David (Tobey Maguire) who has
no social life and is pleasantly referred to as a "nerd" by his cooler
sister, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon). Jennifer is a girl who strives to be
cool: she acts like a slut, she doesn't read, and tonight she has a hot
date. David also has a hot date tonight: his is with a TV show marathon.
The TV show is called Pleasantville and the marathon has a trivia contest
with a cash prize of $1000. David is a big Pleasantville buff and can
answer any question about any episode of the show. He's ready to win.
David and Jennifer fight over the remote and it is torn to pieces. A
friendly TV repairman (Don Knotts) replaces the remote with a strange
looking one. After the repairman leaves, the fight for the TV remote is on
again - that is until David pushes the wrong button on the remote and both
he and Jennifer are sent directly into Pleasantville.
Pleasantville, the movie, is not the story of David and Jennifer trying to
escape from the TV show, though it starts out this way. Pleasantville is
the story of David and Jennifer trying to live and adapt in a world that is
black and white and has the same "family values" that everyone is now
talking about. Writer/director Gary Ross doesn't get preachy with this
theme, but he doesn't let the theme slip away either. 
The movie has the underlying message that there were flaws in those 50s
family values, and we should be careful in wishing for those times again.
With all the problems of the 90s, this is definitely the better place to
live. Sure, it's nice for a husband to come home at 6 pm, say, "Honey, I'm
home", and be seated fifteen minutes later to a hot dinner with the family.
But, how is it for the wife who spends the day slaving over the stove? Is
that what we really want today? Would this really work? Once changed,
things cannot easily change back, as David observes. David's Pleasantville
Mom (Joan Allen) finds this out early on when Jennifer teaches her what sex
is and then what she can do if Dad (William H. Macy) doesn't want to have
sex. This, like the other radical ideas that David and Jennifer inject into
this once stable community, starts the people thinking. The ideas that
David and Jennifer spread help the people of Pleasantville break out of
their "normal" lives into something more exciting.
The one thing wonderful about Pleasantville is how the movie slowly
transitions from a black and white to color. The special effects in the
movie work hand in hand with the story to the extent that we are left to
ponder why some of the Pleasantville citizens are in color and why others
remain black and white. From the first showing of color, the special
effects team has put a sense of awe into the movie. There is nothing more
spectacular than a bright red rose set on a black and white background. As
the movie progresses, more and more colors start to saturate the film.
Kudos to the special effects team at The Computer Film Company for making
Pleasantville so colorful.
The two lead performers in Pleasantville, Maguire and Witherspoon, are
excellent. Witherspoon handles her switch, from slut to smart, very well.
Maguire is subtle but good.
The two performances that stick out as great are those of Joan Allen and
William H. Macy. The scene where Allen gets to show off is a scene with
Maguire in which she is in color and is forced to find a way to cover up
the color that she likes. This is a scene that left the theatre silent,
except for some sobbing. Macy is a character actor who is at the top of his
game, no matter what. I loved the scene in which Macy comes home, puts his
jacket and suitcase down, hangs up his hat and cries out - like regular -
"Honey, I'm home!" only to find that his wife is not there. "Where's my
dinner?" he asks plaintively, many times, before resigning himself to the
fact that his life has changed forever.
Gary Ross, who wrote the touching film Big, debuts as a director with
Pleasantville. And he proves that he can write a good script and then turn
it into a brilliant realization on film. Ross's script is laced with enough
to plug up holes, which might have shown up if the script was written a
less talented person. For instance, the geography class doesn't learn about
"world" geography. There is no "world" in Pleasantville; the whole world
lives on Main Street. When asked where Main Street ends, the teacher simply
answers that the end of Main Street is the beginning. Kudos to Ross for
putting together Pleasantville.
Pleasantville is a Don't Miss film. Pleasantville makes us think,
entertains us, inspires us, and makes us laugh. There aren't many films
that can do all of this. Don't Miss Pleasantville - if there is just one
movie you see this year, see Pleasantville.

Review for Fan, The (1996)
Tony Scott is a gifted director at one thing: making a dull lack luster
film look glossy and attractive.  Sometimes he does more than just this, an
example would be his previous Crimson Tide.  With The Fan he has returned
to being the director who makes a lack luster film look glossy and attractive.
In The Fan Robert DeNiro is an obsessive baseball fan.  He is a troubled
man with all sorts of problems in his life, he can't see his son, he's on
the verge of losing his job, and, well, he's just a little wacky.  Wesley
Snipes gives a decent Barry Bonds impersonation in The Fan.  Snipes is a
recently acquired $40 million free agent for the San Francisco Giants from
the Atlanta Braves.
The Fan moves at a snail's pace for the first hour, and really does not
improve after that.  The first hour does only one thing, it shows how
DeNiro's Gil Renard is a crazed troubled man.  After that, the movie picks
up pace, following DeNiro and his "support" for Snipes' Bobby Rayburn.
But, this pick up of pace is not much of a help for the movie.
Scott does a wonderful job of filming and making this film look good.  But,
this is a complete loss because of the putrid script that he is shooting
with.  All of the characters are presented as cardboard cutouts.  And there
are even characters that I can't figure to why they are given such a big
role, one of those would be Ellen Barkin's Jewel Stern.  The baseball
scenes are, surprisingly, few.  This is good because the baseball scenes do
not feel all that authentic, especially the end climatic baseball sequence.
Tony Scott needs to be more selective when picking scripts to work with.
The Fan is obviously a skeleton worth of a script that needed a whole lot
of work before it was shot.  Scott needs to find more scripts like Crimson
Tide.  When he is given a good script to work with, Tony Scott can put out
a wonderful film.  But, when he is given a bad script to work with, his
talents for looks are wasted.  Skip The Fan, though Tony Scott has made
this lack luster film look glossy and attractive, it's only looks, there's
nothing of substance here.

Review for Devil's Advocate, The (1997)
I had my doubts about Devil's Advocate when I went to see it. Usually, I
clear my head of doubts (or any other biases) before going into see a
movie. It was a hard thing to do when the thought of Keanu Reeves playing a
big shot lawyer comes to mind. I'm happy to say that I stepped out of the
theatre without a doubt that Devil's Advocate is, so far, one of the best
films of this fall.
Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) is a small lawyer in Florida. But, he's a good
lawyer, never losing any of his sixty some odd cases. He's so good that a
big time law firm in New York wants his services. John Milton (Al Pacino)
heads the law firm. The story follows Lomax and his wife Mary Ann (Charlize
Theron) as they make the move from their little town in Florida to New York
where Milton puts them in a very nice apartment and showers them with
money. But, what for?
Devil's Advocate's twist on the story is that Milton is really the
human-ego of Satan himself. And logically, Satan would be a lawyer. This
twist is easy to believe, and it was not hard to suspend my disbelief when
this was revealed. Devil's Advocate is a large chunk of character study, on
both Lomax and Milton. It has a bit of supernatural horror thrown in for zest.
Reeves performs admirably, and he, at least in my mind, redeems himself for
his terrible performance in Chain Reaction. It was a little hard, at the
beginning, to believe that Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure
could be a lawyer, but it does work out after awhile.
Charlize Theron is perfect as Lomax's wife, Mary Ann. She plays the sexy
wife as a lonely woman who sees early on that the law firm and Milton are
not what they seem. She literally goes insane because Lomax starts to work
too hard for the firm.
But, the real show stealer is Al Pacino as John Milton. Pacino is way over
the top with his performance and it is this that makes Devil's Advocate
such a joy to watch. His performance, especially at the climax of the film,
is just dripping evil but still at the same time fun. Pacino has played
many parts in his life, and I've seen a few, and this one is on the top of
my list as one that everyone should see.
Taylor Hackford (Dolores Claiborne) does very well as the director of
Devil's Advocate, mixing real life with supernatural, and never going past
the point of driving the audience into disbelief.
Devil's Advocate is a definite Must See Movie that you shouldn't miss in
the theatres. The film is an all around winner, but if anything, see the
film for Pacino's excellent performance as the Devil himself.

Review for Army of Darkness (1993)
Army of Darkness is written for and aimed directly at teens. However, I
found that I enjoyed it a lot also. There is something about the film that
is amiable and welcoming.
Forget that Army of Darkness is really part three of the Evil Dead series -
knowledge of the first two films is condensed into a ten-minute
introduction. Army of Darkness is a stand-alone movie that really doesn't
rely on its older brothers. As the story goes, Ash (Bruce Campbell) is
sucked into the past by an evil book. In the past the only way he can get
home is to find the book again and say a few magic words.
Ash, in the previous movies, lost one of his hands to an evil form. He now
attaches a chainsaw to the stump of the missing hand. In the other hand, he
carries his shotgun or "boom stick." Don't bother with how a one handed guy
can load a shotgun - this isn't a movie about reality or logic.
As Ash finds the book of the evil watch as he recites the magical words.
This movie is the perfect mix of stupid humor, horror, and action. The
character Ash is played straight faced by Bruce Campbell and this works
very well. The kind of characters that I laugh most at and with are those
who are caught in silly situations but don't know it. Ash is one of those
characters and Campbell knows it. Campbell is cool as Ash.
Army of Darkness is like a live comic book in the truest sense. The editing
of the film is cut-cut-cut, no transitions needed. This editing accounts
for the short 81 minute running time - this include credits! This is a
hyperactive movie. If this movie were one of the evil dead, it would turn
pale from not breathing.
Worth mentioning are the special effects in Army of Darkness. There are
some that stand out, such as the actual army of darkness standing on a hill
ready to attack the castle. Then there are those special effects that are
laughable, and I'm not sure if it was intended or not. This would include
the bad matting of the "little Ashes" with the big Ash.
Also worth mentioning is Sam Raimi and his cinematographer Bill Pope for
putting together some intricate and inventive shots. I love how Raimi and
Pope shoot flying projectiles. 
I surely can't recommend this film to everyone. I can recommend it for
teens. I can recommend it for those of you looking for a funny medieval
flick. However, for those of you looking for more substance, you won't find
it here. There's only a bag of bones here.

Review for Good Will Hunting (1997)
We've all heard of this story line before: Boy-wonder-genius is discovered,
his know how is put to use by some scientist, when the government finds out
about his talent they put the boy-wonder to work for the government. As the
boy works for the government he discovers something completely outrageous
and some bad guys come hunting for the boy, trying to ax him. All I have to
say is: Thank goodness writers/actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck took a
different approach.
The title of this film has many connotations including holding the name of
the main character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon). Will is a young man who has
a special gift, mathematics (and most other college level stuff).
Everything is as easy to him as tying our shoelaces is to us. He can read
at impressive speeds and just know the material after reading it. By no
means is Will the type of guy like Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. Will is a
normal guy with an abnormal talent. Will spends his time as a janitor at
MIT and while cleaning the floors one night, Will solves a proof on a
chalkboard which catches the attention of a hardworking professor, Lambeua
(Stellan Skarsgĺrd). After a scuffle with some punks Will is thrown in
jail. Lambeaua offers to help Will out. Under the agreement that Will study
math with Lambeaua and that Will get some therapy.
After a few therapists, Will meets a therapist that has a drive to help
Will out. Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) is from the same part of town as
Will and is never turned away by Will's horrible behavior. The problem with
Will is that he has a lot of talent but he is squandering it away by being
a punk and turning down "real world" ideas. Both Lambeua and McGuire see
this and both want to help him out.
Along the way we get to see a relationship develop between Will and Skylar
(Minnie Driver). This relationship has meaning within the movie, but it
seems somewhat shallow, I would have liked to seen more of the relationship
develop during the film. We also get to meet Will's friends, including his
best friend, Chuckie (Ben Affleck). Again, like the relationship, the
friends in the film seem somewhat underdeveloped and shallow.
Those are small things though because the script works well in tugging and
pulling at our emotions. The biggest relationship developed is the one
between Will and Sean. And it is in this relationship that we find out how
Will became the way that he is. We also see how while Sean is helping Will,
Will is helping Sean.
All performances in Good Will Hunting are top-notch. Matt Damon is on a
roll, first with his big starring role in Francis Ford Coppola's The
Rainmaker, and now with his lead role in Good Will Hunting. I can't wait to
see what he's going to do next. Robin Williams also gives a wonderful
performance. His Professor McGuire is a man with a hard past and Williams
is able to get that across on screen. (I'm also glad to see Williams in a
good movie instead of movies like Flubber and Father's Day.)
The script by Damon and Affleck tries to milk each and every scene for
emotion, whether it is for a laugh or for a tear. And to that extent the
script works very well. Sometimes there is a corny feel to the script, but
that never gets bad enough to ruin the film. The direction by Gus Van Sant
Jr. does a wonderful job keeping the movie moving.
Worth mentioning is the score by Danny Elfman. The score is surprisingly
different from his other works. Elfman's score for Good Will Hunting is
very acoustic and intimate. But, like all his other scores, Elfman is able
to make it so that the score never overshadows what is happening on screen.
Good Will Hunting is a great film. The basis for the film is; if you have
talent don't waste it away. The film comes very close to being inspiring
and the film definitely is a tear-jerker. Don't Miss Good Will Hunting on
the big screen. After seeing the film, let me know what the title means to you.

Title
Review for Bean (1997)
Mr. Bean is an internationally known character, but like all
internationally known things he's not as well known here in the US. Sure,
he has been shown on PBS from time to time, but for most of us, who's Mr.
Bean? Mr. Bean is a clumsy bumbling soft mumbling man. The hilarious Rowan
Atkinson portrays him.
In Bean, Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a guard of some sort, though I could
be wrong because the position is unspecified, at the London National Art
Gallery. When a rich man in the US donates enough money to buy back the
Whistler's Mother from the London National Art Gallery, the US Grierson
Gallery requests that an expert accompany it to introduce it to the public.
What the Gallery gets is Mr. Bean. The curator of the Gallery (Peter
MacNicol) unknowingly volunteers to host Mr. Bean at his house, to the
dismay of his family and wife (Pamela Reed).
Rowan Atkinson is a great physical comedian who is funny but not annoying
(as with the case of Jim Carrey). The comedy bits in Bean are hilarious and
most of them had me laughing out loud. The problem was that there was too
much quiet time between the bits. Taking a TV show that's based on short
skits and stretching that out to a 90 minute feature film is a tough thing
to do. Though Bean comes close to pulling it off it fails in two ways.
The first is that there are, like I said, too many quiet moments between
the comedy bits. These expository moments put the movie into the real world
setting and this leads to the second reason why Bean fails. The Mr. Bean
character is a character that lives best in his own world. The things that
he does do not live too well in the real world, and by taking the Mr. Bean
character and sticking him in the real world, it takes a lot away from the
comedy. The most apparent place where the comedy just feels awful because
it's set in the real world is the hospital scene. If that had been done in
Mr. Bean's world, it would have been hilarious, but as it is in the film,
there is a kind of uneasy that follows the scene.
But, don't get me wrong, Bean is a funny funny movie that in parts almost
had me in tears laughing. These scenes include Bean in the restroom, Bean
at the park, and Bean with a turkey. Rowan Atkinson is perfect as Mr. Bean.
I would recommend seeing Bean during a matinee showing, it is good silly
fun that is somewhat flawed.

Title
Review for Apostle, The (1997)
The Apostle is a leisurely film.  It is leisurely in the way that it brings
us into the story.  It is leisurely in the way that it conveys to us the
story.  And it is leisurely in the way that it introduces us to the main
character, Euliss "Sonny" Dewey (Robert Duvall).
The Apostle is an independent film written by, directed by, and starring
Robert Duvall.  This film is Robert Duvall's labor of love.  The film opens
with an unforgettable shot: a swinging door and two pairs of legs-one of a
large African-American lady and the other of a young small white kid.  This
opening shot introduces us to Euliss Dewey and shows us how Euliss got
introduced to God.
So far this sounds like a typical Hollywood movie.  Will it take on the
typical against-the-church route?  Or will it take on the
super-religious-lets-convert-the-audience route?  Surprisingly, it takes
neither and this is what makes The Apostle so enjoyable.  The Apostle
focuses on Duvall's character.  His Sonny is not a flat movie character,
but is subtle and as human as the rest of us.  Duvall's script does not
falter when portraying Sonny.  Sonny always stays true to his humanity and
never slips off into the realm of just another movie preacher.
One night while on the road, Sonny sits in his bed.  He's thinking things
over and it dawns on him that his life is falling apart.  Another thing
dawns on him: his wife (Farrah Fawcett) is cheating on him.  So, he picks
up from the motel and drives back to town and finds his house empty.  He
then drives to the house of the new young preacher in his church and tosses
a baseball through his window.  Later the next day Sonny finds out that his
wife wants a divorce and to top that off she has secretly and legally
stolen his church from under him.  In a fit of rage, and under the
influence of alcohol, Sonny explodes and attacks his wife's new boyfriend
at a Little League game.  After this incident Sonny is forced to flee his
home state and change his name.  He takes up the name "The Apostle E.F."
E.F. travels for a while until he finds a small town and settles down to
start his new Pentecostal ministry.  E.F. needs some help though, and he
finds it in a retired preacher (John Beasley).  The church grows quickly
because of E.F.'s energetic revivals.  E.F. knows that he has done
something awful and he knows that he'll never escape from it.  So, he is
going to try as hard as he can to redeem himself and to help make people's
lives better.  He, and the audience, knows that he can do the latter, but
the former will eventually catch up with him.
Robert Duvall is one of the best actors alive and with The Apostle he shows
that he can do more than just act.  His performance in The Apostle is one
of his best yet.  But, it is his work behind the camera that is so amazing.
 His film relies not on camera tricks to bring us into the film; rather it
uses the characters to bring us in.  The film itself feels down to earth
without that slick Hollywood feel to it.  It's not the type of film that
makes you want to change yourself, like Good Will Hunting, but it makes you
think of what you can change about yourself.  Duvall's Apostle E.F. is an
unforgettable character.
Among the cast there are other performances worth mentioning.  Farrah
Fawcett gives a good performance as Apostle E.F.'s
angel-on-the-outside-but-sinner-within wife.  John Beasley gives a good
performance as the subtle preacher Blackwell.  Don't blink or you'll miss
Billy Bob Thorton's role as a racist ready to get rid of The Apostle E.F.'s
church.  And one of the most understated but memerable performances was by
Walt Goggins as Sam, the quiet young man who unconditionally accepts The
Apostle E.F. and helps him with the church.
The Apostle grows on you because of its leisurely pace.  In the first
half-hour things move a little slowly but stick with it; the reward is a
great character study.  What you don't get with The Apostle is standard
Hollywood fare.  This film is not embarrassed to do what it likes when it
likes.  The twists and turns in the film show up unexpectedly and the film
is not clichéd or predictable in any fashion.  Don't Miss The Apostle.
When the credits start to roll and the screen fades to black at the end,
don't pick up and leave; stay for a minute or so and see what makes the
character of Apostle E.F. so powerful and great. 

Title
Review for Money Talks (1997)
It's hard to review a movie like Money Talks. The movie to aim itself at a
mass audience, but the audience for the film is actually more limited. Not
because of its formula buddy/comedy/action script, but by its lead actor,
Chris Tucker.
The formula for Money Talks is pretty simplistic. A reporter (Charlie
Sheen) setups up a ticket scalper (Chris Tucker) to be arrested. After the
scalper is arrested, he escapes, but not before hearing about some super
secret lucrative dirty dealing. Now that the scalper has escaped, he goes
and finds the reporter who put him away. The scalper is now being hunted by
the cops because they thing he is a cop killer. His last chance? The
reporter maybe able to clear his name. The reporter who put him away feels
guilty and helps the scalper out. Along the way we run into really bad
guys, cops, and gangsters. Throw in a wedding, some stunts, and a few
comedic lines and you have the formula for Money Talks.
The limitation of this film is Chris Tucker. Tucker is a nasally voiced
fast talking cheap knock-off of Eddie Murphy. I think some will find it
hard to watch Tucker for more than five minutes. I've gotten used to him
after seeing him in The 5th Element, so he wasn't so bad. His annoying
screen presence though is what carries the film. His presence far
overshadows that of Charlie Sheen. Sheen gives a very bland performance in
this film, but it's probably expected by looking at Sheen's last few films.
The action is rather bland. Most of it consists of car chases and gun
fights. Director Brett Ratner shows that he is a rookie at shooting and
editing action. Most action sequences are chaotic, badly edited, and end up
losing the audience. The comedy of the film is much better than the action,
I found myself laughing out loud many times during the film.
Overall, Money Talks is a formula film that does entertain. While I
recommend this film, it is a weak recommendation, see it during a matinee
showing or on video. And keep in mind that Tucker is pretty obnoxious and
annoying, if you can't tolerate an actor like this, then this film is
definitely not for you. 

Title
Review for Corruptor, The (1999)
I was once asked if I biased my film reviews based on the presence of a
particular performer. Definitely! My admiration of Chow Yun-Fat comes from
his collaborations with legendary action director John Woo (Hard Boiled,
The Killer, Once A Thief). And like anyone who loves the work that these
two have accomplished in Hong Kong, I await the day that these two will
pair up again to do another film together. For now, I have to live with the
above par releases of Woo sans Chow (Face/Off) and the below par releases
of Chow sans Woo (The Replacement Killers). So, I was a little disappointed
by the film The Corruptor, a Chow release without Woo at the helm. The
Corruptor is an above average cop-buddy movie that is lifted up by the
presence of Chow Yun-Fat but then dragged down by Mark Wahlberg and
director James Foley.
Similar to The Replacement Killers, the title of The Corruptor does not
refer to the character portrayed by Chow Yun-Fat. Nick Chen (Chow Yun-Fat)
is a detective in the NYPD Asian Gangs Unit. The AGU is run by a tight knit
group of cops, all Chinese. A bombing at a local convenience store changes
all this. A new gang in town kills a foreigner and the mayor is screaming
to have the AGU expanded. And before you can scream "buddy-film", Mark
Wahlberg (Boogie Nights) shows up.
Chen who is on the take from a Chinatown businessman, Lee (Ric Young),
re-evaluates his beliefs and actions when he has to take on the new
recruit, Danny Wallace (Wahlberg). When Lee tries to put Wallace on the
payroll, this tests Chen's loyalties -- as the film progresses, Wallace is
also forced to take a close look at his loyalties through a great twist in
the story.
The script by first-time pen Robert Pucci has enough twists in it to keep
the attention of the moviegoer looking for a film filled with double-fisted
gunfights, because the action in The Corruptor is sparse. And when the
action fires up, it is done with such MTV style shooting and editing that I
was expecting to find a complimentary airsickness bag.
The one thing that I despise most about the current crop of action films is
the use of the "Shaky Camera" technique. This is a technique in which the
director and cinematographer (Juan Ruiz-Anchia) decide that action is
enhanced by bouncing the camera around. Put this together with quick cuts
and razor sharp editing and what you get are action sequences that no one
can follow. If you've seen the car chase in Michael Bay's The Rock and
thought the camerawork and editing in it was horrible, wait till you see
what James Foley can do with the car chase in The Corruptor. This car chase
had me dizzy. I don't understand why directors haven't learned that the
"Shaky Camera" technique does not heighten the tension in an action scene,
but detriments it.
The one thing that saves The Corruptor is Chow Yun-Fat. And though Foley
does not use Chow's talents to their full potential, there is enough of
Chow in the film to make it a worthwhile screening. In every way Chow is
the epitome of coolness. Whether he has two guns in hand pumping 50 rounds
into a bad guy or just standing around talking to another cop: he is cool.
In The Replacement Killers, Chow was held back by his weak understanding of
English. In that film, his US premiere film, he was stoic and boring -- but
still cool. In The Corruptor, his English is much better -- by leaps and
bounds -- and he is freed to do what he does best: Act. In The Corruptor,
Chow is freed to show off his onscreen charm. His low-key humor shines
onscreen and that makes the film all the more better.
What drags down Chow is Wahlberg. Wahlberg tries to underplay his part,
playing his Wallace more like his character in Boogie Nights than a real
cop. The problem was that I never accepted Wahlberg as a cop. His
performance in The Corruptor was horrible. Wahlberg adds nothing to this
film except for some bare-chested scenes that are guaranteed to bring in
the female audience.
Director James Foley tries his best at putting together an action film, but
fails.  The action in The Corruptor lacks excitement and tension, it is
flat as can be. More often it's just a series of images flashed onscreen
with loud noises. Foley is able to keep the story moving, but unfortunately
he is unprepared for doing the action portion of the film.
I'm convinced that had two small changes been made to The Corruptor, it
would have come out a much better and more highly enjoyable film. The
changes would be the replacement of director James Foley with John Woo and
the recasting of Danny Wallace with a stronger actor than Mark Wahlberg. As
it stands, The Corruptor is still a Don't Miss film, but only because of
Chow Yun-Fat's presence in the film. See The Corruptor for Chow Yun-Fat.

Review for Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997)
Director Jan De Bont has yet to have a strong script to work with. Look at 
Twister and Speed. But what he's had going for him is a sense of fun in 
directing. Speed was not well received by critics, but the audience thought 
different, and the movie became an instant summer hit. This was rightfully so, 
Speed was a joyride and it was fun. Twister experienced the same from the 
critics and the audience. But Twister was not as fun as Speed, the main 
attraction there was its special effects. Speed 2 has begun to receive the 
warm reviews from the critics and how it will be received by the audience is 
still up in the air. For me though, Speed 2 is just like its older siblings, a 
fun movie that is a joyride and has some spectacular special effects to be 
seen.
Annie (Sandra Bullock) and her new boyfriend Alex (Jason Patrick) are at a 
standpoint in their relationship. She's also not too happy about him being on 
"the suicide squad." He has the perfect plan though, a cruise. Geiger (Willem 
Dafoe) is a disgruntled ex-employee on the cruise also. Geiger has planted 
bombs all over the ship and is ready to sink it. But, why would he want to go 
through all this trouble to sink a ship? You'll have to see the film to find 
that out, he actually has two reasons for sinking the ship. Alex, being the 
tough guy he is, stays behind with some trapped cruise-goers to stop the 
madman. Annie stays to try to help Alex out.
How much can happen on a cruise boat? A lot more than can happen on a bus. 
There are fights with fires, fights with a 12-foot propeller, fun with 
grenades, fun on lifeboats, and even an elevator scene.
Sandra Bullock is still as likeable as she was in the original. I was 
pleasantly surprised with Jason Patrick's performance. His character was 
higher likeable and he did an excellent job at playing Alex. Willem Dafoe 
gives a mixed performance as Geiger. Although he is a sick crazed man, his 
character swings too much. Sometimes seeming very intelligent and other times 
acting like an idiot nuthouse.
The action sequences work really well, though they could have been better. I 
often wondered when watching the action sequences, "Who substituted the home 
hand held cam for the real camera?" The cinematographer, Jack Green, used some 
very shaky shots during the action sequences. And instead of showing how much 
chaos is really in the scene, it serves only to frustrate the viewer. The 
opening motorcycle sequence was a little contrived and had a TV feel to it. 
But after that, the action gets up to speed and is of a higher caliber. I 
enjoyed most the propeller sequence and the Cruise vs. Oil Tanker sequence.
The sound in Speed 2 is worth mentioning. The sound is incredible and should 
be seen in a DTS equipped theatre.
Speed 2 is an action movie and makes no other efforts, and that is what makes 
it so enjoyable. If you got a fancy for some tense action then go see Speed 2. 
This film is fun.

Review for Full Monty, The (1997)
I've love movies that leave me with a silly grin when I step out of a
theatre. The Full Monty is just that kind of movie.
Two men in Sheffield, England are down and out. They are out of their job
at a local steel mill and just wander around. They spend their extra time
steeling steel bars and hanging out at the local job-hunting office. Also
at the job-hunting office is their former foreman. One day Chippendales
visits their town and all the local women are there. One of the down and
out men, Gaz, gets an idea. They could make a bundle of money if they did
the same thing as the Chippendale men, except taking it all off. Going for
"The Full Monty."
The two men seek out the help of their former foreman, who knows how to
dance. Then they go looking for other men. They put together a group of
six, them included, of a strange mix. One guy is extremely good looking,
but can't dance (watch as he does the "wall walking" dance). Another is
overweight and thinks that his wife is cheating on him. Another can dance,
but has a bad hip and is a bit old. The there is the guy whose wife is
using the credit card to the max but does not know that her husband has
been out of a job for over six months. All of them have their troubles and
this makes for a hilarious rag tag group of men.
The movie follows Gaz (Robert Carlyle) most of the time. He has been out of
his job, lost his wife, and now a court is saying that he cannot see his
son because he hasn't paid his child support. His son is hesitant of
staying at his place because he can't afford heating.
The Full Monty is a great mix of comedy and a bit of drama. The striptease
act is erotic at all, unlike the recent bad attempts by Striptease and
Showgirls, The Full Monty throws out eroticism and puts in comedy.
Worth mentioning is the beautiful cinematography by John de Borman. He
captures the beauty of the countryside and the gritty looks of the city.
Also worth mentioning is the upbeat score by Anne Dudley.
Since this was a film from England, I had a hard time at the beginning and
sometimes during the film, understanding what they were saying on screen.
Though later on in the film the accents sunk in.
The Full Monty is a hilarious film with a good mix of comedy and drama. I
highly recommend this film. Don't miss this one in the theatres. You just
might find yourself walking out of the theatre will a silly smile on your
face.

Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
Someone give a pat on the back to Drew Barrymore's agent.  This agent has
literally erased the bad girl image of Barrymore with the last few films
she has done.  And with Never Been Kissed it's not any different, Barrymore
is just so lovable in this film.
Never Been Kissed is not a plausible film by any means: A 25 year old copy
editor from the Chicago Sun Times, who has never really been kissed, is
sent back to high school to do an undercover story about high school life
in the 90s.  But, this implausibility is instantly lost as we meet Josie
(Barrymore) Gellar, the copy who is going to be sent on the assignment.
Barrymore is so cute and huggable in this film that we instantly relate to her.
Josie is, at first, ecstatic about the undercover assignment  it marks her
first writing assignment for the Sun Times.  But, as her brother Rob (David
Arquette) reminds her of the things that she went through her first time in
high school she starts to withdraw from the idea of going back a second
time.   Josie was a loser in high school, known as `Josie Grossie', and it
takes a bit of pep talking from Rob to get her to go back to high school.
As Josie starts high school again she meets a very attractive English
teacher, Sam, and this establishes the romantic part of this romantic comedy.
At the heart of Never Been Kissed is a story of finding oneself and second
chances.  We see this theme in Josie's story, but also in Rob's.  The story
is heartwarming and funny and will definitely appeal to many  especially
those who are currently in high school or about to enter high school.  This
is a film that falls squarely in the crowd-pleaser category and it succeeds
wildly at this.
Barrymore is so sweet in Never Been Kissed that it's hard to criticize her
performance.  Her performance is just fine in Never Been Kissed  though
sometimes a bit hokey, like early on in the film where she describes how
she's never really been kissed.  The performance that I liked the most is
David Arquette's.  Arquette gives an energetic performance as Josie's loser
brother who dreams of playing baseball in the majors.
Don't Miss Never Been Kissed in the theatres.  This is a film that will
make you all warm and fuzzy by the end of the film.  This film will also
have you leaving the theatre with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes.

Review for Seven Years in Tibet (1997)
I'll start out by saying Seven Years in Tibet is one of the best looking
films of this year. Seven Years in Tibet and the recent The Matchmaker
(starring Janeane Garafalo) are on the top of my list as great looking
films of 1997. Cinematographer, Robert Fraisse, should be noted for the
beautifully shot Seven Years in Tibet.
Seven Years in Tibet is based on the autobiographical book by the same
name, written by Heinrich Herrer. Though the previews seem to give the
sense that the movie follows the friendship between Herrer and the Dalai
Lama, that only happens during the last half of the film. As the film
starts we learn that, the Austrian, Herrer (Brad Pitt) is invited by the
Nazi government to be part of an expedition to climb the Nanga Parbat, one
of the tallest mountains in the Himalayas. With his leaving for the
expedition he leaves behind his pregnant wife. Herrer befriends the leader
of the expedition, Peter Aufschnaiter (David Thewlis), the friendship is
built through their many hardships together.
The expedition comes to a halt and the team goes back down the mountain to
find that they are being detained as prisoners of war. Herrer tries many
times to escape the prison, but is unsuccessful. He finally escapes with
the help of Aufschnaiter and they trek through the mountains of India to
arrive at the Tibetan holy city Lhasa. The residents quickly accept them,
which is not an easy thing because foreigners at the time were looked upon
badly. It is here that Herrer befriends the Dalai Lama who is portrayed by
newcomer Jamyang Wangchuk.
The best performance in Seven Years is by the newcomer Jamyang Wangchuk.
His performance as the Dalai Lama is absolutely excellent. Pitt does not
fare so well though. He doesn't do badly in the film, but his performance
was mediocre at best. One big flaw was his disappearing and reappearing
accent. Thewlis does well as Aufschnaiter; the last time I saw Thewlis was
in Dragon Heart where he portrayed a wimpy prince.
Worth mentioning is the score by John Williams. Though not one of his
stronger scores, it is a good score to the film. Also worth mentioning are
the beautiful set design by At Hoang and costume design by Enrico Sabatini.
 But, again, the biggest thing going for Seven Years is the cinematography
by Fraisse.
The movie does run a bit long; the analogy that I would put for the film is
"a long long drive through a beautiful place." Director Jean-Jacques Annaud
and screenwriter Becky Johnson seem to add the last quarter of the film to
lengthen it a bit, which, though very informative about what the Chinese
did to the Tibetans, causes the audience to lose focus on the story of
Herrer. The film is a redemption story about Herrer, who starts out as an
arrogant self-righteous man, but in the end learns his wrongs and changes.
Seven Years in Tibet is a long film that is entertaining and informative. I
enjoyed the cinematography the most in this film. Jamyang Wangchuk is the
real star of the film and this film should be seen for his performance.

Review for Cop Land (1997)
Sylvester Stallone acts? Ha! At least that's what I thought walking into
the showing of Cop Land. Did I walk out thinking different?
Across the bridge in New Jersey there is a town named Garrison. It's a
small town, mostly populated by cops from New York. The sheriff of Garrison
is Freddy Heflin (Sylvester Stallone). He has a desperate want to be in the
NYPD, but can't get in because of one deaf ear. The town of Garrison is
populated mostly by cops, most of them dirty.
Writer/Director James Mangold tries to write a multileveled story, spinning
up many plot threads. He includes the main plot of a super-boy cop who
shoots two death two black men on the bridge. Then there are the
miscellaneous personal stories that link different cops. One cop is
sleeping with another's wife. Another is doing drugs and does something
horrible to his girlfriend. One bigger thread is about a dirty cop who sets
up the town with the help of the mob. Moe Tilden (Robert De Niro) heads up
an Internal Affair's investigation of that dirty cop. There is also a love
interest for Stallone. There are a few other threads, but they are mostly
extraneous ones. Most of these threads get cut short and end up being
shallow. Many of the threads are unneeded.
The film seems to become bloated after a while. Many big name stars step
into the film, including Harvey Keitel, Robert De Niro, and Ray Lolita.
(Off subject, De Niro's character seemed to have been stuck in the late 70s
or early 80s, his hair is awful, and he's dressed badly). I was happy to
see Janeane Garofalo again. Her screen time is little and her part was
completely unnecessary, but it was nice to see her again on the big screen.
Cop Land tries really hard to be a high drama film and though it comes
close, it fails. Cop Land is a wait for video movie, and even then, I
cannot recommend it. And for those of you wondering, yes, Stallone can act,
and he does well in Cop Land. Stallone just needs to find a project with a
better script next time.

Review for Boot, Das (1981)
Many movies use a submarine as a setting to confine characters in order to
drive a movie, such as Crimson Tide and The Hunt for Red October. But, most
of these films never use the actual life aboard a submarine as the story.
These films use a larger point of view as the story - in Crimson Tide it
was about a nuclear attack, and in The Hunt for Red October it was about a
defecting skipper. Das Boot is a movie that shows us just how grueling life
was aboard a U-boat in World War II.
Wolfgang Petersen made the brilliant Das Boot before he made In the Line of
Fire, Outbreak, and Air Force One. His last three films are mediocre, all
of them falling in the stock action films department. I enjoyed them all,
but any director could have done them. I did not know Petersen's full
potential till I saw his first big hit, Das Boot.
Das Boot takes place about a German U-boat. This is where the film really
shines. Because it's a German U-boat in the middle of World War II, the
audience is not about to cheer for the crew. We are left gripped by the
story and their mission, instead of the hurrah of the "American Navy going
out and kicking enemy butt." 
Das Boot follows a reporter (Herbert Grönemeyer) who goes on a tour of duty
with a U-boat. The U-boat is captained by a man only known as Captain
(Jürgen Prochnow). Though the captain is the eldest and strongest of all
the men aboard the U-boat, he is only in his mid-thirties. He is serving on
a boat full of young men, all of whom need strong leadership. The Captain
is the source of the leadership.
The Captain is not a real supporter of Hitler or the Nazis. He's just doing
his job. This is shown early on in the film.
Das Boot goes one step further; it shows us what life is like on a tin can
like the U-boat. The U-boat is truly a tin can - its dimensions barely
wider than a man with his arms outstretched and its height almost as tall
as a man. Das Boot goes to show that a submariner's life during a war is
truly 90% sheer boredom and 10% pure terror. We experience life at the pace
that the crew does - slow as molasses and repetitive, or quiet and
sweat-filled as the boat lays dormant trying to avoid depth charges. 
Petersen and cinematographer Jost Vacano chose an ingenious way of
conveying the cramped conditions of a U-boat to the audience by shooting
the whole movie from within a real replica of a U-boat. This meant shooting
with a specially designed camera that could be used to follow crewmembers
from one end of the U-boat to the other. This makes for a movie that looks
and feels cramped.
There are moments in Das Boot that will make you sweat with the sailors.
The attack on a convoy is one. After the attack, destroyers criss-cross the
ocean above hunting the hunter. The terror from this moment comes not from
what we see but from what we hear the bolts popping, the slight creak, the
groan of the boat, and the hum of a near silent engine. Another moment
comes when the ship is sinking - again it's the sound that conveys the
terror, not the sights.
The version that I watched is the director's cut of the film, which spans
about 60 minutes more than the original cut. This puts the running time at
about three and a half hours. I have not seen the original cut, so I cannot
tell you what the differences are. The sound in this version has also been
digitally redone from the top down. And I congratulate the sound editing
team for putting together a wonderful soundtrack to the film.
A few weeks ago, I saw Saving Private Ryan, which I thought was a great
anti-war movie. Das Boot is of the same stature of Saving Private Ryan. It
is a movie of both technical brilliance and of great storytelling. And in
the end we are left wondering, why do humans fight wars? Don't Miss Das Boot.
Das Boot is available on videocassette and DVD. The video cassette version
is a subtitled version. The DVD version - which I viewed for this review -
contains both English dubbed, Spanish dubbed, and a German soundtrack. The
DVD version also has Spanish, French, and English subtitles.

Review for Forces of Nature (1999)
Forces of Nature is a film that I fell in love with from the very start.
This film has a sort of charm and style that immediately drew me in, and as
the film moved on, it showed that it doesn't just rely on charm and style
to keep me loving it.
Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) is a guy who writes the blurbs on the inside of
book jackets. He and his fiancée Bridget (Maura Tierney) live in New York,
but have decided to have their wedding in Savannah. Bridget leaves early
for Savannah, while Ben stays behind in New York for a day because of some
family complications. Ben, who has a fear of flying, gets unwittingly onto
a plane that will take him to Savannah.  But, as the plane is about to
take-off, it crashes. Stuck with no way to get to Savannah, in comes Sarah
(Sandra Bullock) who has struck a deal with a guy named Vic to get to
Savannah in a small rented car. As you might have guessed, this is only the
beginning of Ben and Sarah's adventures.
Along the way to Savannah, Ben and Sarah find different modes of
transportation. And everything that could go wrong, does go wrong. They
encounter fires, rain, hail, and anything else that nature can throw at
them. During all of these happenings Ben starts to look at why he is
getting married to Bridget. He wonders if he truly loves Bridget or if he
is really in love with the free spirited Sarah. The story doesn't all
pertain to Ben though; there is a subplot with Bridget and an old
boyfriend. And Sarah is not as big of a free spirit as she initially leads
us to believe.
Though a movie can throw gobs of charm and style at an audience, it only
carries a film so far. And the director, Bronwen Hughes, and writer, Marc
Lawrence, know exactly this. So, although Forces of Nature is full of charm
and style, both Ben and Sarah are also fully fleshed out three-dimensional
characters that we can relate to and care about. It also helps that Affleck
and Bullock have a tangible onscreen chemistry. On top of that Affleck and
Tierney also have that same tangible onscreen chemistry. So, as the film
goes on we know that someone is going to get hurt, but we don't want anyone
to. And throughout the film we are wondering whom Ben will eventually end
up with.
Forces of Nature could have ended up as a mediocre film that is a lump of
different other films.  But, a smart script, strong performances, and a
wonderful sense of style keep the film from that. All through the film
there is a sense that the filmmakers know exactly what they want and how
they want it to turn out, and this helps the film immensely.
Affleck, who hasn't really had a lead role in his career, shows that he is
lead-role material. He also shows that he is not a one-hit-wonder.
Following his brilliant performance in Chasing Amy, his Academy Award for
Good Will Hunting, his small and hilarious role in Shakespeare in Love, and
his huge presence in last summer's Armageddon, Forces of Nature is a film
that shows that Affleck is here to stay. Kudos to Affleck for a wonderful
performance in Forces of Nature.
Bullock, who shot to stardom in Speed and then had a string of miserable
failures (Practical Magic and Hope Floats being the latest), comes back
with guns blazing. She is able to recapture that girl-next-door persona
that we all fell in love with in the film Speed. Kudos to Bullock for a
wonderful performance in Forces of Nature.
Though not something that I would have expected from a romantic-comedy, the
special effects in Forces of Nature are superb. They are subtle enough not
to completely take us out of the film, but stunning enough to make us
notice. There are two standout squences: The rain/hail sequence early on in
the film and the hurricane/party sequence towards the end of the film. I
especially loved the rain/hail sequence.
>From the get-go I knew Forces of Nature was a Don't Miss film. There's just
nothing to hate about this film and everything to love. Don't Miss Forces
of Nature on the big screen. This is a wonderful romantic comedy.

Review for 6th Day, The (2000)
Let me first say that The 6th Day is better than Arnie's last film End of 
Days.  But, that's not saying too much since End of Days was so 
terrible.  We are entering in to the era of neo-Arnie  a softer and gentler 
Arnie who makes movies that are no longer rated R, but are rated 
PG-13.  The 6th Day has one huge failing and is rescued by one great 
idea.  More on this later.
In The 6th Day we follow the life of ordinary guy Adam Gibson (Arnold 
Schwarzenegger).  He's a helicopter pilot with a pretty ordinary life with 
a wife, daughter, and even a cute dog.  On his birthday he decides to 
switch off a job with his work partner Hank.  Hank is killed during the job 
and Adam comes home to find someone who looks interestingly just like 
him  this person is living in his house, acting like him, playing with his 
child, and even having sex with his wife.  Well, in any other movie a 
mind-over-anger approach would have taken place.  But, come on!  This is an 
Arnie film and all hell breaks loose, as there are two Arnies on screen.
In the near future  and we're told the not so far away future by the 
opening titles  cloning of pets has been perfected and though humans have 
been cloned, it is outlawed.  The master-cloning doctor is a brilliant man 
named Dr. Weir (Robert Duvall) and he has a scheming business partner named 
Drucker (Tony Goldwyn).  Well, like in real life, laws are made to be 
broken and Adam has been cloned and now that there are two of them in the 
world, one of them has to be eliminated to eliminate the evidence of 
illegal cloning.
The story for The 6th Day is not deep, this is an action film, but the 
issues brought up in the film are great!  The cloning process basically 
reproduces an exact clone of a person within two hours.  What does this 
mean really?  It means that a person can live forever.  A snapshot of a 
person's mind at a moment of time (called a "syncording") and a sample of 
the person's DNA is all that is needed to create a perfect clone.  This 
clone doesn't even know that he is a clone.  The issue of cloning is quite 
real in today's world and the film does bring up some of these interesting 
issues.  It is because of this that the film survives, it is able to infuse 
enough action to please the audience and also put in something for the 
audience to think about after the film.
Where the film fails, but not failing hard enough for me to not like the 
film, is in its tone and setting.  See, the opening titles try to scare us 
by saying that what we are going to see is the near future.  But, it goes 
on specifically to let us know that this is not too far away from now.  And 
if the film had stuck to this then it would have been a brilliant 
film  what I mean is if the film had put the characters in a world that is 
not far different than our world right now, it would have helped put the 
audience closer to what is happening on screen and what is at the core of 
the film, the question of cloning.  What director Roger Spottiswoode 
("Tomorrow Never Dies") does though is tell us one thing and then show us 
another  he puts us in a world where helicopters can transform into jet 
planes, where instead of ammo firing guns there are laser guns, and 
holographic displays for football games.  With these things he's just put 
us not in the near future, but way "out there".  And but doing that the 
points and issues brought up by the film do not him home well enough.  Also 
the suspension of disbelief is now greater since we now have to believe 
that cloning technology is perfected to the point where a human can be 
cloned in two hours plus that there are helicopters that can turn into jet 
planes and that there are laser guns.  I think Spottiswoode seriously 
dropped the ball here.  He should have said that it was in the not so 
distant future then set it up just like that, it would have made the film's 
depiction of the cloning much more frightening.
Lets not forget though that this is an action film and there is action in 
the film.  Like Spottiswoode previous action film Tomorrow Never Dies, the 
action is pretty flat in this film.  Spottiswoode does not know how to do 
action well.  The action is flat and at times yawn inducing.  A car chase 
is shot early on in the film and that was a dud.  The laser gun fights 
were, well, laser gun fights that looked as exciting as some cutting room 
floor stuff from the original Star Wars film.  It's enough action to carry 
the film along, but it sure isn't exciting enough to carry the film by 
itself  thank goodness for the good core ideas about cloning.
The actors seem to do what they can with the film.  Arnie is Arnie.  This 
isn't one of his best performances.  It also isn't one of his worst.  He is 
serviceable and likeable on screen.  I wish Arnie would return to the 
classic style Arnie and make movies like T2, Total Recall, or even 
something like Predator.  Neo-Arnie is a little too soft for my 
tastes.  Worth mentioning is actress Sara Wynter as Talia.  Talia is one of 
the agents working for Drucker's corporation trying to eliminate 
Adam.  Wynter is does pretty well with her part and it was always 
entertaining to see her on screen.
The 6th Day is an average movie that eludes my recommendation for a big 
screen showing at full price.  But, if you see it at a cheap matinee or on 
video it will be a decent flick to see.  The ideas brought up about cloning 
are good conversation items and it is nice to see Arnie back on the screen 
doing something better than that hellacious (pun intended) End of Days.

Review for Outbreak (1995)
Humans might be on top of the food chain, but Outbreak shows just how weak
we are up here. The scary thing is that realistically we won't be wiped out
by something bigger and larger, but by something so small that we need a
microscope to see it. Outbreak brings up the scary, but frighteningly
realistic, premise that a virus, not unlike the Ebola Zaire virus, could
wipe us out with in days.
Outbreak starts about thirty years ago in Africa, where an Ebola-like virus
Motaba has almost wiped out an entire village. The doctors and survivors
are told that they will be getting medical supplies soon and they cheer as
a plane flies overhead and drops a package. They find out all too late that
the package contains not medical supplies but something to wipe out the
Motaba virus.
The U.S. Government believes that the virus has been wiped out until in
present day it shows up again. An illegally shipped monkey infects one guy
and director Wolfgang (Air Force One) Peterson uses an unusually
entertaining (though very frightening) way of showing how the virus is
passed along. Outbreak follows Col. Daniels (Dustin Hoffman) who is a
specialist with viruses. He's just getting over a divorce with Robby (Renee
Russo), whom he used to work together with, but she is now going off to
Atlanta to work with the Center of Disease Control.
Daniels is sent to Africa to check out the outbreak and it looks pretty
serious. But, his officials, General McClintock (Donald Sutherland) and
General Ford (Morgan Freeman), doubt that the outbreak can reach America.
That is until a whole town is infected and dying. Daniels along with his
team of specialists, his ex-wife, and a whole lot of Army grunts quarantine
off the town and try to find out how to cure all these people.
While Daniels is trying to find the cure, McClintock devises a way to try
to firebomb the town to get rid of the virus.
Director Wolfgang Peterson has a good eye with the camera. He has many long
continuous shots that are quite interesting to watch. One of these
interesting shots follows the path of a flying virus, which is absolutely
amazing and frightening, when you see it. Peterson knows his timing also;
he keeps the film moving along at a good pack, never really stopping to
take a breath. And as far as action goes, he knows how to do that also.
Outbreak seems to have two distinct parts to it. The first part is a
chilling techno-thriller. This first hour is very interesting and
informative showing how the virus can be passed on, how the virus ravages
the human body, and how it eventually kills a human. The second hour is
more of an action film. This hour includes a thrilling helicopter chase, a
race against the clock to find "the host", and playing chicken with a C-130.
Though I thoroughly enjoyed both parts of the film, I would have like to
have seen the film follow through intelligently with the first half of the
film without having to go to the race against the clock formula.
Worth mentioning, next to the two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Renee Russo, is
Cuba Gooding Jr. Though he has a stock character, as Major Salt, he does
all he can with it, and is one of the most memorable characters in the film.
There are some minor annoyances with Outbreak. One would be the thin
subplot about Hoffman's Col. Daniels and Russo's Robby. Though it's an OK
subplot to have in there, it wasn't quite necessary. The action ending, as
mentioned before, feels somewhat tacked on. It is exciting though, but
there could have been a more intelligent way to end the film.
Outbreak is a thrilling film that for the first hour uses its intellect to
thrill you, then in the second hour it uses its adrenaline rush action to
thrill you. Outbreak is an overall fun film to see, so don't miss this movie. 

Title
Review for Copycat (1995)
I'll start this review with the end on the review.  CopyCat is a tense,
scary, and intelligent thriller that everyone has to see.
The difference between CopyCat and most other thrillers is that the two
leads are both intelligent women.  It's not a cheap thriller where the
muscle-bound gun toting man comes and rescues the screaming ditsy blonde
from the bad guy.  It treats the audience as smart people and slowly builds
us up to a strange, but satisfying, ending.
Sigourney Weaver plays Helen Hudson, a crime analyst and author haunted by
an attempt on her life by a serial killer.  She has not left the house in
over a year.  She knows her serial killers.  Holly Hunter plays a cop, Mary
Jane Monahan, who is working her first serial case.  She tracks down
Weaver's character, Hudson, after Hudson calls the precinct to give clues
to the serial murders.  Mary Jane wants Hudson to help out with the case
because of her familiarity with serial killers.
The story follows the case of the serial killer who is copying the styles
of different serial killers in history.  And the final victim seems to be
Hudson herself.
Harry Connick Jr. has a short but important part in CopyCat.  He gives a
very creepy performance.  Holly Hunter gives the best performance as Mary
Jane.  Weaver is good, but not as good as Hunter.
Worth mentioning is the musical score by Christopher Young which gives a
eerie mood to the film.  Jon Amiel does a good job at keeping the movie's
pace quick and keepinig the tension high.
To end this review I'll ask, do you remember the beginning?

Title
Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
For the last two weeks, on the drive to work, I passed a Snake Eyes
billboard. There's a large picture of Nicolas Cage and in big letters below
"Cage Snake Eyes." That is some good advice from a studio trying to promote
this film.
Detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) is a guy who is loud and obnoxious.
He's a guy who wants everyone's attention, and during the rainy night in
Snake Eyes, he'll get it. Santoro is attending a big boxing match at a
large Atlantic City casino with his longtime friend Major Kevin Dunn (Gary
Sinise). Dunn is there providing protective services for the Secretary of
Defense.
During the fight, the Secretary is assassinated. All hell breaks loose and
Santoro heads up the investigation, finding that there might be a
conspiracy. He spends his time chasing after a woman in a blonde wig and
another woman in a red wig. He thinks that there are others involved in the
conspiracy, and since this is Hollywood, he's right.
If you understood the conspiracy in Mission: Impossible, you will probably
understand the conspiracy in Snake Eyes. I didn't even bother with trying
to understand why the Secretary was killed; I just looked at the wonderful
camera work by cinematographer Stephen H. Burum.
After being engrossed by the whodunit of last week's The Negotiator, I was
disappointed that the head of the conspiracy is revealed so quickly in
Snake Eyes. Writer David Koepp (Men in Black, Lost World, Mission:
Impossible) pens the film in an inventive manner, but the weak point of the
script remains; we get to find out who the bad guy is too quickly. 
But that is not the weakest point of the film; it has one of the worst
endings I've ever seen. It is plain awful and so unbelievable that I felt
cheated after sitting in the theatre for two hours.
However, the first 90 minutes of Snake Eyes is very interesting. The way
that DePalma shows us the story from different points of view is
entertaining. Just keep in mind that one of these points of view is that of
the killer and is the wrench thrown into the well-oiled machine -- a view
point that serves only to confuse an already confused audience.
DePalma also shows off with Snake Eyes. Some of the camera movements,
angles, and setups in Snake Eyes are beyond belief. This includes the long
opening sequence. The sequence follows Nicolas Cage for about 15 minutes
and seems to be uncut, though there might be one or two cuts during some
swish-pans. This opening left me saying, "Wow, now that was cool!" Snake
Eyes should be a film shown during cinematography classes; there are quite
a few setups that make for good studying.
As for acting, no one does anything new. Nicolas Cage revives his Castor
Troy from Face/Off and melts in some of his Cameron Poe from Con Air for
his part as Rick Santoro. He's loud, brash, and too over-the-top to be
enjoyable. His character has a sudden attack of conscience during the film
that doesn't ring true. The other lead actor, Gary Sinise, has played this
type of part enough to be typecast. Sinise is awful in Snake Eyes; he needs
to find a different type of role to play.
Snake Eyes is the worst of bad movies it starts off really well, builds up
a lot of good story, then hits you with an improbable and laughable ending.
Skip Snake Eyes in the theatres. As the billboard says, the movie Snake
Eyes should be caged. No one needs this kind of disappointment. I wonder
who let it out of the cage.

Title
Review for Fallen (1998)
Fallen is a crash of genres. It takes a detective/sleuth genre and smashes
it together with a thriller/supernatural genre. Typically, smashing genres
together, especially such different genres, doesn't work really well. How
well does it work with Fallen?
The movie starts off with the calm voice of Detective Hobbes (Denzel
Washington) recounting a story for us, "I want to tell you about the time I
almost died." And from here we are transported back in time to the start of
the events that Hobbes is referring to.
Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) is about to go to the gas chamber. But, before
he does, he gets a visit from the detective that caught him and sent him to
the chamber, Detective John Hobbes. As Reese is sent off to the gas
chamber, he starts to sing a song, that is used very well throughout the
film, "Time is on my side"
What happens next is the supernatural part, it seems that Reese was the
embodiment of a fallen angel, Azazel. Now that Reese has been gassed to
death, he's pretty angry and wants to get some payback. It seems that
Azazel travels from body to body via touch. Azazel doesn't want to kill
Hobbes right away, he wants to play with Hobbes and ruin his life first.
Hobbes is quickly alerted to Azazel's presence, by Azazel in different
people. But, Hobbes is confused to how -- as he believes -- Reese is doing
what he's doing, since he believes that Reese is dead. For Hobbes and his
partner Jonesy (John Goodman) the problem is to find out what is happening
and how it is happening. In his detective work, Hobbes runs into Gretta
Milano, the daughter of a cop who killed himself 30 some years ago. There
is a link between Milano's dad and what is happening to Hobbes. She tells
Hobbes about Azazel and helps him out.
Fallen is a well-written film by Nicolas Kazan. It does well with the
mixing of the genres and plays somewhat like a longer episode of The
known -- Primal Fear, does an excellent job of bringing the audience into
the film without a sudden onslaught of supernaturalism. Hoblit is able to
ease us slowly into the supernatural portion of the film because the script
has Hobbes as an unbeliever and the audience is slowly brought to the point
of suspension of disbelief as we follow Hobbes' own trip into the
supernatural. The film itself looks beautiful with its washed out colors
and high contrast cinematography. Kudos to cinematographer Tom Sigel. The
film looks almost like a David Fincher film -- it would have been fun to
see how the film would have turned out if Fincher had directed it.
Look for Elias Koteas' eerie performance as Reese early on in the film. He
is convincingly creepy as a serial killer taken over by a demon.
Washington, like always, is great onscreen. He has a commanding onscreen
presence. And though John Goodman has a supporting role, he takes the role
all the way and is a joy to see onscreen.
Worth mentioning is a chase sequence in the middle of the film between
Azazel and Gretta that is pretty exciting and will cause you to scoot to
the edge of your seat. This chase sequence is ingenious and if I say
anything more, it'll spoil the chase for you.
The end of the film has a big twist and for me it was a well-deserved
twist, but I'm afraid that it is so big that some audience members might be
disappointed. Kudos to Hoblit for keeping such a twist in the film.
The music by Tan Dun is strange, creepy, and works really well with the
film. The score is filled with high strings and is somewhat hard to
describe, but it does work really well.
The only thing that bothered me about the film was its running time. It
doesn't excessively run too long, but it does feel a bit on the long side.
The film could have benefited from a few cuts to tighten it up. But, this
is not a big deal.
Fallen works very well as a film that smashes two very different genres
together. The last film that did this was Devil's Advocate. Though Devil's
Advocate works a bit better than Fallen, Fallen is a great film to spend
two hours with. If you have time, catch Fallen in the theatres. If not,
catch it on video.

Review for Trois couleurs: Rouge (1994)
Why can't more movies be as perfect as Red?
It's hard to find a movie as intriguing, fun, and engrossing as Red.  Red
is the third and final installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors
Trilogy.  The first two in the trilogy were Blue and White.  Red can be
seen as complete without any knowledge of the previous two movies.
The movie follows the life of a Swiss model, Valentine (Irene Jacob), who's
living in Geneva.  She is trying to keep a long distance relationship with
her boyfriend in England.  One night while driving home, Valentine hit a
dog.  She tried to return the dog to its owner, a reclusive retired judge
(Jean-Louis Trintignant), known only as The Judge, who spies on his
neighbours' cordless telephone calls.  We are then introduced to another
minor story that follows Auguste (a newly graduated law student) and his
love, Karin.  But, is this really a minor part of the story?
What drives Red is not the zigzagging plot or the well developed
characters, rather the mysteries and questions that arise during the film.
Who is the man who refers to himself as The Judge?  Who is Auguste and why
is he so important to what's happening?  What does Valentine see in The
Judge?  Will Valentine ever meet Auguste?  These questions drew me into the
film.  I wanted to know more; my curiosity was piqued. The beauty of Red is
that it is able to hold our attentions without guns, car chases, or
explosions.  Red is a well-written novel, whereas a typical American movie
with heroes, guns, car chases, and explosions looks like a comic book.
Red is a film about coincidence and fate.  Red is a film about how these
two things -- coincidence and fate -- mold our lives and how we don't even
realize it.  Watch for different things that Kieslowski uses to show this.
My favourite is the intersection where after Valentine makes a turn in her
car to go home, in front of a massive billboard where her gum advertisement
will be hanging right before Auguste crosses the street.  Later in the
film, we see Auguste stop at the same light in front of the gum
advertisement and pause a second to smile at the ad.  Instantly questions
arise.  These two have never met, but will they?  Will fate bring them
together?  Or will fate make them diverge?  There is the coincidence in
which Valentine runs over -- but doesn't kill -- The Judge's dog.  This
event brings Valentine to The Judge's house and this brings up even more
questions about their platonic relationship.
I got Red on laserdisc for two reasons: A friend of mine recommended it to
me a long time ago (thanks, Carlos!)  In addition, I was curious to see
other works of Irene Jacob, who I just saw in U.S. Marshals.  I want first
to apologize to Carlos for waiting so long to see this wonderful film.
Second, I want to let off some steam about how wasted Irene Jacob's talents
were in U.S. Marshals.  Jacob is a brilliant actress -- as she demonstrates
in Red-- and her talents are completely wasted on playing such a throwaway
part in U.S. Marshals.  I hope Irene Jacob gets some better roles in the
future; she deserves them.
Along with the brilliant performance by Irene Jacob comes the equally great
performance by Jean-Louis Trintignant as The Judge.  He plays his role
perfectly.  Watch for the scene in which he offers tea to Valentine.
Worth mentioning is Piotr Sobocinski's beautiful cinematography and Claude
Lenoir's production design.  Both stress the color red in a way that is
non-intrusive and not distracting.
I wish more American filmmakers would take risks and put out movies like
Red where the audience is drawn into the film not by the action or special
effects but by the well-written, thought-provoking story and well-rounded
dimensional characters. You can find Red on video; the dialogue is all
French with English subtitles.   If you're looking for a testosterone-laden
movie with guns, babes, fast cars, explosions and a mindless plot, look
elsewhere.  If you're looking for a thoughtful well-written film, Don't
Miss Red.

Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
I thought Chris Carter (creator of The X-Files) and Oliver Stone were
paranoid. No, there's someone more paranoid than these two put together:
David Macroni, the screenwriter of Enemy of the State.
Washington D.C. labour lawyer, Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith), is an
ordinary guy. Dean lives a stable and uncomplicated life with his wife
(Regina King) and kid, and he has a good job. I don't think he could ask
for anything more. That is, until he bumps into a long unseen friend Zavitz
(Jason Lee) one day.
It turns out that Zavitz, while shooting video of migrating ducks
accidentally records the murder of a high-positioned congressman. The
congressman is the head of a committee overlooking a privacy bill in the
House that could possibly strip all Americans of their privacy. This bill
would let the government, especially the National Security Agency, install
wiretaps and spy on any American. The congressman is highly opposed to the
bill and has the ears of many in the committee. NSA official, Reynolds (Jon
Voight) does not like the congressman's stand on the bill and he'll do
anything to get it passed -- including killing the congressman so that a
more supportive person can step up to head the committee.
Zavitz, on the run from some rogue NSA guys who are under the lead of
Reynolds, leaves the incriminating tape with Dean, without Dean knowing it.
When the NSA guys figure out that Dean has the tape, they go after Dean -
who still doesn't know that he has the tape. The NSA guys tear up Dean's
life. They split his marriage with a fake affair. They cause Dean to lose
his job. Dean's credit cards are cancelled. Dean's identity is all lost.
Dean seeks the help of an informer known only as Brill (Gene Hackman).
Brill is a shadowy figure who works in an abandoned warehouse and surrounds
his workplace with copper mesh to keep the government from listening in.
Brill, a former NSA man, knows how the NSA works and knows how to defeat
them at their own game. Brill is Dean's only hope.
Enemy of the State focuses on two long and exhilarating chase scenes. The
film then tops itself off with one, though highly improbable, shootout.
This wraps the film up nicely, but it feels contrived - though, at that
point, who cares because it was a hell of a shootout.
Brill serves as the spokesperson for screenwriter, Macroni. He talks about
how the government has an underground monitoring station that can listen to
any of our telephone conversations. He lets Dean know about the hundreds of
satellites overhead that can track anyone's movements. He talks about how
we're all wired in some way and how we cannot escape the eyes and ears of
the US government.
What is surprising is that most of what Brill talks about can be possible -
frighteningly possible. Like it or not, there's no way to not leave a
digital footprint. Use your ATM card, charge something, or make a telephone
call and all of these things will leave a digital footprint. Someone,
including our own government, can track what we do because of this. Perhaps
the government isn't spying on us, but how can we be sure? As Brill points
out, if call someone and use one of a hundred catchphrases such as "bomb",
"president" or "Allah", a computer will mark your telephone call as a
priority and queue it to be analyzed by a human.
Enemy of the State is not a thought-provoking film, but it does raise some
questions that stick long after leaving the theatre. For the most part, it
is an action film, and as such it is outstanding. Coming from producer
Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, The Rock, Top Gun) and directed by Tony
Scott (Crimson Tide, Top Gun) Enemy of the State is an all out
roller-coaster ride that doesn't take a second to catch its breath.
Scott is a director whom I take a liking to. He has a definite flair to his
direction and he really shines with Enemy of the State. Scott pulls out
every trick from his director's bag for this movie. Using sped up/slowed
down film, strange satellite footage, and many quick cuts, Scott polishes
this film until it's so shiny that the audience can see their reflection on
the screen. Like Michael Bay's The Rock, Scott keeps Enemy of the State
moving at such a speed that the audience isn't left with any time to think
about all the gaping holes in the script. Scott puts out an entertaining
film that is a good two-hour diversion.
Will Smith has established that he is a versatile actor. His onscreen
charisma is what carried Independence Day and Men in Black. And he showed
that he's good with action in Bad Boys. In Enemy of the State, Smith tries
something new: a regular guy. Smith holds up well throughout the film;
kudos to Smith for a good performance.
Gene Hackman is always a joy to see on screen and with Enemy of the State
he's no different. In this second film with Tony Scott, Hackman gets to do
something different. In his first film with Scott, Crimson Tide, Hackman
was the captain of a nuclear submarine who was expected only to know where
and when to fire the nuclear missiles. His character in Crimson Tide was no
genius, but his character in Enemy of the State is. And Hackman handles the
part just fine. Hackman has a big screen presence and every time he's on
screen everything else falls to the wayside, including Will Smith.
By far, Enemy of the State is the most entertaining action film of this
fall season. With its spit-shine polished looks and its two lead actors,
Enemy of the State will entertain many with its visions of paranoia. Don't
Miss Enemy of the State and remember:
It's not paranoia if they're really after you.

Review for Deep Rising (1998)
Deep Rising is a B-movie stuck in an A-movie body. Director Stephen Sommers
(Jungle Book) is able to keep the campiness high and not take the film too
seriously, which keeps the film from falling flat on its face.
Imagine a film about a large luxury boat sinking with thousands dead or
dying.  No, this is not Titanic.  Nor does this film have any of the great
characteristics that made Titanic so wonderful. Missing are the characters
that we can latch onto or the plot to completely pull you into the film.
A group of heavily armed mercenaries is about to over take this huge luxury
boat, The Argonaut.  When they arrive and board the ship, they find that
the ship is empty and very bloody.  Not one soul can be found, not even a
corpse.
The mercenaries, led by Hanover (Wes Studi), are taken out to the luxury
ship by Finnegan (Treat Williams).  Aboard the ship, untouched by whatever
got to everyone else, is a beautiful jewel thief, Trillian (Famke Janssen).
As the mercenaries, along with Finnegan and crew, search out the ship, they
soon run into Trillian.  Together they find that there is something
horrible aboard the ship.
About halfway through the film we are introduced to the horror that is on
the ship.  It comes in the form of an octopus-like creature that ravaged
the ship and its passengers. Now, do not imagine a common octopus that you
might see at the local aquarium.  This creature is huge and it is hungry.
How does the creature terrorize these people?  Think tentacles.  Think jaws
on tentacles. Think speed and deadly aim. That's how this creature
terrorizes the main characters.
Deep Rising is not a horrible movie but at points it's a painful movie.
What is most painful about the movie?  Kevin J. O'Connor.  His character,
Joey (Finnegan's ship mechanic), is written as the comic relief of the film
but serves as the opposite.  Every time he was on screen I kept mentally
cheering, "Die, Joey!  Die!"  Part of what makes him so annoying is his
voice and the other is the horrible lines that he gets. His screen time is
as enjoyable as chewing aluminum foil.
I'm happy to say that everyone else fares a bit better in the film,
especially Treat Williams and Framke Janssen.  Both suffer from bad
dialogue, but as a whole, their reputation comes out somewhat unscathed.
It's nice to see Famke Janssen again; she was introduced to us in GoldenEye
as a bad Bond girl. One face that might stand out is Djimon Hounsou's, one
of the mercenaries.  It's disappointing to see Hounsou in such a mediocre
and short role after seeing his wonderful performance in Amistad.
The music by Jerry Goldsmith is forgettable.  At times, the score seems
overly campy, which fits the movie just right.  Then there are times when
the score is too serious and falls out of place.
The special effects are admirable.  The creature is scary enough, but
director Sommers does not use it to its full potential.  One special effect
that disappointed was "the fireball." When is Hollywood going to learn that
it is impossible to outrun an exploding fireball?
Deep Rising's saving grace is that it doesn't take itself too seriously.
>From its campy script to its over-the-top action and its cool looking
creature, Deep Rising is a blast if you don't walk into the theatre
expecting too much.  If you want to have some mindless fun, catch Deep
Rising in the theatres.

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
I'm sure I'm going to take heat for this negative review of The Thin Red
Line  but, hey, I'm not here to please everyone, am I?
The Thin Red Line comes out on the heels of Saving Private Ryan. The better
of the two is Saving Private Ryan -- by a long shot. The Thin Red Line is a
long and monotonous film that fails to get the audience attached to the
characters in the film. If Saving Private Ryan was fast and visceral, then
The Thin Red Line would be slow and methodical. The thing that Saving
Private Ryan has over The Thin Red Line was focus. And without focus The
Thin Red Line is unable to fully bring the horrors of war to us.
The Thin Red Line takes place on the island of Guadalcanal during the
Second World War. It follows a group of soldiers who fight to take control
of the island from the Japanese. That is about all of the story that one
can grasp from the movie. The rest of the movie is split between voice
overs, flashbacks, and shots of nature.
In Screenwriting 101, screenwriters are taught not to introduce too many
characters too quickly. This is a logical rule to understand. If you
introduce too many characters too quickly, you'll quickly leave the
audience shrugging their shoulders. If the audience doesn't have characters
to hold onto and relate to, the emotional impact of the film fizzles. With
The Thin Red Line characters are thrown about like mad and I could find
none to relate to; none to hold onto during the film. There is a character
introduced briefly during the opening scenes, but he remains almost
nameless and faceless throughout the film. The Thin Red Line fails in
bringing the audience to terms with its characters.
The script by Terrence Malick is based on the novel by James Jones. I have
not read the novel and cannot tell you how close the script sticks to the
novel. The script though is slow and meanders. I found myself looking at my
watch constantly during the film. The slow aimless script put with some
lazy editing makes the film very tedious to sit through. There are a few
times when the film feels like it's over but then continues on.
There are some good elements to the film though. First and foremost is the
performance given by Nick Nolte. Nolte, whom I last saw in Affliction,
gives a wonderful performance as a man who has waited for more than 15
years to prove that he's war-worthy.
The other thing to look for in the film is the beautiful cinematography by
John Toll. In Saving Private Ryan we had a visceral and drained look which
fit that film just right. In The Thin Red Line we have a colorful and
vibrant look which is wonderful to look at. But, is also a good contrast to
the things happening onscreen.
The battle scenes that take up most of the midsection of The Thin Red Line
are technically brilliant  matching those of Saving Private Ryan. Though
the battle scenes in The Thin Red Line are less gory, they still have the
same impact as those in Saving Private Ryan.
What bothered me most, next to the lack of any true characters, is the fact
that the director, Terrence Malick, has obviously put a lot of work into
the film but has put it into all the wrong places. Everything about the
film feels too worked out and there are times when the film wanders
aimlessly. For instance, it was nice to see nature in the film; the
crocodile, the wounded bird, the multiple wide shots of the forrest and
island, but after a while the film felt like a nature documentary. Yes, a
lot of the shots that I talk about are symbolic in nature, but, with half
the audience nodding off, symbolism really doesn't matter.
Don't be fooled by the big names listed in the previews. John Travolta and
George Clooney get one scene each and then they disappear. John Cussack
gets some screen time but also disappears. Sean Penn and Nick Nolte are the
two that get more than a handful of scenes. Do look for Elias Koteas as
Captain Staros, he gives a performance to remember.
The Thin Red Line could have been one hell of a war film had a few things
been fixed. First, the running time of two hours and 50 minutes could have
been easily trimmed to about two hours. And the script could have been
rewritten to give the audience something to relate to. As it stands there
is almost no emotional impact from the script. I walked of the theatre
untouched by the film. Catch The Thin Red Line on video, the battle scenes
are incredible. Next to that, there's nothing more to the film.

Review for Lost in Space (1998)
I'm not old enough to have seen the Lost in Space TV series.  And though
many of the people going to see Lost in Space will have enjoyed the series,
I figure there are going to be a lot of people like me who have never seen
it either.  Knowing the TV series is not one of the prerequisites for the
movie though.  There's only one prerequisite for the movie: The willingness
to turn off your brain.  
Lost in Space begins with a loud and eyebrow-raising space dogfight that
had me at the edge of my seat.  With the adrenaline up, I thought I was
going to be in for a roller coaster ride of a movie, but things slow down.
>From here we get some background story and learn about the Robinson family
and why they are planning to leave Earth for Alpha Prime.
It seems that Earth's resources are being depleted at a horrific rate and
in a short time, the Earth will no longer be able to support human life.
The only way to save the human race is to move and inhabit another planet.
That planet--with water and a suitable atmosphere--is Alpha Prime.
However, in order to get people off Earth in a timely manner, there needs
to be a quick way to get them across the galaxy.  This is where the
Robinsons fall into the story.
The Robinsons are to travel by space ship to Alpha Prime and set up a jump
gate -- much like the one in Stargate, but in space -- so that it can match
up with the jump gate being built on Earth.  Once both gates are completed,
humans can be shipped across the galaxy via hyperspace and arrive at Alpha
Prime instantaneously.  Without the gates, though, any hyperspace travel
will shoot the travelers into some unknown position in space -- as the
Robinsons are quick to find out.  The Robinson family is composed of: John
(William Hurt) the father and professor, Maureen (Mimi Rogers) the mom and
professor, Judy (Heather Graham) the oldest daughter and doctor, Penny
(Lacey Chabert) the younger daughter, and Will (Jack Johnson) the son.
The Robinsons will travel 10 years in the ship Jupiter 2, which will be
piloted by Major Don West (Matt LeBlanc).  Major West is taken straight out
of the movie Top Gun, spilling embarrassing lines as "Rock 'n Roll!" and
"Putting the pedal to the metal!"
Unbeknownst to the family, the evil Doctor Smith has been left for dead
aboard the Jupiter 2 after he sabotages the mission to Alpha Prime.
Sixteen hours into the flight all Hell breaks loose; John and Major West
wake up to discover that the Jupiter 2 is trapped in the Sun's
gravitational pull and they are soon going to go melting into the Sun.
Major West flies the Jupiter 2 through the Sun with the hyperdrive engines.
 Yes, you read that right, he flies through the Sun.  The drawback of the
hyperdrive again is that the ship is shot into some unknown part of space.
Or is it?
The family soon finds that they are floating next to a man-made space ship
that looks much like the Event Horizon.  But, I was relieved to find that
it was not the dreaded Event Horizon, it is the Proteus. From here the
movie has two more "acts" or parts.  One includes exploring the Proteus and
the other is exploring an icy planet.
The last few minutes of the film make no apparent sense.  It includes time
travel and some more hyperspace jumping.  If you have seen Lost in Space
and understand what was going on with the time travel, please let me know
what it's all about.
Smith is supposed to be the main antagonist in Lost in Space but a few
others crop up, maybe unintentionally.  And those would be the family
members themselves.  The Robinsons are not quite a close knit family.
Actually, they are the poster family for dysfunctional families in America.
 In Lost in Space, the family spends more time arguing with each other than
with Doctor Smith.
Lost in Space has two major flaws.  First, the script by Akiva Goodsman is
horrible.  For those of you who don't know the name Akiva Goodsman, he's
the guy who wrote the awful follow-ups to the first two Batman films.
Batman and Robin contains the worst writing I've ever heard.  This writer
has no clue about how to write dialogue.  He only knows how to write
one-liners and short quips-- and even these made me cringe.  
Second, Stephen Hopkins directs the movie.  Hopkins is the director who
brought us Blown Away and Ghost and the Darkness.  I've only seen Blown
Away and that was an uneven thriller, at best.  Lost in Space suffers from
the same problem that Hopkin's Blown Away did:  the direction is very
uneven.  He can certainly get the adrenaline pumping during action scenes,
but he is not able to take that energy and move it into some of the
non-action scenes.  Hopkins has no clue about pacing.
The actors are OK.  William Hurt is somewhat bland as John Robinson, but
heck, I can see why, he's an egghead like myself.  Mimi Rogers does what
she can with her "Come home safe, John" role.  Heather Graham, whom I loved
in Boogie Nights, gets a throwaway part here. She really doesn't have much
to do.  Lacey Chabert, who looks like a miniature version of Neve Campbell
with a 'magic-marker as eye-liner look' and Daffy Duck voice, is a toss up
between really annoying and really really annoying. Jack Johnson is
actually pretty worthy as Will Robinson, but he doesn't get enough screen
time.  Matt LeBlanc is Joey from Friends in space, he's not doing too much
new here.  The big performance is from Gary Oldman and he is not given
enough time either.
One small thing that Lost in Space suffers from is what I call the "Ewok
Syndrome."  This is where the moviemakers throw in a cute creature into a
movie just so that they can sell cute dolls on the after-market.  For
Return of the Jedi it was the Ewoks, for Lost in Space it's a space monkey
of sorts named Blawp, which serves no purpose and even detracts from the
film.  New Line just wants to sell Blarp dolls to little kids who find
Blarp cute.
So, what's good about Lost in Space?  It's special effects, sets,
landscapes, and fun factor. The press releases for Lost in Space boast that
it has some 700-plus special effects.  I didn't bother to count, but the
special effects are pretty impressive.  The sets by Norman Garwood are
beautiful and very futuristic.  The landscapes are nothing but
awe-inspiring; they bring back memories of the landscapes from The Fifth
Element.  And the fun factor is definitely there if you ignore the lame
story and unnecessarily convoluted plot.
In the end, with all of its flaws, Lost in Space is fun to see.  But,
please walk into the theatre with the brain in the "off" position.  Don't
Miss Lost in Space.  Danger Will Robinson!  Lost in Space is a mindless fun
movie!

Title
Review for Under Siege (1992)
Steven Seagal is not known for making good movies. And I admit I don't like
him very much. But, most of the time I find myself watching his movies. I
think it's out of the hope that one day he'll be able to make a good
enjoyable action movie. After I saw Under Siege, I have just about stopped
meandering into his movies, why? Because this is the Steven Seagal movie
that I like and think is good and enjoyable.
Under Siege is a typical high-concept film. The concept: one man, trapped
in an enclosed area taken hostage by bad guys who don't know he's there.
The "Die Hard Concept". In Die Hard it was Willis' John McClane in a
building, in Under Siege it's Seagal's Casey Ryback in a boat. Casey Ryback
is a cook aboard a battleship. During a party for the captain a group of
over-the-top bad guys lead by Tommy Lee Jones take the ship over. The one
person that the villains didn't expect to stop their evil plan? Yes, the
cook. Seagal's Ryback is a one man fighting machine able to take out a
whole group of heavily trained killers. The story is simple, a group of
terrorist wants weapons and the battleship has them. Jones leads the
terrorist to get the weapons.
Yes, the plot is understandably absurd, but it works and director Andrew
Davis (The Fugitive) finds some inventive ways of making the film work. He
puts enough action in the film to keep the audience from thinking, adds to
this some cool gadgets and some incredible shots of the ship and wraps this
all together with the great performances of Jones and Seagal (something I
thought I'd never find myself saying, Seagal? Good performance?)
Seagal's characters never seem to get hurt, but in Under Siege that
changes, he actually bleeds. There is blood running through this character.
And though Seagal does a good job with his role, Tommy Lee Jones is the one
to look for in this film. His over-the-top performance as the villain is
great. The one character that I don't quite understand why they added was
Erika Eleniak's Playmate Jordan Tate. The only reason I see for this is for
a scene of gratuitous nudity and for her to, for some scenes, play the
damsel-in-distress.
There are certain films from action stars you hate that stand out, for Van
Damme it was Hard Target, for Seagal it's Under Siege. This is a well
directed and well put together movie. It has some excellent action
sequences and a good insane villain. This is the only film with Seagal as a
lead that I can really say, Don't Miss this film.

Title
Review for Vampires (1998)
Don't let the title fool you -- Vampires is not a horror film. Vampires is
a Western set in modern times where the good guys carry big silver
crossbows and the bad guys wear long incisors. Plotless and mindless,
Vampires is proof that a good director, actor and film personality can make
a testosterone-laden movie entertaining.
Jack Crow (James Woods) is a vampire slayer. Scratch that, Crow is a
vampire slayer with a serious attitude. Having seen his mother and father
fall to vampires, Crow has his mind set on killing all vampires. From
childhood, the Catholic Church has raised Crow to be a vampire slayer. The
Catholic Church, from an exorcism gone awry, created the first vampire,
Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), centuries ago. As the movie opens, Crow and
his team go into action by taking out a whole house of vampires.
After the house incident, Crow has a nasty run in with Valek. Valek is the
most powerful vampire because he was the first. Valek escapes Crow's first
attempt to take him out, though Valek ends up biting a hooker before his
getaway. Crow uses the hooker (Sheryl Lee) as a vampire-radar of sorts.
After being bitten by a vampire, a person doesn't turn into a vampire
immediately. There is a period before the bitten person "turns." During
this crucial time a telepathic link is set up between the bitten and the
master (the vampire who did the biting). Crow uses the hooker to track down
Valek.
As I mentioned, Vampires is proof of what a good director, good actor and
film personality can do to enhance a film. Last week I saw Soldier, a
terrible film; the director was a rookie, the lead actor didn't have much
to work with, and the film had no personality. Vampires has all three.
Director John Carpenter knows how to put together some exciting scenes 
though, his pacing for the film as a whole is off. Carpenter mixes the
right amount of action, horror, and humor for the action scenes, and he
builds a lot of tension. But, he is unable to pace the film correctly. The
best parts of the film are the opening vampire hunt and the last
thirty-five minutes. The middle section of Vampires is slow and sometimes
painfully so. Had Carpenter taken the movie and distilled it - stripped it
of the useless character development and the love story  it would have
been to die for. The opening vampire hunt is gory with vampires dragged
into the sun and burned instantly to a crisp. There are other extremely
gory scenes, like a man split in half, all shown onscreen. This is
definitely not a movie for the squeamish.
The second thing that Vampires has is James Woods. Woods brings to screen a
brash will-take-no-crap attitude that is used effectively as a tool of
humor. I loved the way that Woods breaks in the new priest and how he later
deals with the master vampires. Woods brings a personality to the character
Jack Crow that would have been lacking if another actor attempted the part.
Woods just drips of coolness onscreen; he's cool, tough, and arrogant.
There would be no other actor better for the part of Jack Crow.
The personality of a film is important. Take for example, Soldier, the film
had no personality - it was bland. Vampires, on the other hand, has
personality. The mixture of Woods, the way the film was shot, the lone
guitar in the film score, and the sure-handedness of Carpenter's direction
all add up to make this movie enjoyable.
Vampires is not Carpenter's best work, but it's also not Carpenter's worst
work either. Ranking at the top is Carpenter's The Thing, Halloween, Escape
from New York, and Escape from LA. Vampires is a middle-of-the-road,
average Carpenter film.
Would I recommend Vampires? Definitely, it's an entertaining film. For
those of you worried that Vampires is a scary horror film, it's not 
though it is quite gory. I enjoyed Vampires because it's a modern Western

Review for Air Force One (1997)
On the surface Air Force One looks like a formula film, "Die Hard on a
plane." But, as the movie starts, we see that it is different, though not
much, from the formula. 
Harrison Ford is the President of the US, James Marshall.  And as the name
somewhat suggest, he is somewhat like a cowboy.
In a team effort between the US and Russia, the leader of rebellious
Kazakhstan is captured. The President is in Moscow giving a speech and
taking a stand against terrorism.  After the speech, the President boards
Air Force One and this is where the fun starts.
The movie opens with the capturing of the Kazakhstan leader.  This sequence
opens the film with a bang, and sets the mood for the rest of the film.
The film is packed with action, and surprisingly, most of it is well done
and takes place on Air Force One.  This is surprising because of the tight
quarters that the surrounds the action.  Some sequences that are of the
wow-factor are the refueling plane, the many gunfights, the C-140 sequence,
and the sequences with the F-15s.
As the plane is being hijacked, the President is put into an escape pod and
ejected.  But this would be too easy of a solution.  The President, with
the motivation to save his wife and daughter, stays on the plane,
unbeknownst to the terrorists.
Gary Oldman plays the terrorist.  He is a hard communist and wants to
reinstate Communism to Russia.  He and a team of men take over Air Force
One and threaten the Vice President (Glenn Close) and Defense Secretary
(Dean Stockwell).  Their threat is that if the leader of Kazakhstan is not
released, then one hostage will be eliminated each half-hour.
The story moves quickly, and the action is spectacular. There are some
minor details that bugged me, but not much.  The terrorists are near blind
and the President has a great shot.  The load of weapons on Air Force One
is incredible and somewhat easily accessible.  And for one minor character
we never do learn his motivation.
Ford, like always, is a joy to watch.  He gives a great performance in Air
Force One.  Oldman does a good job at his part also.  He is as much, and
maybe a little more intense than Ford. Wolfgang Petersen, who directed
Clint Eastwood in The Line of Fire, does a great job of building tension
and creating dazzling action. There is one character, which I won't name,
that is like the wrench in the wheel.  And this character lives almost to
the end of the movie.  All of this time making you wonder what the
character is going to do. I loved how this character was used, although
sparingly, in the film.
Air Force One is a late comer to the summer action movie territory, but it
makes up for this by being one of the most exciting films of this summer.
The action in Air Force One never really goes into the yeah-right category,
but is always in the wow-and-ouch category. Air Force One is a must-see
movie. And when you walk out of the theatre, you too will be saying like
me, "I'm proud to be an American!"

Review for City of Angels (1998)
How many days have you watched the sun rise and fall?  What does a pear
taste like?  How does a kiss feel from the one you love?  What does the
touch of a hand on your hand feel like?  What is it like to love?  When you
die, what will be the best thing about your life?
Seth, the angel from City of Angels, wonders all of these things.  Angels
are fearless, can't feel pain, are not afraid of heights and live for
eternity.  But what good is eternity if you can't be with the one you love?
 Or as Seth puts it, "What good would wings be if you couldn't feel the
wind on your face?"
One day a heart surgeon, Maggie Rice (Meg Ryan), is working on a patient.
She's almost finished when the patient suddenly dies.  Watching over this
event is the benevolent angel, Seth (Nicolas Cage).  Seth is so emotionally
thrown by this event that he suddenly becomes visible to Maggie.
Seth wonders why she saw him.  He also finds himself in love with Maggie,
and returns to the hospital to follow her around, watching Maggie in
distress. Seth finds himself increasingly attracted to Maggie.  Then one
day he makes himself visible to Maggie and tries to ease her pain.  Just
how well could a relationship between an angel and a human work?  Seth
finds out from a former angel that he has a choice to be human.  But, in
order to be human Seth needs to take a fall from Heaven and give up his
eternal life.
City of Angels is not a spiritual film nor does it have any deep insights
into the "life" of angels.  It is a near-formulaic tearjerker and works for
only one reason:  Meg Ryan, who is radiant in her part as Maggie.  This has
to be her best work since Courage Under Fire.  It is Ryan that makes the
story wonderful.  Ryan brings us into the love story and we do start to
care for her Maggie much more than we do for Cage's Seth.
Nicolas Cage, who has been toting guns lately (The Rock, Con Air,
Face/Off), takes a break from the macho side of celluloid to return to some
familiar ground.  His portrayal of Seth the angel is not as good as it
should have been. Cage spends too much time with puppy dog eyes and a soft
voice.  He seems just too mellow as the angel Seth. 
There are many things worth mentioning about City of Angels.  First off is
the ethereal and stylish cinematography by John Seale (The English
Patient).  Seale films Los Angeles in such a fashion that what could look
stale and flat now looks dynamic and large.  The shots of solitary angels
standing in high places are just wondrous.  Kudos to John Seale for
bringing such a different look to Los Angeles.  Please look for the scenes
in which angels congregate at the beach for sunrise and sunset.  These are
the most inspiring images that the film contains. 
Worth mentioning is Andre Braugher from TVs "Homicide."  Braugher, as the
angel Cassiel, puts in a better angel performance than Cage.  Dennis Franz
from TVs "NYPD Blue" makes an appearance in City of Angels and, next to Meg
Ryan, his is the best performance in the whole film.  
The score by Gabriel Yared is haunting and memorable.  In addition, the
music by other artists fits the film well.  Listen for Alanis Morissette's
"Uninvited."
I didn't care for one flaw.  It's not a huge flaw, but it is noticeable.
The "twist" at the end is set up mechanically from the beginning of the
film and I continued to wonder when it would happen.  This renders the
ending unclimactic, and I would have liked the film to end a few minutes
earlier.  However, as Cassiel reminds Seth, "That's living."
The script, written by Dana Stevens, is based on Wings of Desire, a 1988
film by Wim Wenders.  I have not seen Wings of Desire so I can't comment on
how these two films differ.
City of Angels is one of the best angel movies to be released lately.  I
admit that the film tugged a few tears from me.  See City of Angels for the
wondrous imagery and for Meg Ryan.  Don't Miss City of Angels on the big
screen and bring a loved one to see it with you; this is definitely a date
film.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to watch the sun go down.

Title
Review for Wild Things (1998)
Wild Things falls into the "stupid but fun" group.  The plot is laughable,
the dialogue is hilarious, and all the major performers think they're in
different types of pictures.  Even the director looks like he's unable to
figure out what kind of movie this is supposed to be.
In the hardly sleepy town of Blue Bay resides a high school where all the
students look like magazine models.  In Blue Bay, people sleep with just
about everyone else; "promiscuity" is as common a word as "eating."  People
in this town look good and dress to promote themselves. So, what's the
problem in this town?
A student, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), claims her counselor, Sam
Lombardo (Matt Dillon), raped her.   But did he?  There is a doubt to Van
Ryan's claims until another student, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell), comes
forward and says that Sam Lombardo too raped her.  Investigating this rape
case are two Blue Bay cops, Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez
(Daphne Rubin-Vega).
To tell any more of the story would spoil the movie.  Wild Things tries
hard to entertain the audience.  At most points the twists and turns in the
script work-but barely.  Wild Things is by far an example of how to make a
movie so bad that it actually looks good.
The twists and turns in Wild Things are mostly predictable but it is the
execution that makes them so enjoyable.  As I was watching the film, I was
trying to guess when and what would come up next.  And like James
Berardinelli, a prominent Internet film critic, I missed only one of the
twists.  However, as I said, it's the execution that makes the twist so
fun.  The script by Kem Numm and Stephen Peters has dialogue that goes so
deeply overboard it is laughable.
The lead performers, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, and Denise Richards all
play their parts  tongue in cheek.  Dillon is likeable as the beat up
school counselor Lombardo.  Campbell seems to be relishing her part as the
tramp in the trailer park.  And Richards is given a handful more lines than
she had in Starship Troopers, but she is not given much more to work with.
In the supporting roles look for two outstanding performances; Bill Murray
as a Lombardo's sleazy lawyer and new comer Daphne Rubin-Vega as Kevin
Bacon's partner. Wild Things is full of unintentional laughs but Murray
brings some much-needed intentional comedy to Wild Things.  Rubin-Vega is a
newcomer but gives a wonderful performance.
For bad performers look for Robert Wagner as Kelly Van Ryan's lawyer and
Theresa Russell as Kelly Van Ryan's slutty mom.  Wagner seems to believe
that he is in a serious movie and sticks out like a sore thumb. My
favourite Wagner moment is when Wagner meets Dillon's Lombardo and says,
"You're finished in Blue Bay.  Get lost!"  I laughed and cringed at this
line.  Theresa Russell seems to be parodying herself in this film.
Wild Things is a largely commercially aimed film.  How do I know that?  It
is gratuitous.  But, you might ask, in what?  The answer:  it has
everything that will bring near or post-pubescent boys to the theatres:
sex and violence.  And for those of you curious, Denise Richards and
Theresa Russell get topless scenes and Kevin Bacon gets a full frontal nude
scene.
Should you see Wild Things?  Yes.  I'd recommend Wild Things during a
matinee showing.  This film is an unintentional comedy with a twist of
mystery and twist of thriller.  Sure, the film is trash, but it's fun
trash.  Don't pick up and leave once you see the credits!  There are some
fun credit cookies that will throw in more twists.  Don't Miss Wild Things
in the theatres.

Review for Jui kuen II (1994)
A good thing about Jackie Chan films is that they are all the same. This
makes it easy for the audience to overlook the flimsy plot and enjoy the
spectacular stunts. In all of the recent US re-releases of Chan's films,
they have been set in current time. In Drunken Master II it's different,
this film takes place in the past and all fights are hand to hand (and
since it is a Jackie Chan film, it also takes place while improvising with
many different common objects). 
The plot in Drunken Master II is short: A group of Chinese are helping the
British ship valuable Chinese artifacts out of China. Jackie Chan's
character, Wong Fei-Hong, accidentally stumbles upon this plot and it is
now up to him to stop this. Wong Fei-Hong is skilled in a special fighting
style called Drunken Boxing.
The fighting scenes in Drunken Master II are, to say the least, incredible.
They definitely out do most of the fight scenes in US re-releases,
including those in First Strike. The end-fighting scene is most impressive.
The times between fighting scenes are sometimes long, but they are still
entertaining, and very funny.
Drunken Master II has not been redone for re-release in the US, yet. I hope
it will be soon though, it is a great show case film for Jackie Chan's
fighting and entertainment abilities. If you have a laserdisc player, you
can find the laserdisc for Drunken Master II out now. The version that I
saw was the laserdisc version, it is presented in Cantonese and the English
subtitles are hard to read. Find a copy to watch, or if you don't have a
laserdisc player, find a friend with one and have them rent this for you to
see. This is a definite must-see movie.

Title
Review for Urban Legend (1998)
Have you ever heard the story about the group of teens being chased by a
masked man? You know the story, where there's a hip theme and some
good-looking actors. Thinking of Scream? Wrong. Maybe it's Scream 2? Wrong.
OK, it's gotta be I Know What You Did Last Summer! Wrong! It's Urban
Legend. Urban Legend is the next hip-slasher film to come down the pipe
after the revival of the slasher-film genre by Scream.
In my review of I Know What You Did Last Summer I listed the common
elements of the '90s hip-slasher films. Here's a quick rundown 1) The
killer has to wear some sort of a mask -- this time around the killer is
dressed as an Eskimo. 2) There needs to be ditsy female leads with ample
cleavage. 3) There needs to be a cast of one-dimensional characters that
serve as slasher fodder. I'm adding one more to this list: 4) There needs
to be a point in the film where the undead dead killer returns for a final
round. I'm happy to say that Urban Legend dutifully fills all these
requirements.
On the campus of a quiet Maine university, a student, Natalie (Alicia
Witt), is being harassed by a killer who is dressed like an Eskimo and
likes to kill people by methods based on urban legends. Urban legends are
modern folktales that may be true or may just be a hoax. We all know one or
two urban legends, and a few are covered in the movie. During the movie we
get The Ax Murderer in the Backseat, Pop Rocks & Pepsi, The Hung Lover,
Woman Who Dried Her Dog in the Microwave, and a few more.
Sounds like a good premise. It reminds me of another movie, CopyCat, that
used a similar premise. In CopyCat, the killer modeled his killings on
previous serial killers. The difference between CopyCat and Urban Legend is
that CopyCat is a good movie with good scares. Urban Legend is not.
The thrills in Urban Legend come in the form known as Cheap Scares. Cheap
Scares are the type of scares in which a person's head fills the screen,
they are walking forward, and then WHAM! someone touches their shoulder.
The WHAM! is punctuated with a burst from the musical score. It's not a
scare that's built up, it's just something that startles us. Urban Legend
does this repeatedly -- four or five times in the first half-hour. If I
wanted this kind of scare, I'd have a monkey follow me around with a gong.
Some moments in the film are horrific though. I loved the opening (The Ax
Murderer in the Backseat), which is slowly built up. Tension is never too
high in Urban Legend.
Two actors in Urban Legend are serviceable Alicia Witt ("Cybill") and Jared
Leto (Switchback, Prefontaine). Witt does a good job onscreen, though she
doesn't have the scream of a "scream queen." Leto doesn't get too much
screen time, but he does OK.
One actress sticks out like a sore thumb. I'm not sure what Rebecca
Gayheart was aiming for, but she overshoots it by a mile. Gayheart just
plainly overacts in Urban Legend.
Writer Silvio Horta actually gets the movie off to a good start. The first
half of the movie -- Cheap Scares and all -- works well. However, as we
slide into the halfway mark of the film, things go downhill. Red herrings
and cliches are thrown at us like doggie-treats. And as the body count
rises in the film, the thrill of this thriller proportionally drops. After
awhile I just wanted the Eskimo to wipe out the whole school and be over
with it.
Would I recommend Urban Legend? No. Rent Scream or Scream 2 for some good
thrills. Urban Legend is just a bad knock-off of Scream.
Hey monkey, hit that gong!  Scared?

Review for Playing by Heart (1998)
With thousands, perhaps millions, of scripts flying around Hollywood for a
script to be produced there needs to be an ingenious twist. Playing By
Heart has one of these ingenious twist to it. If I reveal it, it'll spoil
the film.
Playing By Heart starts off spinning threads of stories with many different
characters. Unlike the film I saw last week, The Thin Red Line, where too
many characters killed the film, Playing By Heart uses the abundant amount
of characters to draw us in. At its heart, the movie is a series of
blossoming relationships. The film focuses on the stories of four women
known only by their first names. Meredith (Gillian Anderson), Joan
(Angelina Jolie), Gracie (Madeleine Stowe), and Hannah (Gena Rowlands) are
the women that the story focuses on.
Meredith is being pursued by an architect, Trent (Jon Stewart). Joan is
pursuing a man that she met at a dance club, Keenan (Ryan Phillippe).
Gracie is having an affair with a man (Anthony Edwards). And Hannah is
trying to straighten up a marriage with her husband of 40 years, Paul (Sean
Connery). There is also a story line about a dying man (Jay Mohr) and his
reconciling with his mother.
What I like about the script by Willard Carroll is that it is able to keep
us interested in almost all of these stories and he does it in such a way
that we are rewarded at the end of the film. Sure, a bit of it is quite
predictable, but that was part of the fun of watching this film. There is
one story line that didn't really fit well, or was not as interesting as it
could have been, and that was Gracie's story line. But, that is a small
complaint about a well-written script. Kudos to Carroll for putting
together a fun script. Carroll also takes up the directing duties with
Playing By Heart and does well at it also.
The performances to look for, and there are lots because of the ensemble
cast, are Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie, Gena Rowlands, and Sean
Connery. It was nice to see Anderson do something substantial that has
nothing to do with aliens or government conspiracies. I love her as Agent
Scully, but it is great to see Anderson expanding her horizons and taking
other roles. Jolie does well, she has almost the same role as she did in
Hackers, but this time around the role is softer and requires more emotion.
Jolie handles it well. Rowlands who was the standout performance in Hope
Floats turns in a wonderful performance in Playing By Heart. And Connery,
who seems to be doing a lot more low profile roles, is marvelous in this
film. It was disappointing to see him in the awful Avengers and this role
is more than enough to help me forget about his performance in Avengers.
Playing By Heart is one of those low profile films that get released
without a lot of push from the studios and may get lost in the shuffle.
But, I enjoyed the film immensely and left the theatre with a smile. Don't
Miss Playing By Heart in the theatres. And let me know if by the end of the
film you have all the threads connected. I was able to guess most of them,
but missed on big one.

Review for He Got Game (1998)
Sports movies are a hard genre to work with, especially if you don't want
to make a comedy or a family film - categories which most sports movies
fall into.  But, every once in a long while there comes a sports film that
is neither, and that really hits home.  The one that I remember most is
Field of Dreams.  I haven't seen a good sports film in a long time.
I'm certain that had He Got Game been done by any other writer/director it
would have failed, but in the hands of Spike Lee, He Got Game is one of the
best films of 1998 and will probably make my top 10 list.
Who's got game?  A kid named Jesus Shuttlesworth (Ray Allen), who's a
graduating senior at the real-life Lincoln high school on Coney Island.
Jesus is so good at basketball that every college wants him and every NBA
team wants him.  What is Jesus going to do?
Someone else has game also, though. Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington)
is the father of Jesus.  He's currently serving time in a prison with 15
years to go.  What landed Jake in prison?  He killed his wife.  With this
act, he split his whole family apart - turning Jesus into an embittered
young man who has taught himself to believe that he has no father.  With a
week to go before Jesus needs to decide about going to college or going
pro, the governor has a proposal for Jake.  He will try to reduce Jake's
sentence and help him get early parole if Jake will convince Jesus to go to
the governor's alma mater, Big State.
What Spike Lee does with He Got Game is amazing.  He slowly unravels a
story which on the surface looks and feels like a run-of-the-mill sports
film.  But underneath, he starts to reveal the pressure and events that
happen around a star basketball player ready to make "the most important
decision of his life."  Lee starts showing us that from sex, to money, to
new cars, the people around Jesus will try anything to convince him to do
what they want.  And with this, they also want a piece of what Jesus will
be making.
He Got Game relies directly on the relationship between the father and son.
 Onscreen this relationship lives, and lives only because of a brilliant
performance by Denzel Washington.  Washington puts his all onscreen and it
shows.  This time around, Washington is not playing an egghead - as in
Crimson Tide - or an everyday man - like in the forgettable but enjoyable
Fallen.  No, this time he plays a poor man with a lot of failings,
including the killing of his wife.  I walked in thinking that Washington
would play Jake as a hard-nosed embittered man, but my hunch turned out all
wrong.  The only embittered one was Jesus.  Washington plays Jake as a guy
who regrets most of the things that he has done in his life. 
The weak link in all of this is the stiff performance by Ray Allen.
Although Lee coerces Allen into a decent performance, it's not enough to
take He Got Game from a great film to an all-time great film.  It is a good
start for Allen, though, and I wish him well in his further acting jobs.
Spike Lee has always been a favourite writer and director of mine.  His Do
The Right Thing is one of my favourite films (and for those of you who
don't know me personally, my nickname is Mookie, which is the name of Lee's
character in Do The Right Thing.)  With He Got Game, Lee has one-upped
himself and this is now my favourite Spike Lee film.  Lee has a particular
style in the way that he shoots his films and this all shows in a wonderful
opening montage of people playing basketball across America.  This is one
of the best openings I've ever experienced and shows the love of basketball
that Lee has. 
What's interesting to note is that although He Got Game is about
basketball, there are no extended sequences of basketball in the movie.  We
only see a one-on-one game between Jake and Jesus.  We get some flashes of
basketball games, but the focus is never on the sport - Spike Lee uses it
to explore the things that go around the game.
Worth mentioning is the music by Aaron Copland, which is downright
American.  Copland's music along with Lee's imagery is wonderous.
Next to Ray Allen, there are two smaller weak links in He Got Game.  One is
a sub-plot about a prostitute (Milla Jovovich) and Jake.  And the other is
the awkward symbolic ending, which irked me the most.
He Got Game is a Don't Miss movie that never fails to entertain.  This film
is powerful, moving, and all the while it holds our attention with a
well-written relationship between a father and a son.

Review for It Could Happen to You (1994)
It Could Happen To You is a movie with the wrong title.  It's working title
was Cop Gives Waitress $2 Million Tip, which works a lot better.  It Could
Happen To You is a feel good, funny, and enchanting film.  
Nicolas Cage (The Rock, Face/Off) is Charlie Lang, a genuinely nice and
honest cop.  He is content with his job.  He is married to a loud obnoxious
woman, Muriel (Rosie Perez).  Then there's the waitress, Yvonne Biasi
(Bridgette Fonda) who is down on her luck and in bankruptcy.  One day
Charlie and his partner stop to get some coffee from a rundown café where
Yvonne works.  Charlie has enough to pay for the coffee but not the tip, so
tells Yvonne that he'll give her half of the winnings of the lottery ticket
in his wallet if he wins.  Yvonne brushes this offer off.
That night Charlie finds out that his ticket is a 4 million-dollar winner.
He tries to break the news of the $2 million "tip" to his wife Muriel.  And
as you might guess, she's not too happy about it.  Rosie Perez is hilarious
in this series of scenes.
Cage and Fonda are charming onscreen together.  They have a definite screen
chemistry and that carries the film well.  On the other side of the scale,
though, is Rosie Perez.  In some scenes she is hilarious, but in others she
is the epitome of annoyance.
Though not very creative, the film doesn't feel recycled so much as
familiar.  This could happen and it could happen to me.  Heck, it might
have happened to someone already.  And it is this feeling of familiarity
that makes It Could Happen To You so easy to love.  Kudos to Jane Anderson
for writing such a loveable film.
It Could Happen To You is a wonderful movie that in the end will leave you
feeling warm and fuzzy inside with a big grin on you face.  Don't Miss It
Could Happen To You.

Title
Review for G.I. Jane (1997)
G.I. Jane, what a wonderfully wrong name for this movie. Although this film
sounds like, and was promoted like, a drama about women in the military, it
doesn't go that route. The simplest way to describe G.I. Jane is that it's
an action film.
G.I. Jane is directed by Ridley Scott, from whom one of my most favorite
sci-fi films came from (Blade Runner), but the film feels suspiciously like
a Tony Scott film. (Tony is Ridley's brother, better known for his action
films like Top Gun, Days of Thunder, and Crimson Tide.) I'll get to the
looks and feel of the film later in this review.
Demi Moore is Lt. Jordan O'Neil, an intelligence officer chosen,
unknowingly, to be a pawn in a political game. The political game? Simple,
O'Neil joins the Navy SEALS in training. O'Neil is put into this position
by a fast talking senator, Lillian DeHaven, who wants to use O'Neil to get
re-elected and to look good to the press. The film follows O'Neil through
her SEAL training and also the political dealings behind her training. Most
interesting in the film is Viggo Mortensen (Daylight, Crimson Tide) as the
Master Chief. He gives a great performance, sometimes overshadowing Moore.
Moore seems to be reviving her role from Disclosure, without the hair and
with a gun. 
What I expected walking into the theatre was to see a drama that explores
the implications of females in the US Military, but what I got was an
action film that slightly touches on these issues. The film is filled with
characters, but unfortunately all of the characters are flat and
unmemorable. The only three characters that are memorable are O'Neil, the
Master Chief, and Anne Bancroft's DeHaven.
Other touches that I liked in the film were its heavy use of military
equipment, most especially the helicopters. It was nice to see so much of
the UH-1 Huey in a film, and also to see the AH-1 Cobra in action. The
training shown in the film looks tough, but does not sound exactly right.
I've seen an interview with a SEAL, on the Criterion laserdisc of The Rock,
that describes the intense training to become a SEAL, and although some of
the training is shown on the screen, some of the hardest is only mentioned
slightly via dialog or is left out.
The feel and look of the film seems to be a strange mix between the two
Scott brothers. There's heavy use of fog and smoke, which is a Ridley
thing. But then there are fast cuts and multiple angles on single actions,
which is a Tony thing. Then the action makes the film feel completely like
a Tony film. Though Ridley did a good job with the action, later on in the
film, he dropped into the shaky-camera cinematography. For those of you
that don't know, I'm somewhat annoyed to see action scenes shot with a
shaky camera, although sometimes it works really well, Ridley seemed to
overuse it late in the film. Combine the shaky-camera with the
unintentional zooming, and the action scenes seem to feel more contrived
than they do panicky.
Overall, G.I. Jane should be seen as an action film more than a drama. Demi
Moore does a good job with her role, but Viggo Mortensen does her one
better. Though this is not a very strong Ridley Scott film, it is still
entertaining. I hope that Ridley can put out a stronger film soon, on the
vein of Alien, Blade Runner, or Thelma and Louise.

Review for Se7en (1995)
There are films that try to scare by going for the gratuitous gore and the
all out disgusting scenes.  David Fincher (Aliens 3) goes a different route
with SE7EN.  Se7en is a film about a serial killer.  This serial killer is
smart, intelligent, and wants to say something to the public.  He wants to
preach to the public about the Seven Deadly sins: Gluttony, Greed, Sloth,
Envy, Wrath, Pride, and Lust.  The way he wants to preach is different than
most.
He murders people using a deadly sin as the method of murder.  For
instance, the first murder a obese man is forced to eat until his stomach
bursts open and hemorrhages internally.  He uses this to preach gluttony.
And for each day of the week, he illustrates one sin with one murder.
Following the case is the almost retiring Detective William Somerset
(Morgan Freeman) and the newbie Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt).  With
these strange murders, Fincher could have gone all the way and just showed
everything, but he stays away from that.  Instead he takes the quiet
approach and forces the audience to imagine how some of the murders took
place.  This is far scarier than doing it with gratuitous gore.  Most of
the murders are scene after they have been committed, usually in pictures,
and sometimes in person.  But, the murders themselves are not shown.
There are a few interesting things to watch for when watching Se7en.  Se7en
was shot on a special, more expensive, film that gives a high contrast
between lights and dark.  This gives a strange eerie look and feel to the
film.  There are many scenes where Somerset and Mills are working in a
darkroom with only flashlights and this makes for some pretty scary scenes.
 The opening credits are also very interesting.  They look like they were
carved straight onto the film.  And with this strange look and a remix of
Nine Inch Nails' "Closer" song, this makes for one of the most creative
opening credits I've ever scene.  The serial killer, for whose name I won't
tell, is the most interesting of all.  The actor that portrays him is the
perfect actor for this role.  Quiet, intelligent looking, and just insane.
The ending of the movie will surprise most.  My sister predicted it, but
she does that a lot.  Se7en should be seen in a dark room with all lights
turn off and all disturbances pushed away.  This film will scare you with
the pure thought of how and why the murders were done.  The ending is
satisfying, but don't expect anything happy.

Review for Dante's Peak (1997)
Lately there have been a string of special effects driven movies that
are lacking in story and characters.  And Dante's Peak is not unlike
these movies.
If you've seen Twister, you'll know the basics for Dante's Peak.  A
scientist driven by a memory of a loved one lost to the "monster" of
nature.  In Twister the monster was the tornado, and the scientist was
Helen Hunt's character Jo.  In Dante's Peak, the monster is a volcano
and the scientist is Pierce Brosnan's Harry.
But, is that all the coincidence between the two movies?  No, Dante's
Peak also has the rag-tag team of scientists, the red truck, the corny
love story, and the opening scene showing how "the loved one" was
lost.
You might me wondering how a 2 hour movie can be made out of one
volcano blowing.  I know I did.  The movie starts with a bang (pun
intended).  But it quickly slows to a smoldering.  The movie then
spends the next hour building the antagonistic relationship between
Harry and his boss and the love story between Harry and the mayor of
Dante's Peak (Linda Hamilton).  This part is slow going, and had me
looking at my watch.  Then all the sudden Dante's Peak explodes (who
could have predicted that?) and although the action is dry and stale,
there is enough tension to keep the movie going from here on.
On a special effects level, Dante's Peak is incredible.  On a story
level it's nothing more than cold slowing lava.  Is it worth seeing?
If it is a matinee showing, sure, go see it on the big screen for the
special effects.

Review for Fast and the Furious, The (2001)
The Fast and The Furious (2001)
Reviewed by Steve Kong (Reviews@UltraMookie.com)

When I first saw the trailers for The Fast and The Furious I grumbled at 
the thought of the movie. I mean, how much of a movie can someone make out 
of those annoyingly loud Rice Rockets that we see on the streets everyday? 
I wasn't even planning on seeing this movie in the theatres, it was at best 
a movie rental that I could fast forward through.
Am I glad that my younger cousins took me to see this movie in the 
theatres. This movie is everything that the Driving-Ms. Cage-Race-Movie 
"Gone in 60 Seconds" from last summer should have been. The adrenaline 
flows fast and with a wide open throttle in this film. There are only two 
reasons to see The Fast and The Furious: The cars and the stunts.
"What about the story?" you ask. There is one, but it's only really there 
to glue together some of the best driving stunt work I've seen in a long 
time. The story goes something like this: A cop (Paul Walker) goes 
undercover to infiltrate a gang of street racers lead by a guy (Vin 
Diesel). This gang leader could also be the leader of a gang of people who 
rob trucks full of electronic goodies in order to pay for car upgrades. 
There's also a love story that happens between the cop and the gang 
leader's sister. Not much story, but that's not really what's expected.
Is The Fast and The Furious a bad movie? It is, it's one of those bad 
movies that is so fun to watch that after awhile I feel bad for enjoying it 
so much : ) The comparisons between The Fast and The Furious and last 
summers Gone in 60 Seconds are expected. Whereas The Fast and The Furious 
moves at lighting speed, Gone in 60 Seconds crawls to the finish line. The 
Fast and The Furious is all about the cars and racing. Gone in 60 Seconds 
was self-conscious and wanted to tell and actually good story too. It's too 
bad that Gone in 60 Seconds didn't have a good story to tell. Sure there 
were exotic cars in Gone in 60 Seconds, but we hardly got to see them, 
except for some flashes near the end. And there were car chases in Gone in 
60 Seconds, but only one real car chase that featured a kick ass Shelby at 
the end of the film - not much of a pay off for sitting through a long 
laborious film, if you ask me. How does The Fast and The Furious compare? 
Like night and day. There are car chases throughout. We get to see the 
actual cars, which were pretty damn impressive, throughout the film (I 
loved the Toyota Supra the Dodge Charger at the end). The makes of The Fast 
and The Furious know they have no story, so they just pump us up full of 
action. And this strategy works!
Don't go see The Fast and The Furious for the story or the acting. See it 
for the cars and the stunts. You won't be disappointed.

Review for Rainmaker, The (1997)
The Rainmaker is an utterly predictable film. With that said, I have to
tell you that I really loved The Rainmaker. Being predictable is a small
flaw that is easily overlooked because of it being a well-directed,
well-acted, and fun movie.
Having come out of seeing the last courtroom drama, Red Corner, The
Rainmaker comes as a surprise to how it handles the courtroom scenes. Which
is to say the courtroom scenes are put at a minimum while the personal side
of the lawyers is shown more. This easily takes away most of the cliched
courtroom scenes (the surprise witness, the talking killer, etc) and
introduces a warmth to a courtroom/legal system film.
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is newly out of law school. He joins up with a
firm that is, unbeknownst to him, dirty and is headed up by a scoundrel
lawyer, Bruiser Stone (Mickey Rourke). While in the firm he has two cases
that he continues to pursue from a law workshop, the big one is what the
film concentrates on, but the smaller one is not overlooked either.
The enemy in The Rainmaker is an insurance company. Rudy's first big case
is for a young man with leukemia fighting against the big insurance
company. On the side he has a smaller case of writing a will for an elderly
lady. And while at a hospital trying to field clients he meets and
inevitably falls in love with a married and abused woman (Claire Daines).
All these plot lines work well together during the film, and each touch the
other in one way or another.
As the cops and a Federal probe gets closer and closer to Rudy's dirty boss
Bruiser, Rudy and Deck (Danny DeVito) take a wad of cash that Bruiser gives
them and they start up their own law firm. What is nice is that the
courtroom scenes are not "played up" for drama. Ford Coppola actually lets
the two, Rudy and Deck, act nervous in court, and this puts a good
down-to-earth spin to the courtroom scenes.
There is an added touch of comic relief that is added to The Rainmaker this
makes the movie so much better than the average courtroom drama. The
Rainmaker is not a comedy in any sense, but Ford Coppola is able to insert
these small moments to get a laugh out of the audience.
There are some pretty big names in this film and they go from small parts
to big parts. There are three big name stars in The Rainmaker that I loved
the best. The first is a major role and that is Danny DeVito as Deck, the
legal assistant to Rudy. Deck has tried the bar exam six times, but has yet
to pass. Though at times it seems that Deck knows more than Rudy, who has
passed the bar. DeVito gives a great performance in The Rainmaker. The
second big name performance that I loved was that of Danny Glover as the
judge Tyrone Kipler. Though Glover's part is small, he does a wonderful job
with it, and he is just a joy to see on the screen again (I last saw him in
Switchback). Last but not least is Jon Voight as the high paid scummy lead
lawyer serving for the insurance company. Voight who I last saw overacting
in the horrible Most Wanted, redeems himself here in The Rainmaker. His
performance as the lead lawyer, Leo F. Drummond, is brilliant, and you can
just seem the slim dripping off of him.
But, the real star of The Rainmaker is Matt Damon as Rudy. Damon gives a
wonderful performance as Rudy and as the film is setup he has a lot of
performing to do. His part is the center of the film, and the film is
basically a character study of his character. Damon does wonderfully in his
part, and I hope to see him in more films soon.
The music by Elmer Bernstein is strange, but it most definitely fits the
movie in most places. It changes moods constantly and consistently with the
action on the screen, but for me the score sometimes sounded out of place.
After seeing a slew of bad films this fall, I'm happy to say that The
Rainmaker is great movie. It is highly entertaining and though somewhat
flawed it shouldn't be missed because it is well-directed, well-acted, and
just plain fun. Don't Miss this film.

Title
Review for Speed (1994)
Speed is a slam bang flashy and fun action film.
The premise? There's a bomb on a bus, if the bus speed drops below 50 mph
the bomb goes off. The premise is pretty simply and on paper it seems
pretty ludicrous. But, onscreen, it works very well building some fun and
highly tense scenes.
The movie starts us off with an energetic action sequence in an elevator
shaft that will make you fear elevators for a long time to come. A mad
bomber (Dennis Hopper) has taken the people in the elevator hostage and it
is up to two LAPD SWAT members to save these people. The two cops are Jack
Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels). After the situation
is "resolved" I was exhausted from the tension and action, but that's not
it! We now get to the part about the bus. It looks like Jack has made the
mad bomber very angry and the mad bomber is going to take it out his
frustrations (is that it?) on another bunch of hostages.
A bus is rigged with a bomb. The bomb will arm itself when the bus passes
50mph and will explode if the bus speed goes below 50mph. Jack, the
inventive one, finds a way to get on the bus and he now has to save these
people from the bomb. The bus sequence is suitibly solved by Jack and his
SWAT team members and I though the movie was over. After the bus sequence,
I was truly worn out, but Yost and de Bont don't stop yet! There's more,
and this all works out for the best. There is an additional action sequence
on a subway train! (If this all sounds like one of those TV infomercials,
"AND THERE'S MORE!", the movie does not run that long -- or at least it
doesn't feel that long.)
The script is by Graham Yost and that explains the silliness of the plot.
In the Yost tradition, Speed is definitely high concept but because it has
a talented rookie director behind the camera, Speed works very well. The
talented rookie director was Jan de Bont (Speed 2: Cruise Control,
Twister). De Bont, previous to directing Speed, worked as a
cinematographer, most notably with John Mc Tiernan on Die Hard and Hunt For
Red October. It looks like de Bont has learned something while working on
those films and it shows in Speed.
Speed follows the three main characters, Annie, Jack and Howard. Annie's
the down-to-earth next-door-neighbour girl type. She is one of the few
characters trapped on the bus. And she is one of the only characters on the
bus that is somewhat fleshed out. Jack is the LAPD guy who has to stop the
bomb. Dennis Hopper plays Howard Payne, the mad bomber, with a vengeance.
The great thing about Speed is that it gets you started with a bang and
never lets up. The movie moves quickly and efficiently from action sequence
to action sequence giving us a breathless ride that makes us forget about
all the things that are silly about the story.
Keanu Reeves is great as Jack Traven. Reeves makes for a good believable
action hero. His character is not given too much in order of showing an
acting range, but Reeves works well with the material he is given. I would
enjoy seeing Reeves in more action roles like this. Sandra Bullock is very
likeable as Annie. She has a lot of onscreen charisma and it makes the
movie all that more fun to watch. Hopper is eery and creepy as Harry Payne.
His performance is way over-the-top, but it is also fun to watch.
After you finish watching Speed you'll be worn out from the sheer energetic
approach that Jan de Bont employs to direct Speed. Sure, there is a lot of
silliness going on in Speed, but who cares? Speed is one of the most fun
films to watch. Don't Miss Speed!

Title
Review for Out of Sight (1998)
George Clooney's last few big screen expeditions range from mediocre
(Peacemaker) to outright awful (Batman and Robin). Clooney is a good actor
and really does deserve more. Is Out of Sight the movie that will make him
a superstar?
Based on the Elmore Leonard book by the same name, the movie follows a bank
robber with a heart of gold, Jack Foley (Clooney), and federal marshal
Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez). Foley is an intelligent, charming, and
big-time bank robber who has robbed so many banks that he's lost count.
With all of this, the only thing setting him back is his problem with cars.
Sisco is a hard-nosed federal marshal who on a routine trip to the Glades
Correctional facility in Florida runs into Foley trying to breakout of the
same correctional facility.
The two have instant chemistry - both as characters and as on-screen
actors. But, therein lies the problem - how can a federal officer be
interested in a guy who she knows clearly broke out of prison? What will
she do if she meets him again? Will she put him back in the slammer? Will
they run away together?
Out of Sight is the third Leonard based film I've seen, along with Touch
and Get Shorty. Out of Sight is my favourite of the three. The combination
of a densely plotted script, believable characters, great acting, and
wonderful music makes Out of Sight a movie that can't be missed.
This is going to be the sleeper hit of the summer. As a movie that hasn't
been overly advertised and has more story than special effects, Out of
Sight will make a big draw with the people that want to see a funny and
intelligent film during the summer. This is going to be the movie that
makes George Clooney a superstar.
Clooney loses all his neck and head twitches that he uses in ER and adopts
a more confident style for Out of Sight. This time his character is not
Doctor Ross in a different environment. Clooney's character is not the
typical criminal with a heart of gold, though. Most criminals we see with a
heart of gold are bumbling idiots and not intelligent. Foley though is
intelligent; watch how he takes care of different situations: The first
bank robbery that we see, the prison library incident, and the prison
escape all show how this guy thinks.
Lopez is in every way Clooney's equal. Lopez's acting is superb. Her
character, Sisco, is a tough federal marshal who has a soft side - she
takes no crap from anyone, makes her own decisions, and sticks to them.
Watch how she reacts to these different situations: dealing with the
brother of a convict, dealing with Foley, and dealing with a drug addict.
Among the supporting cast, there is a lot to like. Ving Rhames as Buddy,
Jack Foley's only friend, is wonderful. He plays his character with a sense
of vulnerability that you don't often find in a car-jacker. Dennis Farina
as Karen's father is hilarious. I love what he did when he met with Karen's
boyfriend (a surprise cameo by Michael Keaton). Albert Brooks is good in
his role as a white-collar-criminal. The only performance I didn't like -
and this maybe because he's playing against what I'm used to seeing him as
- is Don Cheadle as a vicious gangster criminal.
Given that this is the summer season, I'd expect a lot of movies to be
visually arresting. And so far all of the movies that I've seen are quite
visual. But, not of them have what, surprisingly to me, George Clooney's
new film Out of Sight has: visual style. The style used in Out of Sight is
useful, beautiful, and jarring. I loved the visual style of the film. The
director, Steven Soderbergh, and cinematographer, Elliot Davis, use
different styles of movie making to accomplish a polished film in the end.
I loved how they used the freeze frame repeatedly to imprint the reactions
of the characters in our minds. I've not seen the freeze frame used a lot,
and the only director that uses it this often is my favourite, John Woo.
Also, watch for how the tone of the film changes between the two main
settings. In Florida, the film is warm and full of vibrant color. But, when
the film moves to Detroit, it becomes cold and almost colorless.
Out of Sight is a well-written, funny, and engaging film that will make
George Clooney a superstar. Don't Miss Out of Sight.

Review for She's All That (1999)
I really wanted to dislike She's All That. I didn't even want to see it.
But, I was dragged kicking and screaming into the movie by my teenage
cousins. I'm glad that I saw She's All That. Contrary to my preconceptions
about the film based on the previews, this film was very entertaining.
Zak (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) is the coolest guy at his high school. He's
smart, good looking, and well respected. He's also dating the hottest girl
at the high school. He and she are about to be voted prom king and queen.
Everything seems to be going great for Zak until his girlfriend comes back
from spring break and dumps him for some TV hotshot. On a bet with his
friends, Zak tries to turn the high school loser, Laini (Rachael Leigh
Cook), into a prom queen. The story is somewhat predictable and has been
done before. But, it is done in such a way that it is quite entertaining.
She's All That is a movie aimed square at those who have recently graduated
from high school or are still in high school. I'm not in that range, but I
still found the film quite enjoyable since some of the situations will hit
home for many of us. The film is hip with its music and young actors.
The acting is nothing to write home about. But, it is good enough that it
kept me interested. The script is hilarious, with many laugh out loud
moments. And the writer, Lee Fleming, is able to write some sharp and witty
lines for the characters. This might not be Shakespeare, but it is good
writing worthy of watching.
If you have a free afternoon (and perhaps in that age range I mentioned)
you'll enjoy She's All That. Catch She's All That at a matinee showing.
[Rated PG-13 for sexual content, crude humor, brief strong language and
teen drinking. Running Time: 95 Minutes]

Review for Scream 2 (1997)
"Sequels suck," exclaims one of the characters in Scream 2. But, do they?
After the phenomenal run of Scream, there was no doubt that a sequel would
be produced. One could only hope that the creative team behind Scream would
return for the sequel to create a movie as good or better than the first.
Fortunately, the creative team behind Scream has returned to work on Scream
2. Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson return to make Scream 2.
Scream 2 opens about two years after the events in Scream. The
introduction, not unlike that of Scream, is a short piece that illustrates
the self-mocking ways of Craven and Williamson. Drew Barrymore is replaced
this time by Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps. This opening sequence had a
strange effect on me. It's one thing to scare the audience, but then it is
another thing to completely creep out the audience. The opening sequence
takes place in a darken theatre premiering STAB, a film based on the "true
life" events of Scream, which is also based on the book by Gale Weathers
(Courtney Cox). The creepiness of the prologue comes from it bringing the
horror so close to the audience. It took the horror of the film right into
the theatre, which made me feel scared all the way through the rest of the
film, and I'm pretty sure everyone will also.
After this introduction we get into the meat of the film. Sidney Prescott
(Neve Campbell) is off to Windsor College. As the movie STAB opens to the
public, the body count starts to mount. We are introduced to an ensemble
cast of characters, all who could be the copy-cat murderer. And, from this
point on, the scares are many and the body count rises quickly.
Scream 2 takes from the first in its satirical look at slasher films and
its blatant tongue in cheek events. The characters are unafraid to speak
their minds and the dialogue is sharp, witty and hilarious. It seems that
Williamson can find humor in dialogue in any morbid situation. The dialogue
is filled with pop references and is not afraid to poke fun at some of the
best known people, including two of Cox's "Friends" co-stars, David
Shwimmer and Jennifer Aniston. ("That's just my head pasted on Jennifer
Aniston's body," Weathers exclaims as one character asks her about the nude
pictures of her on the Internet.)
What about the horror part of the film? Craven is at his best here in
Scream 2. There are many scary and thrilling moments including one staged
in a car that had most everyone at the edge of their seats and squirming.
Craven finds the right mix between gore, horror, scares, and humor with
Scream 2.
Williamson redeems himself with the Scream 2 script. His last project, I
KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, was horribly mediocre and not on the same
level as either Scream of Scream 2. Some of this can be accounted for
because of Craven's expertise, but a lot of it is because of Williamson's
creativity in writing the script. The whodunit portion of the film is well
done, though as the film progressed I was able to correctly guess who the
killer was at the end.
Though Neve Campbell is the star of the film it is Courtney Cox who shines.
 Cox is cocky and very hate-able as Gale Weathers, a woman who is always
looking for a good story to promote herself.  Cox is just great in this
role.  This is not to say that Campbell is not good in her role though, she
is also fabulous as Sidney Prescott, the girl who is sick and tired of all
the games that are being played with her life.  David Arquette, as the
returning Dewey, is also really good.  All around, the cast of Scream 2 is
excellent throughout the film.
One thing that I noticed was that there was a bit of recycled music in
Scream 2, which is a small portion of Hans Zimmer's BROKEN ARROW
soundtrack.  They used John Travolta's BROKEN ARROW theme for Dewey, which
at first came off as cheesy to me, but after awhile it did work pretty well.
Craven also has fun with the first film.  Using a movie in a movie
technique that plays the first film for laughs.  I wish Craven had used
more of STAB for laughs.  There are some pretty funny moments in STAB,
including a hilarious cameo by Tori Spelling.
Scream 2 is definitely a sequel that does not suck.  Craven and Williamson
have done a great job with this movie and it is admirable that they can mix
the thriller with an outright self-mocking comedy without losing the edge.
They are able to scare us one second then make us laugh out loud the next.
This is a fun, scary, and humorous film that shouldn't be missed in the
theatre.  It will have you on the edge of your seat for most of the film.
Don't miss Scream 2.

Review for Siege, The (1998)
A while ago, I saw an interview with ex-X-Files writers Glen Morgan and
James Wong. In the interview, Morgan and Wong, who wrote some of the most
memorable episodes of the show, were asked how they came up with some of
their bizarre ideas. The two looked at each other and answered with a short
story. What they did when out of ideas was look out their office window and
just ask, "what if?" about something ordinary. From there the two start
asking "what if?" about things related and that's how they spin the tales
that they do. This sounds like the same technique The Siege writers took
when they wrote the movie.
What if terrorists started terrorizing New York? What if the terrorists
were Arabs? What if society started turning against Arabs? What if Arabs
were taken and locked into concentration camps? What if the US law
enforcement agencies could not handle the terrorist activities? What if the
US Army was called in to handle the terrorists? What if you lost your
freedom and your civil liberties?
For the first two-thirds of The Siege, it was a wonderfully entertaining
film. This portion of the film follows FBI agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel
Washington) and Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub) as they try to track down the
terrorists bombing New York City. This part of the film shows crackling
good hard-boiled detective work. The two meet a suspicious CIA agent, Elise
Kraft (Annette Bening), who may or may not be on their side.
The exact point when The Siege falls apart is easy to spot; it's when Bruce
Willis enters the film. I like Willis as an actor, and his acting is not
the reason The Siege starts to unravel. The character that Willis portrays
ruins the film. General William Devereaux is in charge of the Army presence
that is brought into New York City to shut it down and squeeze until the
terrorists come out. I'm not sure what happened, but it seemed that the
writers at this point just ran out of ideas. From this point on everything
is contrived, including the awful ending.
Ultimately, the major failings of The Siege is that it strives to be
politically correct. Because the filmmakers did not want to offend anyone,
The Siege ends up alienating everyone. The writers, Lawrence Wright, Menno
Meyjes, and Edward Zwick, know they are going to take heat for portraying
Arabs as terrorists, so they also write about Arabs who are taken into
interment camps. The problem is that the writers deal with both the
terrorists and prisoners at arms-length. We never get to know or feel for a
prisoner and we never get to know or feel for why the terrorists are doing
what they're doing. The script turns the Arab people into a lumped group of
"they" or "them" instead of having characters that we can relate to.
I was somewhat disappointed in The Siege when I look back and see the
powerful movies that have come from the collaboration between director
Zwick and actor Washington, such as Glory and Courage Under Fire. The Siege
does not reach the heights that these movies obtained.
The performances are all top-notch; even that of Bruce Willis. Washington,
as always, is intense and believable onscreen. He is given a few speeches
where he shows just how good of an actor he is - including a speech near
the end of the film where he talks about freedom and the Constitution.
Bening is good as the ever unclear, good or bad, CIA agent Elise Kraft.
The one performance that I enjoyed - even more than Washington's - is Tony
Shalhoub's performance. Shalhoub is able to switch, effortlessly, between
serious and playfully comic. Where Willis is too serious, Washington too
uptight, and Bening too crafty, Shalhoub is level and sane. Shalhoub brings
both humor and humanity to his character. Kudos to Tony Shalhoub for his
splendid performance in The Siege; he made the film watchable.
But, in the end, The Siege falls into mediocrity because it's not brave
enough to take a stance. Instead, The Siege wanders and tries to please
everyone, but fails miserably. Catch The Siege on video for the
performances of Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, and Tony
Shalhaub.

Review for As Good As It Gets (1997)
As Good As It Gets is a wonderful "feel good" movie. The wonderful part of
As Good As It Gets is that it is a "feel good" movie about a rotten guy.
Melvin (Jack Nicholson) is an obsessive-compulsive guy who whenever he
opens his mouth spews an insult. Melvin is an accomplished author, but
there's no helping this guy, is there? The thing that starts a chain of
events that changes Melvin is a cute scene stealing dog. Melvin is a
homophobic person, so he dislikes his neighbour, a gay painter, Simon (Greg
Kinnear). And when the film opens, Melvin (a very reclusive man) also hates
Simon's dog. But, after some things happen, Melvin is stuck with Simon's
dog, which starts the changing of Melvin. And Melvin starts to take
interest in Carol (Helen Hunt) the waitress at the restaurant where Melvin
eats all the time.
Jack Nicholson is just hilarious as the poison-tongued Melvin. Nicholson is
about to portray Melvin as a guy who just can't say something good, but we
can all see that he really does want to. Helen Hunt is also great as Carol,
the waitress who is really doesn't know what to do with Melvin. Carol seems
to understand Melvin and unlike others, she has a good temperance and is
patient with Melvin. Simon has his own troubles and we see how the Melvin
changes slowly and begins to accept Simon more. Greg Kinnear gives a good
performance as Simon. Worth mentioning is Cuba Gooding Jr. who is Frank,
Simon's art dealer, and watch for Gooding Jr.'s performance.
What surprised me a bit was the score for the film. The score comes from
Hans Zimmer, and it is, at least to me, something completely different from
what he's done before. The score is light but very likeable. It is
different from his other scores in that it isn't a pulse pounding score. It
is rather good and different from his last few scores which sounded the
same (The Peacemaker, The Rock, and Broken Arrow.)
As Good As It Gets is a bit long, but, it is entertaining enough not to put
anyone to sleep. The thing that drives As Good As It Gets is the
characters. The characters are well written and I just wanted to see what
they were going to do or say next. The story is somewhat predictable, but
that's OK, the characters are good enough to carry the film. As Good As It
Gets got me to laugh out loud quite a few times, and it was from
Nicholson's performance. He is the one to see the movie for.

Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
Saving Private Ryan is a haunting and moving movie that will live in my
head for a long time to come. There are good movies that come around only
once in a long time and Saving Private Ryan is one of those. 
I never write a review immediately after seeing a movie. I like to let the
movie sink in for a day or two before setting out to write the review.
After Saving Private Ryan, I'm sitting here two hours later writing the
review. The movie is so unsettling that I feel that writing this review
might help me come to grips with some of what happened during the film. 
Saving Private Ryan opens with a 30-minute sequence of the Omaha Beach
D-Day invasion; this is a war sequence is so realistic and raw that I will
be remember it for a long time. I must warn you now, Saving Private Ryan
deserves its R-rating. This is not a movie for young children and if you
are squeamish, you might want to cover your eyes here. The opening sequence
is so extremely violent and realistic that it not only leaves you
breathless, but it leaves you unnerved and senseless. I have not seen
anything like this before and I doubt that I will see anything close
anytime soon. Spielberg shoots this opening sequence with such intensity
that I was left to wonder why all these unnecessary atrocities were committed.
What we find out is that three brothers from the Ryan house were killed
during the war, and all three telegrams are being delivered to the mother
on the same day. However, there is a fourth still in the war. A group of
eight soldiers led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is sent out into the
middle of the war to find Private James F. Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him
home to his family. The journey is long and hard, and about halfway through
the film I was already reeling.
Those of you who read my reviews know that I rarely cry at movies. And even
when I do cry, it usually comes at the end. Saving Private Ryan is the
first movie where I found myself crying halfway through. There are many war
movies, and many of them are about the Second World War. But, most all of
them are candy coated.
Spielberg takes the gloss out of the war; he strips the war down to its
most natural form, and he shoots this war from the point of view of a
soldier. Having done this, Spielberg has made less of a war movie and more
of an anti-war movie. Saving Private Ryan left me wondering why we fight wars.
Is there anything to criticize about Saving Private Ryan? No. In every
sense, this is a perfect movie. Spielberg, who pumped out some mediocre
stuff lately (Lost World, Amistad), comes back strong with Saving Private
Ryan. This movie will make my top ten list this year, and will likely be
the number one film on the list.
Things to note about Saving Private Ryan range from the score to the
acting. The score by the ever-talented John Williams is just as raw as the
film is. It takes our emotions and leads us in all the right directions,
all the while not being overly melodramatic or distracting.
The acting is top-notch, from the leads (Tom Hanks and Tom Sizemore) to the
supporting cast (Matt Damon, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg,
and Barry Pepper). Spielberg is able to get great performances out of
everyone onscreen. 
Kudos to Robert Rodat for writing this powerful and moving movie. Kudos
also to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski for shooting this film in the way
that it is. The film is not a colorful film, nor is it bright. Kaminski
strips the colors out of the film leaving us with just enough colors to
live with, leaving us feeling slightly uncomfortable. Kaminski's work is
some of the best I've seen this year. Pay close attention to detail during
the first thirty minutes or so. That shows just how good Kaminski is.
Saving Private Ryan is one of the most shocking and memorable films of this
year - and of this decade. There is imagery from this film that I will
never forget and there are characters that will haunt my memory forever.
This is a motion picture that doesn't make war look like a glorious thing;
it shows war as it is, a stupid thing. Don't Miss Saving Private Ryan.

Review for Mystery, Alaska (1999)
Dear David E. Kelley, if this is all you can do on the big screen, please 
stick to the small screen.  It's not that Mystery, Alaska is a terrible 
film Mr. Kelley, rather is a little to plain and thin on conflict.  See, 
Mr. Kelley, I an avid fan of your TV shows.  I loved your Picket Fences, I 
watch Ally McBeal every week, and the best of your shows, The Practice, I 
make time just to watch it.  What makes and made these shows so 
good?  Sharp writing, a sense of direction, and conflict.  Mr. Kelley 
you've done so well with your words every week on the small screen, what's 
up with doing the same on the big screen?
First you churn on the terrible Lake Placid which isn't worth even the 
rent, hell, how did it get made in the first place?  Then you turn out this 
quaint film, Mystery, Alaska about a small fictitious town named Mystery in 
Alaska where it's always covered in snow and the people there always ice 
skate around.  The people of the town are quaint just like the movie.  You 
got your quaint sheriff who loves to play hockey, John Biebe (Russell 
Crowe), and his quaint wife, Donna (Mary McCormack).  You got your quaint 
mayor played by Colm Meaney.  You even got Burt Reynolds in the film as a 
mean judge.  But, you know what Mr. Kelley?  Everything is just too nice in 
this film.  Sure, there are people who look like they're the bad guys, like 
Charles Danner (Hank Azaria) who comes back to his home town with the New 
York Rangers to challenge the home team at a game of hockey  this is 
because the home team is so good at hockey that they've been featured in 
ESPN.  But, the bad guys, well they're quite nice also.
What we have here, Mr. Kelley, is a film that meanders around for 90 
minutes then ends.  Not much but a lot of nice people going about their 
nice lives.  Not much entertainment value either.  It's hard to do this to 
you Mr. Kelley, but for the second time this year, I'm giving one of your 
films a Skip, Skip, Skip label because it's not worth seeing.  I beg you 
Mr. Kelley, bring some of that small screen magic that you bring to Ally 
McBeal and The Practice every week onto your big screen projects, else stay 
on the small screen.

Title
Review for eXistenZ (1999)
Hollywood always seems to release movies that are similar to each other 
back-to-back or near back-to-back.  Take for instance the mad-bomber phase 
when Hollywood released both Speed (good) and Blown Away (bad) 
together.  Or when the animated bugs took the screen with A Bug's Life 
(good) and Antz (good also).  Well, in 1999 there was a phase when 
Hollywood decided to release two movies about alternate or externally 
generated realities together.  The first was a hit, and I loved it, it was 
The Matrix.  The second I skipped and waited for DVD and that was 
eXistenZ.  I finally got to see eXistenZ on DVD, am I glad I waited.
eXistenZ is the name of a virtual reality game developed over some five 
years by the world's most famous and best game developer, Allegra Gellar 
(Jennifer Jason Leigh).  After an attempt on her life, she is on the run 
and is being protected by a PR geek named Ted Pikul (Jude Law).  In order 
to save her game, she has to go into it and play  why she has to play the 
game in order to save it, I don't know and I don't remember the movie tell 
me either.  So, she and Ted Pikul enter eXistenZ to play the game and save it.
Unlike most virtual reality or alternative reality movies, eXistenZ takes a 
different approach to "jacking in."  Instead of the standard fare of 
plugging into a computer, eXistenZ resides on an organic thing  it's hard 
to describe, but, in the movie it looks like a melted rubber mask from some 
monster movie that moves and makes little noises that you might expect out 
of a doll.  The organic pod is plugged into the game player via a bio-port 
located at the bottom of the players back and it gets plugged directly into 
the player's spine.  All of this is good and fine, it's actually pretty 
innovative.
What's not to like about this movie?  Well, to start off, I think director 
David Cronenberg has some sort of fetish with alien flesh or raw 
carcass.  I was disgusted by most of the movie (not to mention I lost my 
appetite when I watched the Chinese restaurant sequence).  Cronenbery just 
piles on the flesh, bones, and carcass throughout the movie and it reaches 
a point where I just said to myself, "Aw, this is complete crap."
It doesn't help that the script is completely predictable.  The idea behind 
the script is standard fare when it comes to stories about alternate 
realities.  It is much like The Matrix's in that it leads the viewers 
through some alternate realities and then leaves the viewer to wonder what 
reality the characters are really in.  Are they still in some alternate 
reality?  Or are they in the "real" world"?  Well, although both eXistenZ 
and The Matrix are predictable in that sense, at least The Matrix had some 
intriguing ideas behind it (albeit a little stupid like the 
humans-as-batteries idea) and it had some kick-ass action sequences to 
boot.  eXistenZ had neither.  The movie is about carcass about flesh.  It's 
about two people wandering through something that at any given point if 
they were killed, I wouldn't give a damn.  The story is so thin that I 
wondered halfway through the movie what the point of them playing the game 
was  and like I said before, that was never explained.
The main actors Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh wander through the movie 
like their characters.  Maybe they were just doing it for the extra cash, I 
can only hope they were.  Especially for Jude Law who gave such a wonderful 
performance in another sci-fi film Gattaca, it was disappointing to see him 
in such schlock as eXistenZ.  Leigh does what she can with her part, which 
is a part that has no excitement, no real character.
I've never been a fan of eXistenZ writer/director David Cronenberg and 
eXistenZ does not help to move me into his fan club either.  Cronenberg is 
one of those auteur directors who love to do things differently, which I 
have nothing against.  Some of the best directors go against the grain of 
Hollywood and make some of the best and most innovative films.  But, 
Cronenberg seems to try way too hard at it.  He tries to be way too 
different.  Maybe he's making the film for himself, I don't know, but 
eXistenZ was not entertaining at all.  It was predictable and 
disgusting.  I wonder how Cronenberg got the green light on this project.
So, was there anything that I did like about this movie?  Yes, only one 
thing.  That was the haunting score by Howard Shore (The Game).  Howard 
composes a wonderful score that is wasted on a terrible movie.
Skip eXistenZ, save an hour and a half of your time.  This film is just 
garbage that's not worth watching.  If you want an alternative-reality film 
fix, then go rent The Matrix.  Or if you want a film that will screw with 
your head about a different reality then go rent an older film named 
Jacob's Ladder.  eXistenZ is like a lot of the mutant animals in the film, 
an ugly mutated version of something that could have been beautiful.  Skip 
eXistenZ.

Title
Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)
Some say the ultimate flattery is in imitation.  With movies, though, I say
stay away from sequels -- even if they are quasi-sequels like US Marshals.
US Marshals is a semi-sequel to the 1993 blockbuster thriller "The
Fugitive" which starred Harrison Ford.  Tommy Lee Jones had a big
supporting role that turned him up an Oscar.  In US Marshals we move the
focus from the escapee to the hunter: US Marshal Sam Gerard.
In The Fugitive we were introduced to Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) who was
a simple but very intelligent man.  It was Gerald's striving for hard work
-- from both himself and his team -- that made for such an exciting movie.
Tommy Lee Jones revives his portrayal of Gerard for US Marshals.  This time
he's chasing another escaped fugitive.  But, this time there's no real
thrill to the chase.
US Marshals opens with a completely contrived action sequence that
accomplishes nothing.  The film opens with Jones in a big bright yellow
chicken suit, staking out a really bad guy.  How do we know the guy is
really bad?
He wears black leather, dirty jeans, has tattoos, earrings, and his woman
has real big hair.  A fight breaks out, the bad guy is caught, and Gerard
and his team celebrate.  We then switch over to a tow-truck operator
(Wesley Snipes) who has an unfortunate accident, gets arrested, gets bailed
out by his girlfriend (Irene Jacob), and then gets arrested again.
We find out that Snipes's character is suspected of murdering two
government agents in "cold blood." He vehemently denies it and says that
it's a simple case of mistaken identity.  Oh sure, we're supposed to
believe that. 
Snipes is really a super-operative for a deeply covert government agency
called the DSS, named Sheridan.  We find out that Sheridan is really a
highly trained killing Marine -- heck, who in a Hollywood flick isn't? --
and he is a hot commodity with the DSS now.
Sheridan is being transported to jail by plane.  By coincidence, Gerard is
on the same plane.  A failed assassination attempt on Sheridan's life
results in a plane crash and that is where only one prisoner escapes;  you
guessed right, Sheridan escapes.  And if you guessed that Gerard is on the
chase, well, you guess right again.
The setup for the film, up until the plane crash, takes a horrendous thirty
or so minutes.  Most of those thirty minutes were wasted  and strange,
useless padding.  I was relieved to see the action picking up after the
plane crash but was disappointed by the slow pace  which followed.
When the chase starts, Gerald's team gets an unwanted addition: a DSS agent
named Royce (Robert Downey Jr.)  As with all predictable movies, we all
know why Royce is really on the team and what his overall status in the
movie will turn out to be.
US Marshals is a movie about waste.  Wasted time for the more than two-hour
running time and an endless cascade of needless scenes.  Wasted talent for
casting good actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Robert Downey Jr.,
Irene Jacob and Joe Pantoliano in such mediocre roles.  And a wasted sequel
for having a script that is not original but simply makes minor changes to
the original film and passes it off as a new film.
US Marshals is tries very hard to be The Fugitive Part II, with action
sequences that come close to mirroring sequences in The Fugitive -- the
plane crash for the train crash, the leap of a building to a train for the
leap of a dam -- and a story line that tries to be the same.  What is
missing in US Marshals is two things: the steady hand of a good director
and the steady pen of a good writer.
When I heard that Stuart Baird was at the helm of this film, directing, I
had a sick queasy feeling in my stomach.  I know as a film critic I should
go into films with an open mind, but I'm human.  Baird, who did some
wonderful editing with films like Superman, the first two Lethal Weapons,
and Die Hard 2, became a director with Executive Decision.  It was a
generic and bland action film.  I feared that Baird would also turn US
Marshals into the same type of generic and bland flavor of film, and my
fears were all proven correct.  I really don't understand why the pacing of
US Marshals was so awful.  It was slow and the action sequences were badly
put together.  The slow pace makes for too much time for the audience to
think of the silliness of the plot.  The bad editing and filming of the
action sequences fail to create the much-needed adrenaline rush for an
action film.  Throw in a dash of unneeded government conspiracies and we
have the making of a dud action film.
The script is unintelligent and confusing.  Writer John Pogue puts together
a script that is unnecessarily talky and reinvents the characters as
forgetful puppets.  Gerard finds out halfway through the film that Sheridan
didn't commit the crimes but still goes on chasing after Sheridan.  Why?
US Marshals could have been better.   The main failing of the film is that
the audience is never emotionally attached to Sheridan.  In The Fugitive we
were with Harrison Ford's character all the way.  We felt for the guy and
we wanted him to prevail.  When the focus of the film switches from the
pursued to the pursuer we lose this connection.  And with the premise of
the film being that Sheridan is innocent, we don't want Gerard to catch
him, so there is no connection whatsoever.
Snipes is reduced to portraying a guy on the run.  Every time he has screen
time he is running.  Jones is reduced to a standard-fare action hero.
Every time he has screen time he is chasing.  Had US Marshals been a bit
tighter in the story line and the editing, this would have been fine.  But,
the fact remains that US Marshals tries to be a thriller without thrilling.
It was funny for me to see Snipes and Downey on screen together again --
especially in a hospital.  The last time they were together onscreen was in
One Night Stand.
Some sequels work out well (Empire Strikes Back, Scream 2) and some don't.
US Marshals falls into the latter category.  With a silly script and an
amateur director, time is wasted along with talent.  Yes, there are some
slick stunts in US Marshals and there are some exciting portions, but the
time you spend to get to them is not justified.  Skip US Marshals at the
theatres.  It's a shame that this sequel was made.

Review for Dangerous Beauty (1998)
You find out from the man that you love that he cannot marry you.  Why?
Because you are in a different economic class than he is and your father
has spent your entire dowry.  So, what's a girl to do?  Become an
over-priced, well-educated prostitute for the rich, of course.  Then you
can accomplish three things: get yourself some high pleasure, make some
money for your family, and--the most important--make that man that you love
mighty jealous.
That is the basic story line for Dangerous Beauty, the second film starring
Rufus Sewell I've screened in less than a week.  Of course the girl,
Veronica Franco (Catherine McCormack), is not called an "over-price
well-educated prostituted" in the film; Franco is actually called a
courtesan.  She becomes a courtesan like her mother (Jacqueline Bisset)
before her for the main reason to earn money for the family.  But, we all
know that she's also doing it to make the man that she loves, Marco Venier
(Rufus Sewell), jealous and to find that opportune time to spend with him.
Veronica meets many men as a courtesan and one of them discovers her
talent; she is a gifted poet.  She befriends Marco's uncle, Domenico Venier
(Fred Ward), who is a rich man and is willing to publish her works.  There
are a few subplot lines that run through the film, including one about the
jealousy of Marco's cousin, Maffio (Oliver Platt), over Veronica's
published works.  Don't let these small details slip; they will come back
later.
Dangerous Beauty starts off telling the audience that it is a movie based
on a true story, I'm not familiar with the story of Veronica Franco so I
can't say if it's true to life or not.  The movie itself is very
entertaining.  It has two things that kept my attention: the beautiful
cinematography and the gorgeous and talented Catherine McCormack.
The cinematography, sets, and all-around look of Dangerous Beauty are
breath taking.  Cinematographer Bojan Bazelli films Dangerous Beauty with a
fuzzy lens that makes everything very soft.  But along with this, take note
of the changes of colors that follow the changes of moods during the film.
There are two very distinct looks.  One is the golden bright look when
Venice is doing well and the other is the dark blue look when Venice has
fallen into trouble.
The performances are generally good, but it is Catherine (Braveheart)
McCormack's that lights up the screen.  She does a wonderful job with her
part of the courtesan that is supposed to love only the pleasure that comes
from her job.  Rufus Sewell does well also onscreen; Sewell and McCormack
have definite chemistry, which helps the film.  Whenever the two are
onscreen together the sparks are flying.  I hope to see McCormack in more
films soon.
The script by Jeannine Dominy, based on the book The Honest Courtesan by
Margaret Rosenthal, is entertaining enough to hold our attention.  It is
not quite a gripping script but there are moments when we are completely
caught up with what is happening in the film--look for the two poetry
contests between Veronica and Maffio.  Though there are those moments that
run a bit long and we are left to look at our watches.  The pacing of the
film is a bit uneven, but this is a small flaw.
Dangerous Beauty is an extremely entertaining film that benefits from the
beauty and acting of Catherine McCormack.  Though the pacing is a bit
uneven and some of the lines performed seem out of place, those are small
flaws in the overall view of this film.  Don't Miss Dangerous Beauty in the
theatres.

Review for Beach, The (2000)
The Beach is a highly entertaining film that falls prey to Hollywood in the 
end.
Let me start off first by saying that cinematographer Darius Khondji does a 
godlike job at shooting this film. Khondji shoots everything with a sense 
of grandeur and even if you don't enjoy the film, you can still watch The 
Beach for its postcard views.
In The Beach, we follow world traveler, Richard (Leo DiCaprio). Richard is 
on a trip to Bankok, Thailand. He is given a map to a perfect beach by a 
man known own as Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle). So, being a free soul, 
Richard heads out to find this perfect beach. He asks his two neighbours in 
the hotel if they would like to join him, and they do. So, Richard, 
Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen), and Étienne (Guillaume Canet) set off on a 
journey to find paradise.
What they find is an island that is perfect, but has its own little 
secrets. On one side of the island are a group of men harvesting marijuana 
and on the other a small community that lives peacefully in what could 
easily be called paradise. The community is lead by a magnetic Sal (Tilda 
Swinton) who will do anything to keep the community a secret.
As acting goes, DiCaprio does well in the film. Though, the portion of the 
film where he goes through his madness really taxes our suspension of 
disbelief. But, DiCaprio does prove that he's not just a pretty face on 
screen and that he can actually act. Canet does well with his limited role 
as the Frenchman Étienne who is in the middle of a love triangle with 
Richard. The real surprise is Ledoyen who turns in a wonderful performance.
Direction by Danny Boyle is steady and he gets what he can out of the 
script by John Hodge (adapted from the novel by Alex Garland). This is not 
Boyle's best film.
The Beach has a great premise and explores some good issues  can paradise 
really be on Earth and what would you do to keep it perfect? But, by the 
climax of the film, everything has been put aside to end the film with a 
very Hollywood style ending. I would have liked to see something more 
substantive as an ending. As it stands, The Beach is a highly entertaining 
and beautiful film that is marred only by a shoddy ending.

Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Alien: Resurrection takes its roots from the second film in this 18 year
old film series. Resurrection is more of an action film than anything and
as an action film Resurrection works very well.
For those of you who don't want to know how Ripley comes back from the dead
-- those that don't remember, Ripley dove to her death in Alien 3 -- skip
this next paragraph and go to the next one. When I saw the trailers for
Alien: Resurrection I wondered how they would bring Ripley back from the
dead. But the well-written script by Joss Whedon finds a way to bring her
back that is, though not unique, so simple that it bypassed me. They cloned
Ripley with some blood samples.
To tell you how the aliens come back in this movie will spoil the movie,
but lets just say that the aliens do come back and the are better than
ever. French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet seems to have turned up the goo
level on the aliens though; the spit and the drool are just generally
gooey. Next to this though, Jeunet finds some interesting ways to show how
intelligent these creatures really are. An example to look for is how the
aliens escape.
Sigourney Weaver brings back Ripley, but this time Ripley is different.
Ripley has come back with an attitude and is going to take it out on the
aliens.  Sure, Ripley had an attitude in the last three films, but this
time, it's a huge attitude.  I liked Ripley, but I think Winona Rider's
Call is cooler.  Though Ryder looks so fragile, her Call shows that she can
take a few hits.
As for the other cast members when I first read who was going to be in the
movie I rolled my eyes and said to myself, "They're kidding right?"  But, I
was completely wrong.  The actor that I originally disagreed with most was
Dan Hedaya.  For me, Hedaya has always been a comedic actor, I wondered how
they would fit him into Resurrection.  I'm happy to say, I was all wrong.
Hedaya does well in Resurrection.  The other player that bothered me was
Michael Wincott, but he also does a great job in Resurrection.
Worth mentioning are actor Ron Perlman and the great score by John C.
Frizzell.  Perlman was a joy to watch and his character was pretty funny,
providing a lot of the comic relief in the film with sharp one-liners.
Frizzell's score, though not as good as Horner's score for Aliens, is
admirable.
And one scene that knocked me out of my seat was the underwater scene.
Please look at this scene, I loved it.  I loved how they handled the alien
in the water.  This is a great scene.
The only part that bothered me was the last 15 minutes or so of the film.
The film builds up well, but the ending is somewhat of a let down.  Don't
let this make you skip the movie.  This is a fun and exciting action film
set in the Alien universe.  See it for Weaver, Perlman and especially
Ryder.  Don't miss Alien Resurrection.
On a side note, I noticed that H.R. Giger again got no onscreen credit for
his Alien design.  And although he did not work on this film, the design is
his, and I think that he should have gotten credit for such a wonderful
design.  Please don't forget who created and designed the Alien, one of the
best sci-fi aliens around.  Cheers to H.R. Giger for such a wonderful design.

Title
Review for Cube (1997)
One set, five actors, bad acting, even worse dialogue and a sadistic 
director.  In one sentence that is what the movie Cube is about.  Saying 
that the movie is innovative is only telling half the story.
Five strangers awaken to find themselves stuck in a cubic room.  There are 
six hatches, one on each side, and these hatches lead to other cubic 
rooms.  These rooms are either safe or they are booby-trapped to kill upon 
entering.  Like a good episode of The X-Files, Cube starts off mysteriously 
and then with the original question it develops even more questions.  And 
like the cube that these five are stuck in where every room leads to yet 
another one, every question leads to another.  The audience is left to 
wonder why are the characters there?  What is the reason behind the 
Cube?  How did the characters end up in the Cube?  The level of paranoia in 
the movie rises quickly.  But, this all unravels as the film slows to a 
grind and becomes increasingly more and more boring.
The script is to blame.  The film is innovative, I mean, how many films 
have you seen that have been shot completely on one set?  And the idea 
behind the film is pretty ingenious.  The script itself stinks.  The 
characters are wholly unbelievable and the words that come out of their 
mouths are amateurish.  To add to insult, the actors themselves are not up 
to par either.  Maurice Dean Wint is terrible on screen, absolutely 
terrible.  Wint plays a cop who takes lead of the group.  Nicky Guadagni is 
just as bad as a "bleeding heart" liberal doctor.  The others are OK, the 
best being David Hewlett as Worth, the man with a secret, but even these 
actors have nothing good to work with.
The director Vincenzo Natali has a great eye for detail, he is quite 
creative, and his visual style is wonderful.  He sure can make the film 
look good, what he can't do is wrangle good performances.  And his 
creativity goes a bit overboard with some of the booby traps that are 
downright sadistic.  Some made me cringe hard.  Natali does a decent job of 
shooting the film and knows how to build tension within scenes.  Once he 
learns how to coerce good performances from his actors I think he'll be a 
decent director.
Should you rent Cube?  Only if there's nothing else to rent.  The movie is 
OK, but I really don't think it is worth watching if there is something 
else that you can spend 90 minutes with.  Sure, the film is beautiful and 
innovative, but this all doesn't mean anything if there are no real 
characters to bring you into the film.

Review for Stepmom (1998)
Stepmom is a movie that takes all of our emotion-strings and yanks on them
for two hours. It makes us laugh, cry, sympathize, and dislike. And it's
because of this that the movie fails.
Isabel (Julia Roberts) is a big-time fashion photographer. She's engaged
and living with an older divorced man, Luke (Ed Harris). Isabel gets to
take care of Luke's kids from time to time, much to the dismay of Luke's
ex-wife, Jackie (Susan Sarandon).
After Isabel temporarily loses Luke's younger son at the park the fighting
between Isabel and Jackie escalate. Both of them have their reasons for not
liking the other. Jackie finds Isabel irresponsible, self-centered, an
unworthy stepmom for her kids, and is afraid of Isabel stealing her
children. Isabel dislikes the kids, loves Luke, and thinks that Jackie is
overbearing and a control freak. It is this strife between the two women
that carries the film. A small subplot about Isabel, Jackie, and the young
daughter Anna (Jena Malone) also exists.
Chris Columbus directs Stepmom well, though his pacing is a bit off. The
film runs long at a few minutes over two hours. Columbus is able to pull
every emotion out of the bag. The film drips of melodrama. Columbus is
known more for his lighter work: Home Alone, Home Alone 2, and Mrs.
Doubtfire. Stepmom is the opposite of those - this is a drama - and
Columbus does well.
What kills the film is the script. The script is filled with cliches and
bad lines. The writer, Gigi Levangi, wrote some pretty melodramatic lines
for this film, take for instance what Isabel tells Anna to say to the boy
that just turned her down.
The only thing that shines from Stepmom are the performances by the three
leads. Harris, Sarandon, and Roberts all give good performances, but not
good enough to save this film from disaster. Skip Stepmom on the big screen
and catch it on video.
[Rated PG-13.  Running Time: 123 Minutes]

Review for Game, The (1997)
How do you get someone interested in something? Better yet, how do you get
someone interested in a story? Even more specific, how do you get someone
interested in watching your film? Is it the plot? Is it the characters? Is
it the camera work? Is it the actors?
To spark the curiosity in the audience, to get them interested in the film,
the writers and director David Finch start the audience with one question
then compound that question with even more questions until the audience is
completely drawn in. The Game works well doing this.
Michael Douglas is Nicolas Van Orton, a rich cutthroat San Francisco
businessman. He drives a nice car, lives in a big mansion, and owns his own
business. His life is not full of surprises, rather it is organized and he
likes it that way. The movie starts on his 48th birthday. His long lost,
rebel-of-the-family, brother Conrad (Sean Penn) calls Nicolas. They have
lunch and Conrad gives Nicolas a strange gift. It is an invitation from the
Consumer Recreation Services group that invites Nicolas to participate in a
game.
The game as Conrad explains is a "life changing experience." Unknowingly,
Nicolas finds time one day and signs up for the game. A day later he gets a
call from CRS telling him that he is not qualified for The Game. But, that
is just the start for Nicolas. From there on The Game begins.
The Game is at face value is a movie about an egotistical man that is
reduced to nothing and learning humility. But, is it really that?
Everything seems to be spiraling down for Nicolas, and we follow this in a
roller coaster thrill ride type movie. Everyone has turn against him, and
like him, we as the audience are wondering which person is part of The Game
and which is not.
David Fincher, whose last two outings were Aliens 3 and SE7EN, shows us
that he is more than capable of handling directing and the camera. If
you've seen either Aliens 3 or SE7EN you know that Fincher makes films that
deal with the shadow as much as it deals with the lights. And with The Game
he doesn't change that style. His lighting and his attention to detail
create some very interesting camera work and scenes. The Game is as much a
piece of art as it is a thrilling film. The film just looks gorgeous.
Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as Nicolas Van Orton. He nails Nicolas'
emotions right on the dot. I can't see any other actor for this part.
The year seems to be the year of actors redeeming themselves after a
release of a mediocre film. Sean Penn makes a come back with The Game from
his mediocre outing in She's So Lovely. Though he does not has a lot of
screen time, he takes every minute that he gets and chews scenery. Penn is
awesome in The Game.
An unexpected joy of the film is Deborah Unger. She does really well in the
film. Watch for her as Christine.
Worth mentioning is Howard Shore's haunting score to the film. Shore also
worked with Fincher on his last film SE7EN. The score for The Game is
perfectly done for the film. 
Fincher again does a great job of shooting the film. His use of different
camera angles and lighting creates tension while keeping the dark mood. He
definitely has an eye for detail and this is seen in every shot of the
film. There doesn't seem to be a shot in the film that does not show
something important or is wasted on scenery. Fincher uses flashbacks to
describe Nicolas' past, fortunately, he does it with restraint and does
overuse the flashbacks. With Aliens 3 and SE7EN, Fincher shows us that he
is a very talented director, with The Game he shows us that he hasn't lost
his touch.
The Game is not without its plot holes, but, like a well put together
thriller, these do not hurt the film while it is running. Though after the
film the plot holes do show up when you think about what just happened.
The Game is a taunt thriller that entertains all the way up to the end. The
Game keeps the audience guessing through the film, thus keeping the movie
flowing. The beautiful camera work and light of The Game has to been seen.
The Game is definitely a Don't Miss Film. Catch this one in the theatres.

Review for Daylight (1996)
Well, I know that Stallone is 50 years old now, but in Daylight he doesn't 
look it!  Daylight is a great disaster movie.  If you've seen Cliffhanger, 
you'll know Stallone's character already.  A guy with a bad past, but is in 
the right place at the wrong time.  A tunnel connecting New York and New 
Jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck 
carrying *very* flammable toxic waste.  A dozen or so people survive the 
collapses and the incinerating fireball (and what a fire ball it was!)  
Stallone, a former Emergency Medical Service man, is chauffeuring a rich 
couple around, when they reach the outside of the tunnel, before the 
explosion.  Then, 30 minutes into the movie, BOOM!
>From here on, the plot takes a back seat, and we are treated to some of the 
best camera work and action staged.  Most all the action is plausible and will 
hold you at the edge of your seat.  There are a few melodramatic parts here, 
but, they tend to work out well.  There is no general antagonist in this film, 
but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that.
Daylight is a great film, I saw a non-matinee showing of it, and I thought it 
was worth every penny.  The characterizations are mostly flat, one dimesional, 
but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters.   
Rob Cohen (Dragonheart) does a great job with this film.

Review for Yatgo ho yan (1997)
When watching Jackie Chan's previous films I have always said to myself,
"Boy, Jackie would have a big hit if he were to do a film with no plot or
story but action from start to finish.  Why insert these mindless plots?"
Mr. Nice Guy is just the film I was hoping for, but it is also just the
film I was not hoping for.
Plot?  What plot?  In Mr. Nice Guy, Jackie Chan plays a TV celebrity chef,
Jackie.  A news reporter accidentally leaves Jackie with a videotape that
two opposing mob groups want.  The mob groups try to get the tape back from
Jackie.  Enough plot, let's get to the action.
Mr. Nice Guy is filled with action scenes, but most of them don't work for
one reason.  I love Jackie Chan films because of the stark honesty of the
action sequences: no overuse of slow-mo or quick cutting to cover up
stunts.  Unfortunately, in Mr. Nice Guy there is a heavy dose of both and
not only does it take away from the honesty (and thrill) of the stunts, it
gets downright annoying at times.  The slow-mo is used in all the wrong
occasions-do we really need a slow-mo Jackie running down a street yelling
"Miki"?  Do we need the quick cuts and unintelligible shaky-camera
technique during the action sequences?  No.  It's been shown in previous
Jackie Chan films that we don't need these fancy camera tricks-all we need
is Jackie.
Mr. Nice Guy is a less than average Jackie Chan film.  There is less plot
than his previous films and contrary to what I thought, this is actually
detrimental to the film.  Now, I think that Jackie Chan films should have a
little more plot than did Mr. Nice Guy-I also think that there should be a
90 minute film of just the outtake of previous Chan films.  For Mr. Nice
Guy, the end outtakes are the best thing in the film.  As much as I love
very amiable Jackie Chan and his films, I'd have to say, skip Mr. Nice Guy.
 Jackie has done better than this.

Title
Review for I Know What You Did Last Summer (1997)
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUSMMER (1997)
First it was the return of the disaster movies and now it's the return of
the slasher movies. I Know What You Did Last Summer (from here on known as
Last Summer) is the second slasher movie from writer Kevin Williamson. His
last was the wildly popular and entertaining Scream. What classifies a
movie as a slasher movie? 1) The killer has to wear some sort of a mask --
this time around the killer is dressed as The Gorton's Fisherman. 2) The
ditsy female leads who have ample cleavage. And 3) The cast of
one-dimensional characters that serve as slasher fodder. I'm happy to say
that Last Summer dutifully fulfills all the requirements as a slasher movie.
During their last summer together, two teen couples go to the beach and
have a party. One of them gets raging drunk. His friends, being the good
friends that they are, don't let him drive. But, while driving back a
series of events happen that causes the driver to hit a man on some pretty
curvy roads. In a panic the teens dump the dead guy into the sea and swear
to each other that they won't tell anyone what they did.
A year after the accident the teens are torn apart avoiding each other like
the plague. But, the terror starts with a small note to one of the teens,
Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt of the TV show "Party of Five"). After
receiving the note the town is terrorized by the Gorton's Fisherman who
kills with a mighty right hook. The killer, whose identity is unknown, also
summons the three other teens --Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar of the TV show
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer", Barry (Ryan Phillippe), and Ray (Freddie Prinze
Jr.).
It's sad to say that Last Summer is not as enjoyable as Scream. It does not
even come close to being as scary as Scream. The problem that I see with
Last Summer is that it IS the movie that the characters in Scream poked fun
at. In Last Summer the characters do all the wrong things, which were all
readily pointed out by the characters in Scream. Keep in mind that
Williamson wrote both films. At least in Scream the characters knew that
they were in a slasher movie and the script took courage in poking fun at
its own genre. Not so with Last Summer, Last Summer takes itself seriously
and that is just no fun.
None of the performances were great, but what do you expect from a slasher
movie? The two male leads were obviously picked because the look good. And
the two female leads were picked, again, obviously because of their
cleavage, which is used often during the film. Director Jim Gillespie is no
Wes Craven (who directed Scream) and it shows. The scares in Last Summer
are mostly the shock type; bursts of loud sounds and
turn-around-to-see-the-killer type shocks. Nothing really frightening.
The ending of the film, though predictable, was very cool. I wanted to like
I Know What You Did Last Summer, but there isn't much to like in this film.
It's just not as fun as Scream was and at points it's just not fun at all.
I know that I Know What You Did Last Summer will inevitably have a big draw
because of the heavy promotion of it being from the writer of Scream, but
if you want to see this film, I would suggest that you do it during a
matinee showing or on video. I did learn something from this movie though,
if you happen to kill someone while driving don't dump them out to sea. But
if you do decide to dump them out to sea, do check that they are dead
before dumping them out to sea. You could avoid the ghastly death by fishhook.

Title
Review for Edtv (1999)
There is only one good reason to see EDtv. Matthew McConaughey? No. The
crowd-pleasing-take-no-risks direction by Ron Howard? No. The funny, yet
unoriginal, script by Michel Poulette and Lowell Ganz? No. I'll tell you the
only reason to see EDtv later on in the review.
TrueTV is a cable broadcast company that is struggling to get better ratings
(it is doing worse than the gardening channel). The woman put in charge of
rescuing the cable channel is Cynthia (Ellen DeGeneres) Toppings. Cynthia comes
up with the idea of putting a camera on a man 24 hours a day and broadcasting
that. A great idea especially if you look at how engrossed people are when
spying or peeping into other people's lives. Look at the many webcams available
on the Internet (including the infamous Steve-Cam that, at times, points at
me). People are just intrigued by the idea of watching someone else's life.
The man that Cynthia picks as the star of this 24-hour TV-cast is Ed (Matthew
McConaughey) Pekurny. Ed is a 31-year old video store clerk that, when at a
bar, wears his beer around his neck. His family is disfunctional: his father
left him at an early age, his brother Ray (Woody Harrelson) is a "blossoming"
entrepreneur, and his sister's a drunk dating a cocktail lounge piano player.
And this is also the perfect person for Cynthia's project  Ed is charming and
good looking with enough family problems for some potential onscreen drama.
The first few days Ed's life are pretty uneventful. The show seems like it's
about to sink, the network executives are calling for the show to be cancelled.
That is until Ed falls for his brother's girlfriend, Shari (Jenna Elfman). And
this is where the drama in Ed's life kicks into high gear.
As EDtv becomes increasingly more popular, Ed finds out that being famous is
not all that it's cut out to be. The price of celebrity is the loss of privacy.
Ed finds this out rather quickly as his show's ratings skyrockets.
The idea behind EDtv is not original, everyone's already heard of The Truman
Show starring Jim Carrey in which a man is on TV 24-hours a day also. So, is
EDtv different from The Truman Show? Definitely, whereas The Truman Show was
about a man unknowingly stuck in a TV world, Ed chooses to be on TV all day.
Then there is the issue of believability and real-world-ness. EDtv feels real
and has that sense of "it could really happen." The Truman Show doesn't.
Ron Howard is a director who takes no risks when doing a film, which is fine,
he puts out crowd-pleasers. Films that everyone likes but are not exactly
innovative. EDtv is another one of those films. Howard is given a great idea to
work with, but doesn't take it to its full potential. Instead he keeps the film
light-hearted. There could have been so many other things that Howard and the
two scripters could have looked at, but didn't  which is somewhat of a
disappointment. Howard does a good job with EDtv, but it could have been
better.
Scripters Michel Poulette and Lowell Ganz start off EDtv well enough and for
about half of the film they keep it moving at a good pace, but the script
starts to lose steam as we roll into the second hour. They throw twists into
Ed's life to try to spice it up, but I did end up looking at my watch a few
times wondering when the film was going to tie things up and finish.
Matthew McConaughey does well as Ed. Other performers also fair well. These
other performers include Ron Howard's brother Clint as an EDtv director with a
hair-plug problem, Martin Landau as Ed's stepfather ("I gotta pee...wish me
luck."), and Ellen DeGeneres. But the performer to look for, and the reason to
see the film, is Jenna Elfman. Elfman is best known as Dharma from ABCs sitcom
Dharma and Greg. Elfman lights up the screen every time, she is one of those
performers whom you just like from the very start. Kudos to Elfman for a
wonderful performance that rescues EDtv.
There are two things that feel out of place in EDtv. The first is Rob Reiner
who is the head of TrueTV. He plays a mean-spirited executive that only cares
about the bottom line that we're all supposed to hate. But, it's Rob Reiner!
It's pretty hard to hate Rob Reiner and in EDtv I couldn't really get myself to
hate his character. The second is Elizabeth Hurley's character, whom really
didn't help to do anything. The subplot with her as a model vying for Ed's
attention so that she can get TV exposure is a waste of time.
Catch EDtv during a matinee showing to see Jenna Elfman who is the highlight of
the film. EDtv is a film that has great potential behind it, but no one in the
director and screenwriter's chairs to actually make it more than just a
crowd-pleaser. This could have been one creative and genuinely intriguing film.

Title
Review for Pushing Tin (1999)
Pushing Tin is one of those movies that have at its core a subject that is
quite exciting, but fails to realize it to its full potential.  With
Pushing Tin, the core subject is the lives of air traffic controllers.  The
movie starts out well, but then it crashes and burns as if there were no
air traffic controller guiding this film along.
There are in essence two parts to Pushing Tin.  Both parts center on the
life of Nick (John Cusack) Falzone.  The first part of the film shows
Falzone at work as a air traffic controller at one of the most busy air
spaces in the world, which is located in New York.  Falzone is the best of
the best when it comes to air traffic controllers, able to mentally
reconstruct the two-dimensional radar display into a three-dimensional
image.  He can talk faster than the fastest person in the profession and
can line up those planes faster than anyone in the office.  This first part
is fast paced, exciting, and quite watchable.  The second part of the film
deals with Falzone's life outside of the air traffic control room.  This
includes Nick's wife who is played by the unrecognizable Cate Blanchet.
Everything changes for Nick one day as another air traffic controller,
Russell (Billy Bob Thornton) Bell, enters the picture.  Bell seems to be
the better controller than Nick is, and being the competitive sorts that
the both of them are, they are at each other's throats for the rest of the
film.  This concocted tension between the two is ludicrous.  The tension
built like this could have been for any profession, why did writers Glen
and Les Charles (who created "Cheers") have to saddle it with air traffic
controllers is beyond me.  I mean it could have well been two guys who are
laying phone cable and still have been the same movie.  The movie's plot
boils down to the common male conflict, "mine is bigger than yours."
As the movie moves along Nick's life falls apart and near the end of the
movie we're wondering how things are going to resolve themselves.  And
things resolve themselves in a typical sitcom kind of way - except that in
Cheers the problems are all made and solved in 30 minutes, in Pushing Tin
it's a painful 110 minutes.  Let's just say that Nick's problems are solved
with cold water and jet wash.  The ending is just plain silly.
Director Mike Newell who has directed strong films such as Four Weddings
and a Funeral does what he can with the awful script.  The script is
occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but those moments are far and in
between.  There was one sequence that I did enjoy and that was the sequence
in which Falzone shows off his driving skills to Bell.
The primary actors in the film all do well with the material.  Cusack does
exceptionally well with his material, giving how thin his part really is.
Cusack is able to pump more life into his part just by being onscreen.
Thornton is always a reliable actor and he doesn't fail in Pushing Tin
either.  His performance is wonderful as the exceedingly quite Bell.
Blanchet (Elizabeth) is hilarious in her role.
It's too bad that Pushing Tin is pushing a bad script.  This movie could
have been much more.  There are great performances in the film and a
director that knows what he's doing.  It's just the script that fails in
all ways.  The script wanders like a plane in the sky without destination.
Skip Pushing Tin in the theatres and save your money for something else.
This might be a decent catch on video if you want to see Cusack, Thornton,
and Blanchet's performances, but next to that, it's a skip on video also.

Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones both carry some star power. Connery
is the epitome of James Bond. And even now he is still doing the part of
Bond  take a look at his character Mason in The Rock. Zeta-Jones coming
off her hot debut in The Mask of Zorro is a hot commodity these days. With
this much star power this movie can't lose -- or can it?
Mac (Sean Connery) is a professional thief who is rich enough that he
doesn't have to steal for the money  he steals for the enjoyment and the
thrill. Gin (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is an insurance agent for a large
insurance company. She is going undercover and working hand in hand with
Mac in order to catch him in the act of stealing. She's the bait for the
entrapment of Mac during the next robbery, a theft of a beautiful Chinese
mask. But, is Gin all that she says she is?
We have two other minor characters who are in the shadows most of the time,
but we get the sneaking suspicion that they have a hand in all that is
happening. These two are Gin's boss Hector (Will Patton) Cruz and Mac's
former partner Thibadeaux (Ving Rhames). Patton, who I loved in Armageddon,
plays Cruz without much flair and the accent that he adopts feels
counterfeit. Rhames doesn't get enough screen time to do anything
substantial, his talents are completely wasted in Entrapment.
The script by Ron Bass (My Best Friend's Wedding) and William Broyles Jr.
takes us on a whirlwind tour of the world, stopping at many photogenic
locations. But, all of this eye candy and beautiful cinematography doesn't
matter since the script is weak. The lack of thrills is the downfall of
this film. The script isn't the only thing that is flat in this film though.
Sean Connery gives a wooden performance as Mac. His performance is lacking
that onscreen charisma that we've come to love from him. Because of his
mediocre performance there is no real tension between him and Zeta-Jones
and the sexual tension between the two fizzles. At times the relationship
between Mac and Gin felt more father-daughter like than romantic.
The direction from Jon Amiel is surprisingly tame. Amiel who directed one
of the best thrillers I've seen, CopyCat, is bland in this film. The
tension-filled scenes are lax, with the focus more on Zeta-Jones's curves
than on the action. Amiel was not the first director hired for this film
though. Amiel took over the helm from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua was the director
who pumped life into the lifeless film The Replacement Killers. Fuqua's
direction in Entrapment would have raised it out of mediocrity  Fuqua has
a keen eye for style that, when applied correctly, would have made us
forget about the horribly thin script.
Had it not been for the multiple, seemingly contrived, twists at the end of
the film, I would have walked out of the theatre fuming. But, the twists
were pretty fun to watch unfold and I walked out of the theatre with a
slight smile on my face. I don't recommend seeing Entrapment in the
theatres, matinee or otherwise. Though, this would be a good pick for a
weekend video rental.

Review for Hak hap (1996)
Black Mask can be described with one word: Gratuitous.  The Black Mask is
gratuitous in its use of blood, gratuitous its use of violence, and
gratuitous in its use of the camera.  What isn't gratuitous in the film is
its level of adrenaline.
After a good US introduction with Lethal Weapon 4, it was only a matter of
time before the studio heads in Hollywood started to try to cash in on Jet
Li's previous films.  Jet Li is fast, really fast.  Watching his martial
arts onscreen is a joy because it's not just a matter of enjoying it, but
of trying to keep up with his hands and feet.  Pair Li up with one of the
best martial arts choreographers around, Woo-Ping Yuen (who did the
choreographing for The Matrix), and you should have a hell of a film, right?
Wrong, nothing can save this film from the horrible editing and directing.
And although not many Hong Kong films have a good story, most of them at
least have good characters  not Black Mask.  Put together the bad editing,
directing, and the lack of a good character and the whole movie is nothing
more than repetitive scenes of people beating each other to a bloody pulp.
After the first few action scenes of this it just got boring.  The
repetitiveness of the action was a real downer.  By the end of the film
during the final show down, when the hero goes up against the evil boss, I
was left to look at my watch and wonder when the hero was finally going to
beat the living daylights out of the evil boss and get the movie over with.
Obviously, there was a lot of money put into this film when it was made in
1996.  The production design is tremendously polished, the sets are well
done, the costumes are generally well done, and the level of explosions is
high.  None of this saves the film either.  Maybe there was a lot that was
lost during the transition from being a Hong Kong film to being an English
film -- sometimes horrible cuts are made to films when they make this
transition -- but, I'm not sure if this is true with Black Mask or not.
The one thing that I liked about the film was the creative casting of the
voice talent.  Yes, the lines and the voice acting quality of the dubbing
were terrible, but the actors that the casting director selected were
hilarious.  I'm not sure if it was intentional or not, but the choices were
great.
One has to be a huge Jet Li fan to actually pay to see this film.  I'm
still annoyed that I paid, even at matinee, to see this piece of bad
filmmaking.  A flat, monotonous, and uninteresting film that is all looks
but lacks punch, Black Mask earns the dubious award of being a Skip, Skip,
Skip film.  Skip this film at matinee, Skip this film on video, and
definitely Skip this film if it's being shown at full price.

Title
Review for Mummy, The (1999)
The Mummy is a seriously flawed film that is saved by only two things: Its
tongue-in-cheek attitude and the over-the-top action.  Sure, there were
some spectacular special effects, but they hurt the film more than they
helped.  I'll get to that later.
As the film opens we are transported back three thousand years where we
meet Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) a high priest that is cursed and buried alive
the burial/mummification is quite a nasty process.  Flash forward to 1923
where we meet adventurer Rick (Brenden Fraser) O'Connell who is hired to
lead a librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) Carnarvon and her brother Jonathon
(John Hannah) to find the lost city of Hamunaptra in Egypt.  At Hamunaptra,
Jonathon expects to find a buried treasure.  Evelyn is going for the
challenge; Hamunaptra has never been found nor explored.  Along the way we
also meet a mysterious group of men who seem to have some vested interest
in Hamunaptra and give the adventurers a warning, `Leave or die.'  There is
also the sub-plot about another group of adventurers led by a backstabbing
former friend of O'Connell, Beni (Kevin J. O'Conner).
When the groups get to Hamunaptra both go in different directions with
their explorations.  But, together they find something completely evil:
Imhotep.  After mistakenly reading out of the wrong book, Imhotep is
revived from the dead and is now out to unleash the ten plagues onto Egypt
not a pretty sight given that it includes locusts, flesh-eating scarabs,
and other things that would make your skin crawl.  As you might have
guessed it, it's up to O'Connell, Evelyn, and Jonathon to save the world.
The Mummy is not a serious film by any means.  The previews do it injustice
by portraying it as some serious take on Indiana Jones  it's not.  The
Mummy is a comedy action-adventure film that does everything with its
tongue planted firmly in cheek.  There are numerous scenes where I burst
out laughing from either the sight jokes or from one-liners.  There are
quite a few tense, thrilling, and frightening moments in the film, but for
the most part to enjoy this film you need to walk into the theatre knowing
and expecting that it is a comedy action-adventure film that has a large
dose of special effects.
Fraser is brilliantly cast as O'Connell who is a tough guy with a sly
mouth.  Fraser has that rugged look, but also has the comic timing that is
needed to pull off the part of O'Connell.  In the action scenes Fraser is
fun to watch as he pretends he's in a John Woo film  double fisted pistols
and all.  Weisz, whom I last saw in the horrible Chain Reaction, does well
with her part also.  She does very well with the material she is given.
And John Hannah, who I enjoyed immensely in Sliding Doors, also does well
in The Mummy.  The person with the least spoken lines is Arnold Vosloo, but
he does very well as the creepy Imhotep.  Vosloo is absolutely horrifying
as Imhotep and during the scenes where he is in the stages between the
living and dead, he is terrifying.
The director, Stephen Sommers (Deep Rising) writes the script.  Sommers
needs to be paired up with another writer because his characterizations are
absolutely non-existence.  The script moves like a hyperactive child from
one toy to the next.  This script never stops to take a breath, sometimes
leaving the audience behind in its rampage to get to the next action scene.
 This film runs over two hours long and could have easily been cut to a
much better length at 90-minutes.  As a director Sommers shows that he
knows how to do action.  The action sequences in The Mummy are stand out
and are mixed with a sly sense of humor.  I enjoyed the action in The Mummy.
As for the special effects, they were laid on a bit too thickly.  Even as
the film opens there is a heavy dose of special effects that instantly took
my attention away from the story that's being told.  The special effects in
some places are used wisely, but more often then not the special effects
are used to wow the audience  some of which works, like the sand storm, but
most of it just does nothing but make the audience wonder how it was done.
I liked the special effects in the film, but wished that Sommers could have
shown some restraint in its usage.  The effect that I liked most was that
of the mummies.  They had this quality of being up-to-date yet old and
nostalgic.  You'll have to see the film to know what I mean by that.  The
mummies just look cool but move with that Jason and the Argonauts type
movement.
Overall, I enjoyed The Mummy, it doesn't quite make it up to the point of
being a Don't Miss film, but I do highly recommend it.  This is a great
popcorn fluff film that will scare you, make you laugh, and move you to the
edge of your seat.  The Mummy is one of those films that I like to stick in
the category of Stupid-But-Fun.  Catch The Mummy during a matinee showing
for its inventive action, special effects, and the comedy of Brenden Fraser.
 a guy with a helluva attitude who loves the cinema.

Review for Jing cha gu shi IV: Jian dan ren wu (1996)
It's hard to review a Jackie Chan movie, for the sheer reason that if
you've written one, you've written one for all of his films.  First Strike
is no different.  Jackie Chan movies are not to be seen for an intricate
story or immense character development.  Rather they are seen for the
incredible action and the death-defying stunt work.
The story in First Strike that is use to string along the action scenes
goes like this:  A double agent has stolen a nuclear warhead in which he is
to delivery to some Russian Mafia guys in Australia.  The action takes
place in the Ukraine (Canada substituting) and Australia.
The stunts in First Strike are most impressive.  They include Jackie
fighting with all sorts of different objects (ladders, tables, toxic fish).
 They also include Jackie fighting in all different locations, snowfields,
underwater with large sharks, and hanging onto the edge of a building.  And
the most impressive of them all is the one in which Jackie flies off a
cliff and grabs onto a flying helicopter.  My most favorite scene is the
one where Jackie takes on a half of a dozen men with sticks.  He does this
with the creative use of tables, chairs, brooms, and a ladder!
The humor is laid on thick in First Strike, and many times I found myself
laughing out loud at the silliness on screen.
First Strike seems to be the most American of all the Jackie films
re-released in the US so far.  The dubbing is pretty good and the new music
sounds suspiciously like the music from Rumble in the Bronx (both scores
are done by J. Peter Robinson).
When you see First Strike don't expect anything but pure action and humor.
And if you can do this, you'll enjoy First Strike.  But, expectations or
not, First Strike is yet another Jackie Chan movie that you should see.

Review for Star Trek: First Contact (1996)
[Note that followups are directed to rec.arts.movies.current-films and
rec.arts.movies.startrek.current only, not to rec.arts.sf.movies.  -Moderator]
Director:  Jonathan Frakes
Screenwriters: Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga
Starring:  Patrick Steward, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton,       
Prepared to be assimilated?  Yes!  Knowing the old saying that all even 
numbered Star Trek movies are good, and all odd numbered movies are either 
mediocre or bad, I came into First Contact ready to see a good movie.  Did I 
come out with a feeling that I saw a good movie?  Yes.
For Star Trek movies there is one problem that follows them.  You have to 
cater to two distinctly different audiences in order to make a large profit.  
The first audience is the die-hard Star Trek fans.  The second is the more 
general audience, who either knows little or nothing about Star Trek.  First 
Contact swings a lot towards the first audience.  It is built around Captain 
Picards original encounter with the Borg.
The encounter gets a small flashback in the beginning of the film, and that is 
all that is really said about the encounter to help the general audience 
along.  For those of us who are well versed in what happened between Picard 
and the Borg, we are drawn into the story and understand what is driving 
Picard to do what he is doing.  For the rest of the general audience, they are 
left to catch up.  And the director, Jonathan Frakes (also playing Riker), 
gives little time to catch up.  From the explosive starship battle with the 
Borg cube beginning to the explosive ending, Frakes keeps the pace of the 
movie quick.
The story is about the Borg heading for Earth, readying to assimilate the 
human race.  The new Enterprise E, with Picard at the helm is sent elsewhere 
by the Admiral.  The Admiral believes that Picard is too emotionally involved 
with the Borg to be in this battle.  Picard, obviously disregards the orders 
and goes into battle.  The Borg in a last ditch effort goes back in time to 
try to assimilate the human race back then.  And that is where the real meat 
of the story goes.
If you are a Trekker or are familiar with the Next Generation crew, you will 
love this film.  If you are new to the Star Trek franchise, you might want to 
just review what happened between Picard and the Borg before going off to see 
this film. There is a great mix of humor and action in this film.  And the 
pacing of the film will keep you at the edge of your seats in many tense 
situations.
But, in any case, resistance is futile.  So go see this film!


Title
Review for Men in Black (1997)
In a recent interview when asked what he did in Men in Black, Tommy Lee
Jones gave a simple answer, "You can't be too cool in this movie." Isn't
that the truth Mr. Jones. And cool he is along with Mr. Smith.
I don't remember laughing so hard and much during any recent movie that
I've seen. Men In Black is an all out sci-fi comedy from Barry Sonnenfeld
(Get Shorty, The Addams Family). There is a story that carries on in Men In
Black, but it's pretty thin. And that's a good thing. For a movie like MIB
there's nothing more annoying than a heavy plot to weight down the movie.
MIB takes from comic roots, and the story seems to be on that line too,
simple and to the point, nothing that gets in the way of the comedy and
special effects. 
Tommy Lee Jones plays Agent K, who works for the super secret MIB group.
They answer to no one, because government asks too many questions.
Patenting alien technology and selling it here on Earth creates the funds
needed to run the MIB group. The MIB serves as the INS (Immigration and
Naturalization Service) of the universe. They get aliens on Earth, and keep
track of them. Will Smith plays a NYPD cop who is recruited by Agent K to
work for the MIB and he soon becomes Agent J. Smith, who did some alien
hunting in Independence Day, gets more to do in this film. And it is a
well-deserved part for Smith. Together K and J must find a "bug" who has
crash landed here on Earth and is trying to steal a universe in Orion's
Belt. Well, there's the story. Pretty simple, but enough to keep the
audience at bay for just under two hours.
The bug that has crash-landed here on Earth takes over the body of a
farmer, Edgar, played very well by Vincent D'Onofrio. The alien has a hard
time inhabitting Edgar's body, and this is one of the comedy bits that runs
through the movie. Seeing the alien walk around in Edgar's body,
uncomfortable and crowded. The comedy in the movie comes in all forms, some
from J encountering new aliens to aliens who take the bodies of bulldogs.
Tommy Lee Jones, who admits in interviews that he is not a comedic actor,
pulls a great performance out of the hat. His seriousness on the screen
equates to some of the funniest scenes. Will Smith who is a natural comic
does well (again) as an alien-hunter.
The overall production value is noticeable. The aliens are incredibly
detailed, I especially liked the Ambassador alien who lives in a man's
head. This alien is so life like in the movie that it was a
how-did-they-do-that moment. The break-room aliens were also hilarious.
But, these are just a few of the many aliens that inhabit the world of MIB.
And unlike some sci-fi movies where all the aliens are humanoid and speak
English, MIB is populated by aliens who are of all shapes and sizes and
speak their own native languages. The set designs, alien designs, and
costume designs are all well done. From the simple black suits that MIB
agents wear to aliens whose heads regenerate after being shot, the movie
just drips with big, well done production values.
In the worth mentioning section, I have to mention two things. First is the
film score by Danny Elfman. Yet another great movie score by Elfman
(Batman, Mission:Impossible, Nightmare Before Christmas). The music fits so
well with the film that it is hardly noticeable at times. The second thing
that is worth mentioning is the opening sequence that follows a mosquito in
flight for five minutes, during the credits, before an untimely death.
Men In Black is one of those heavily hyped films that doesn't disappoint.
It has a well-balanced blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and
eye-opening-special effects that will appeal to everyone. Go see Men In
Black, you won't be sorry.

Review for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001)
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001)
Reviewed by Steve Kong (Reviews@UltraMookie.com)
Copyright (c) 2001 Steve Kong
URL:  http://www.ultramookie.com/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=5
So, does Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within live up to its hype?  Yes and 
no.  What definitely lives up to the hype is the computer animation.  What 
doesn't live up to the hype is a totally engrossing story and good action.
Lets tackle the story first.  The story follows Dr. Aki Ross (Ming-Na Wen) 
who is a human infect with an alien "spirit".  She and a Dr. Sid (Donald 
Sutherland) are working on a way to save the Earth, which is being overrun 
by these spirits.  These spirits will take the life force of any life form 
that it touches, killing them instantly.  But, Dr. Sid was able to help Dr. 
Ross and kept her from dying from the infection.  Helping these two doctors 
is the Deep Eyes squadron.  Captain Grey (Alec Baldwin) leads the squadron; 
he also has a love interest for Dr. Ross.  The two doctors are trying to 
save the Earth in an environmentally safe way, a way that will not destroy 
the Gaia (the spirit of a world).  On the other hand there is General Hein 
(James Woods) who wants to fire a huge orbiting cannon at the crater where 
the alien meteor is.  He thinks this will kill off the spirits and free the 
Earth.  The doctors think different, they think that this will kill the 
Gaia of the Earth also and if the Gaia of the Earth dies, then all the 
spirits on the world will die.
The story is overly complicated, especially since director/writer Hironobu 
Sakaguchi decided to throw in all kinds of meta-physical, existential, and 
religious non-sense into what could have been a pretty straightforward and 
fun story.  The underlying story is pretty simple and I would have loved to 
see it told without all this philosophical crap.  The complication bogs the 
movie down and sometimes makes it feel like it is preaching about saving 
the Earth to an audience who is just there to see a cool movie.  Does this 
hurt the film though?  Nope.
What saves the film is the out-of-this-world eye-opening computer generated 
animation.  This stuff truly lives up to its hype.  The movie opens with a 
very long close-up of Aki's eye and is incredible!  It's almost as if the 
filmmakers are inviting you to try to find something wrong  yet we are 
stunned at what is onscreen.  Yes, there are times when the characters move 
woodenly, but most of the time the movie gives a true sense of 
reality.  The characters all look convincing and their movements are 
realistic.  But, because it is animation, the filmmakers are able to do so 
much more with the characters and with the environment.  In the opening 
sequence we see Aki through the ground (from bottom up) and it is just a 
stunning visual.  These stunning mind-bending visuals are used all through 
the film.  The landscapes that are created in the film are especially 
stunning.  There was one thing that felt "off" about the characters 
though.  The speech and the mouth movements just felt a little off.  Kind 
of like watching a movie with its soundtrack just a little be off.  But, 
that's no biggie.
The voice acting is great!  Ming-Na does a good job with her role, as does 
Alec Baldwin.  But the real winners here are Donald Sutherland, Peri Gilpin 
as one of the DeepEyes, Ving Rhames as another Deep Eye, and Steve Buscemi 
as a pilot for the Deep Eyes.  Buscemi was especially good and was 
incredibly funny (like always).  The only voice that felt out of place, and 
this was because of the incredibly lame lines he got and the dumb things 
his character had to do, was James Woods.  Usually, I like Woods a lot as 
an actor, but he just wasn't doing well in Final Fantasy.  His General Hein 
was a bit too badly written.
The score from Elliot Goldenthal is one to listen for.  It is well done.
Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is truly a revolutionary step forward for 
computer-generated movies.  Will CG actors be replacing real human actors 
anytime soon?  Nah, there's still a ways to go, but Final Fantasy shows 
just how far things have come.  Should you see Final Fantasy?  Without a 
question, Yes!  This is a Don't Miss movie.  See it for the incredible 
visuals that will leave you breathless.  After a while I stopped trying to 
keep track of all that was happening in the story because it was so very 
complicated.  And at times seeing how the consistency of the story itself 
wavered, it seems that the moviemakers also started to forget about the 
stories and concentrated on the visuals  which is a damn good thing because 
this film is all eye-candy and it is something worth seeing twice.

Title
Review for Bulworth (1998)
Bulworth is a movie with a political message, and Warren Beatty -- who
stars, writes, directs and produces -- knows this. So, instead of dancing
around and prettying up the political message, Beatty smashes it over our
heads like a sledgehammer. The hit is not at all painful though; Beatty
approaches the political aspect of the film in a cynical and humorous way.
In March 1996, Senator Jay Billington Bulworth (Beatty) is in a fierce
battle to be reelected. It is a rainy night and Bulworth is sitting in his
office crying while watching his own campaign ads. He's not crying because
his ads touch his heart; he's crying because he's sick of all the lies he's
propagated and promises broken because he took money from lobbyists and big
companies. Bulworth is so depressed that he takes out a contract on his own
life and it is from here that the movie picks up a lot of power.
Knowing that he only has a few more days to live, Bulworth takes this as a
chance to speak what's truly on his mind. He attends a meeting at a church
in South Central L.A. where he bluntly tells the congregation that they
need to put down the malt liqueur, stop complaining, and start doing
something poor living conditions. He also tells them that it's obvious that
the political parties don't care about them because they don't donate
enough money. In a dinner with big movie producers, Bulworth tells them how
truly bad their work is.
Bulworth is ready to be hit until he meets Nina (Halle Berry) a woman
inspired by his speech at the church. And from her he is taken into the
ghettos of L.A. where he sees the injustices that go on there and learns a
little about rap. Bulworth starts to wrap his political messages in rap
lyrics and music. The lyrics to his rap "songs" are raw and angry but carry
a strong good message.
Beatty starts Bulworth off with a lot of energy but as the film progresses,
he loses some. The two speeches he makes, at the church and dinner, are the
two most memorable scenes. A hilarious image is that of Beatty dressed
gangster-style with knee length shorts, a large oversized sweatshirt, some
funky sunglasses, and a knit cap. The movie rests on Beatty's performance;
he takes his part and runs with it. Beatty's performance is brilliant.
Halle Berry does well as Nina but a better supporting role overshadows her
performance. This is Oliver Platt (Executive Decision, Dangerous Beauty) as
Bulworth's hyperactive drug-addicted campaign manager who has to find all
sorts of ways to stop Bulworth's "shoot from the hips" speeches.
One thing that didn't feel right about the film was the ending. The
"convert" plot line, about a dope dealer, feels all wrong and the ambiguous
ending is irksome.
The politics are clearly presented in Bulworth. Like them or not, you'll
love the film. It's entertaining enough on one level to keep you laughing
and attentive. On a deeper level, Bulworth shoves some rather frightening
political views down your throat. Beatty has written, directed, and acted a
brilliant film. If compared to the last two political films that I've seen,
Wag the Dog and Primary Colors, I would have to say this: Bulworth has the
cynicism of Wag the Dog bumped up a few notches and it is brave enough to
go where Primary Colors skirted away from. Don't Miss Bulworth.

Title
Review for Grosse Pointe Blank (1997)
I saw the trailers for Grosse Pointe Blank and wondered what this movie could 
possible be about. And I think most people felt the same. The trailer does the 
movie no good. Grosse Pointe Blank is a movie that cannot be easily 
categorized. There is no a single genre that can describe Grosse Pointe Blank.
Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) is a professional hitman. He is going through a 
life crisis. He is tired of his profession and is unsure of what he really is. 
By coincident, his next hit job is in his hometown and this tenth high school 
reunion also being held. Blank insists that he not go to the reunion. But with 
a little convincing from his office manager (Joan Cusack) and his fearful 
therapist (Alan Arkin), he agrees to do the hit job and to attend the reunion. 
Blank's hesitation to go to the reunion stems from what happened ten years ago 
during his senior prom. He left his girlfriend, Debi stranded, and unable to 
go go to the prom. Debi is played by the beautiful Minnie Driver. A funny 
subplot about a competing hitman trying to start a Union for hitmen unfolds 
during the movie.
The meat of Grosse Pointe Blank is a love story, and to a point, redemption 
story. Blank wants to get redemption from that one night when he stood Debi 
up. But she wants him to earn it. Along with this love story is a comedy that 
includes Dan Aykroyd as the opposing hitman trying to start the Hitmen's 
Union, two FBI guys, a therapist who feels threatened by Blank, and all of the 
people of Grosse Pointe. At one point Blank tells Debi's father that he is a 
professional hitman, the reply he gets is, "Good for you, growth industry." 
Then there is the action, and at times highly violent, portion of the film. I 
found this portion to be as well done as the previous two, but some may find 
this portion to be a turn off. With all of these different genres in the same 
film, the obvious question would be: Do the work together well? Yes, they work 
really well.
John Cusack, who is one of the four writers of this movie, gives a good 
performance of Martin Q Blank. Blank, who is the only sane character in this 
movie. Minnie Driver, although good in the movie, gives a flat dull 
performance as Debi.  I enjoyed the performances of Dan Aykroyd as the 
opposing hitman, and Alan Arkin as the threatened therapist.  Dan Aykroyd 
looks to be having the time of his life in this movie.  Arkin gives a 
wonderfully off-beat performance.
A special mention for Grosse Pointe Blank is it's soundtrack. The soundtrack 
is filled with 80's music and is a real joy. The soundtrack fits in well with 
the movie.
Grosse Pointe Blank is a quirky movie the defies categorization. It has a 
great mix of attitude and quirky dialog.  This makes for a fun movie that is 
enjoyable and well worth the money to see.

Review for Mulan (1998)
Disney makes good animated features, but once in a long while Disney will
create a great animated feature. Mulan fits into the latter category.
There's nothing to criticize Mulan about, so this Don't Miss film will get
a shorter review than most films. 
The animation for Mulan is stunning, to say the least. It's a mix of highly
detailed backgrounds, computer generated special effects, and
simplified-yet-detailed characters all blended to give a sense of grandeur.
The main characters are all well done.
Mulan is an ancient Chinese tale about a young woman who takes her father's
place in the Imperial army. Mulan's father is old, fragile, and has a bad
leg - he is also the only man in the Fa family. The Imperial army is in
need of more men to fight the incoming Huns; each family from each village,
by the order of the Emperor of China, will send one man to fight for the army.
Mulan's father had already fought in one war and Mulan sees no reason that
he should go fight again. So, late one night Mulan cuts her hair, steals
her father's armor, and goes off to join the army for the Fa family.
Protecting Mulan is Mushu, a small dragon who is trying to prove himself to
the spirits of the Fa family.
Ming-Na Wen (One Night Stand, The Joy Luck Club) is the voice talent for
the character Mulan. Wen does a wonderful job with Mulan. The voice I loved
the most was Eddie Murphy's Mushu the dragon, and he is hilarious. Murphy's
Mushu is to Mulan what Robin William's Genie was to Aladdin. 
With Disney animated features it's not just the animation that counts, it's
also the music. With the score done by Jerry Goldsmith and the lyrics by
Matthew Wilder, Mulan is one of the best sounding Disney features. I liked
Hercules, but Mulan beats Hercules by a long shot. 
One thing I'd like to mention. At first when I saw the previews for Mulan,
I thought that Disney had messed up and not studied up enough for the
costumes. I wondered, "Why are all the Chinese people dressed like that?
Why are they dressed in Japanese-like kimonos?" I found out later from my
mom that Disney had done their homework and the costumes were consistent
with the period.
Let's not forget why Disney's animated features are so popular; they are
written on two levels one for children and one for adults. For children,
Mulan is the perfect film. It's funny and it has cute characters (including
Mushu the dragon, a cool horse, a funny dog, and a cricket.) For the
adults, Mulan has a story rich enough with well-written characters and
action that will entertain you for its full running time.
Kudos to the handful of writers for putting together a wonderfully
entertaining film with enough laughs to keep us interested - but also well
developed and emotional characters to round out the film.
Don't Miss Mulan. This is the best Disney animated feature since The Lion
King. Mulan is not just for kids either, adults can go and enjoy a
well-written and funny movie.

Title
Review for Big Hit, The (1998)
Are you male, under 19, and have the attention span of an ant?  If you
answered "yes" to all of these questions read no further.  The Big Hit is a
movie for you: go see it now.  For the rest, please read on and see if
you'll enjoy this movie or not.
The Big Hit is the type of movie that requires you to step into the theatre
with the correct mindset: brain in the "off" position and ready for some
stupid fun.
Melvin Smiley (Mark Wahlberg) is a hit man with a heart of gold (wait, I
think I've heard this one before) who is a human ATM machine for two women:
his fiancee (Christina Applegate) and his mistress (Lela Rochon).  Melvin
wants to live a regular life while keeping up with his hit man job -- I've
heard this one before also in Grosse Pointe Blank.  Along with his two
women; he has a group of hit men that are reasonably loyal to him.
Among his "teammates" are Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips), Crunch (Bokeem
Woodbine), Gump (Robert Dunne), and Vinnie (Antonio Sabato Jr.).  After an
adrenaline-pumping opening reminiscent of a MTV video cut and slashed with
scenes of violence, we are pushed into the main "story" of The Big Hit.
Cisco has picked up a moonlighting assignment for the group.  He wants to
bring in Melvin, but Melvin doesn't want to moonlight knowing that their
boss Paris (Avery Brooks) would kill all of them if he found out.
After finding that his finances are not as healthy as he would like them to
be, Melvin hesitantly signs up with Cisco to go on the moonlighting gig.
The plan is to kidnap the daughter (China Chow) of a wealthy Japanese film
producer and get some ransom.  Sounds easy enough, but there are
complicating matters: the daughter is the goddaughter of Paris and Paris is
not happy about the kidnapping.  Cisco is able to double-cross Melvin and
is now out to kill Melvin to save his own butt.
There are two running gags in The Big Hit.  One involves Melvin, a nerdy
video store clerk, and an overdue copy of King Kong Lives.  The other
involves Crunch, self-love, and is too explicit to mention in a review.
Mark Wahlberg is basically reviving his Dirk Diggler role from Boogie
Nights in The Big Hit.  His Melvin is constantly apologizing.  It works for
the beginning of the film but wears short halfway through.  Lou Diamond
Phillips with a silver-capped front tooth is hilarious as Cisco.  China
Chow is a superb newcomer; I hope to see her in more films soon.  The scene
with her reading a ransom note will have you on the floor laughing.  The
other roles are so minor I don't need to mention them.
The saving grace for The Big Hit is the humor that is woven into the story.
 Director Che-Kirk Wong and writer Ben Ramsey know they don't have a
serious film in hand, so they ham it up.  And they do a good job at it.
This is an action film that knows that it's stupid and doesn't try at all
to redeem itself by trying to be serious.  Had a few other early 1998
action films taken the same route they would have been much better also
(two to mention would be the horrible Firestorm and the wet Hard Rain.)
Kudos to Wong and Ransey for keeping the cheeziness up while keeping the
action rolling.  Look for the scene with Wahlberg, a pair of garbage bags,
his fiancee, the in-laws, a hostage, and a rude dog.  This will have you
laughing out loud.
The action is what anchors The Big Hit, though, and the two main action
scenes are spaced somewhat far apart.  The opening action sequence is
marred by some MTV-style footage that serves only to disorientate the
audience.  The end action sequence is actually quite exciting.  I loved the
amazing car chase with Phillips and Wahlberg.
Worth mentioning is the production design by Taavo Soodor.  The
neighbourhood in which Melvin lives consists of houses that all look the
same and neighbours that synchronously mow their lawns.  Melvin's house is
bright and happy on the inside. His garage holds not only gardening tools
but an arsenal of weapons that could arm a small army.  The office of Paris
is artsy and beautiful.  The room that Chantel, Melvin's mistress, lives in
is satiny.  The production design is top notch.
The Big Hit should be renamed The Moderate Strike; it's funny when it
doesn't have action and has action where there is no plot.  But when there
is no humor, it runs dry, and there are some portions of The Big Hit where
we're just sitting around waiting for the next action sequence.  If you
have two hours to burn and it is matinee time at the local theatre catch
The Big Hit.  Otherwise wait for video.

Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
Why did everyone love The Talented Mr. Ripley?  I can't understand.  Simply 
put up front, I hated The Talented Mr. Ripley.  I thought it was a bore and 
it was nothing special.
Mr. Ripley is Tom Ripley (Matt Damon).  Ripley is a loser who would rather 
be a fake somebody than a real nobody.  Ripley is also a good impersonator 
and is a gifted liar.  As the film opens Ripley meets the parents of Dickie 
Greenleaf (Jude Law).  Dickie's father asks Ripley if he would like to go 
to Italy to get his son Dickie to return to the states.  It seems that 
Dickie has been living off his father's money in Italy with his girlfriend 
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) and has no plans on returning.  Well, Ripley finds 
someone he really wants to be, Dickie.  Dickie is outgoing, personably, and 
extroverted.  Everything Ripley wants.  And a plus is that Dickie's 
girlfriend is not bad either.
I can see how The Talented Mr. Ripley can be an interesting film on someone 
taking someone else identity.  But, writer/director Anthony Minghella does 
it in such a way that I was looking at my watch multiple times during the 
film, I even got up once to look at the DVD jacket to see what the running 
time of the film was (a whopping 2 hours and 20 minutes if you're 
curious).  The sinker for the film isn't bad acting, the three main actors, 
including Damon, are great.  The sinker for the film is the pace.  When the 
murderous dark side of Ripley is shown, it is already past half the 
film.  The first half of the film is sheer boredom.  The second half of the 
film is sheer silliness.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is not what everyone 
says, it's not what the big critics say it is.  This is not a great film, 
it is rather a meandering snore fest with an ending that left me somewhat 
upset that I sat through the whole film.
As I mentioned before, the actors all do wonderful jobs with their 
parts.  Damon shows that he really can act and takes the lead role and 
injects some flair into it.  Damon does well with the Mr. Ripley role as a 
man who is truly confused with what he is and what he has done.  Jude Law 
whom I last saw in the terrible eXistenZ does better in this film (of 
course anything is better then that gore-fest eXistenZ).  Actually, Law 
does quite well in the film portraying the spoiled boy who can only show 
his affection to one person at a time.  And Paltrow does very well as the 
girlfriend who finds out more than she should have and which no one 
believes.  The actors in The Talented Mr. Ripley are great, too bad they 
didn't have a better film to carry their talents to the audience.
Maybe I was being a bit brutal with The Talent Mr. Ripley by saying that I 
hated it.  I dislike the film a lot, but I can't give it a Skip, Skip, Skip 
rating.  The acting talents in the film are too much and if on the off 
chance there is nothing of interest at the rental place, try out The 
Talented Mr. Ripley if you're a patient person and would like to see some 
good acting.  Else, try as hard as you can to find something else to watch, 
there are lots of movies out there that better entertain you for 2 hours 
and 20 minutes than this silly film.

Review for MatchMaker, The (1997)
I first saw Janeane Garofalo in Touch, which she had a small part.  Though
Touch was not a great movie, it was the one in which I fell in love with
Garofalo.  She's had small roles in some recent movies that I've caught,
including the recent Cop Land, but nothing major that I've seen.  The
Matchmaker marks the first film that she is the lead in that I've seen.
And what a wonderful film it is.
Marcy Tizard (Garofalo) works as an aide for Senator John McGlory.  McGlory
is up for re-election and needs something to run with.  He's not a
particularly bright man and that is why his campaign manager Nick Ward
(Denis Leary) is almost in full control of McGlory.  Ward needs something
to help promote the Senator as a "family" man and it is this that brings
him to the idea that they should dig up the genealogy of the Senator, who
is Irish.  Marcy is sent off to Ireland to find out about the Senator's
background.  And this is where the movie really starts.
Marcy is dropped into the Irish town of Ballinagra during it's matchmaking
festival.  It is during the festival that we meet Dermot (Milo O'Shea) who
is one of the town's professional matchmakers.  And with this we start the
romance between Marcy and one of the town's men, Sean (David O'Hare).
Garofalo has a fantastic down-to-earth aura to her, and her cynicism about
almost everything is something that I can 
relate to.  She shows that she has great comic timing and is very charming
all through the movie.  And because she's the lead in this film she is the
only reason to see this film.  Though there are some other things that you
might want to look for.
Milo O'Shea steals every scene that he is in, even the ones that are with
Garofalo.  His matchmaker character is a very memorable character.  O'Hare
is also someone to look for, he underplays his role, but it really works
for the film.
Kudos to the cinematographer who captures the beauty of Ireland.  There is
a moment in the movie where the sights are so awe inspiring that the story
almost gets lost.
The Matchmaker is definitely a date movie that is not to be missed.  It has
some great comedy in it, and I found myself laughing out loud many times
during the showing.  There is also the part that made me tear up, though I
didn't start crying.  All around The Matchmaker is a great showcase film
for Jeneane Garofalo who deserves a big movie like this.  Don't miss The
Matchmaker in the theatres.

Title
Review for Playing God (1997)
The only, though incredibly small, reason to see Playing God is to see
David Duchovny portray a character that is not Fox Mulder from FOX's
popular series "The X-Files." I'm a big "X-Files" fan so I ran out and saw
Playing God because it stars David Duchovny. Was I disappointed?
Eugene Sands (David Duchovny) is a heavy drug user. He was a doctor till he
lost his license; he lost his license after he killed one of his patients
while operating under the influence of drugs. Everyday Sands misses the
opportunity and joy of operating on people and saving their lives. He
regrets losing his license but is unable to kick his drug habit. One night,
on a routine trip to a club to buy his drugs, Sands saves a gunshot victim.
The victim turns out to be a member of a gang that is headed up by Raymond
Blossom (Timothy Hutton). Blossom's girlfriend, Claire (Angelina Jolie),
also witnesses this incident.
Blossom ventures to hire Sands as a "private surgeon" of sorts because he
does not want to send his gang members or friends to the hospital in fear
of the hospital reporting gun shot wounds to the police. Sands is initially
hesitant, but the draw of being able to operate and save lives is too much
for him, and he joins up with Blossom.
This takes place in the first forty-five minutes of the film, and is
actually pretty interesting. The later forty-five minutes though gets done
ala the standard Hollywood action style, lots of guns going off and a very
long car chase. And this is one of the downfalls of Playing God.
The script is another downfall of Playing God. The lines are laughable,
even when they are not meant to be so. The script is filled with mediocre
and lack luster dialogue that feels like it was taken straight out of your
standard made-for-TV-movie.
The performances are decent; Duchovny does well, but nothing really new
here. Jolie has big lips and has little screen time. Hutton goes over the
top as Blossom and it does work sometimes, but his character, as a whole
was unbelievable.
Playing God is at best a made-for-TV-movie. There is not a good reason to
recommend this film unless you are a fan of "The X-Files", and even then,
the film sorely disappointed me. The film runs just a little over 90
minutes, but it seems like it ran over two hours. This is a film to miss on
the big screen and maybe even a film to miss on video.

Review for Avengers, The (1998)
A few months ago I was ask by former director, now turned film critic, Alan
Smithee to be his backup advisor for the film The Avengers. The director,
Jeremiah S. Chechik, wanted to have a film critic on the set to advise him
what to do and what not to do. I found that Smithee was quite an ill man,
and therefore I found myself on the set of The Avengers more than expected.
This would have been great for a budding film critic like me, if it had not
been for a few problems.
Following is a script showing the few times that I was on the set of The
Avengers. All personalities are computer generated.
Chechik hands over a large sum of money.
Chechik hands over piece of paper and a pen. Thurman signs

Review for Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)
"Gigo-Who?"  Deuce Bigalow asks as he meets Antoine the male gigolo.
Did I laugh during Duece Bigalow?  Yes, sporadically, I laughed so loud 
that my family had thought I'd gone nuts.  But, there were also the down 
times in the movie where Duece gets to give big thoughtful speeches, which 
is kind of weird in a comedy like this.
It is nice though to see a comedy like this, a comedy that is sophomoric in 
a lot of the sense, that has a main character who has a heart of gold and 
who cares for the people around him.  Duece Bigalow (Rob Schneider) is a 
fish tank cleaner, who is a loser and cannot get a date.  As fortune has 
it, he ends up fish-sitting for Antoine (Oded Fehr) who is a male gigolo 
("I give women pleasure").  After Antoine leaves, Bigalow gets himself into 
some monetary trouble and ends up dabbling into the gigolo business with 
his Man-Madam T.J. Hicks (Eddie Griffin).  Bigalow becomes a Man-Whore (I 
just had to work that into the review because it just sounds funny, 
Man-Whore).  Well, a romance ensues when he meets a wonderful girl.  But, 
there is always the conflict and in this comedy, the conflict comes from a 
cop named Chuck Fowler (William Forsythe) who is hot on the trail of Hicks 
and Antoine.
I've always liked Schneider.  He's funny without being annoying and that's 
just how he is in Duece Bigalow.  Unlike other comedians who are just plain 
annoying and try to pass that off as funny (Jim Carrey being one of them), 
Schneider is genuinely funny and he does well with the heart-of-gold role 
of Bigalow.  Oded Fehr over does his part as the mean and anal Antoine but 
in the end it all works out.  And Eddie Griffin is good as Hicks, I loved 
the Jacuzzi scenes with the food.  Those were hilarious.  And it is just 
hilarious how he says, "Man-Whore."  The one actor that had me scratching 
my head was William Forsythe.  His scowling detective seemed out of place 
and he just seemed like he was trying to hard.
Overall, Duece Bigalow is a funny film.  It's quite enjoyable and 
well-worth a rental to enjoy on a quiet day.  Duece Bigalow: Male Gigolo 
gets a high recommendation, but lacks enough to get a Don't Miss nod.

Title
Review for Hercules (1997)
I've skipped the last two Disney animated films because of a lack of
motivation to see them.  And I would have missed Hercules also if it were
not for the fact that the guys who did Aladdin are the ones who made Hercules.
Hercules starts off well; I never thought that Greek mythology could be set
to gospel soul music.  The story of Hercules is not true to the myth, but
it is entertaining enough that one can put that aside.  And the kids
wouldn't know the difference.  In Hercules, Zeus (Rip Torn) and Hera
(Samantha Eggar) have a little child, Hercules (Tate Donovan).  Because of
a prediction that Hercules will stop evil Hades' (James Woods) plan to take
over Mount Olympus and the world, one night Hercules is taken away from
Mount Olympus by helpers of Hades.  The two helpers, Pain (Bob Goldthwait)
and Panic (Matt Frewer) take Little Hercules to Earth and feed him formula
to make him a mere mortal.  But, they don't feed him all of it, by
accident, and Hercules becomes a mortal who retains hid godly power.
Hercules is raised by a couple who discover him after Pain and Panic
abandon him.  As a teen Hercules gets outcast because of his amazing
strength and clumsiness.  He discovers that he is the son of Zeus after
becoming depressed.  He wants to be a god and join his father on Mount
Olympus.  In order for this though he needs to be a hero.  On his quest to
be a hero, he meets Meg (Susan Egan), a strong self-reliant woman, for whom
he falls in love with.  But, Meg has other motives, at least that's how it
seems.
Hercules is an above average Disney film.  It does not rise above Disney's
earlier films, Aladdin, Lion King, or Beauty and The Beast.  For me the
biggest thing that defines an animate Disney film is the music.  And though
some of the music is highly entertaining, none of it is memorable.  The
soundtrack to the film, by Alan Menken is just plain boring and uninteresting.
The film itself moves along quickly, and takes chances in places.  It
takes, for instance, the chance to poke fun at the merchandising blitz that
Disney films create.  The animation is well done; I especially enjoyed the
animation for Hades and the (computer generated) multi-headed beast that
Hercules battles.
The person who seems to be having the most fun is James Woods as Hades.
His Woods is all over the places and comes close to Robin Williams as the
Genie in Aladdin.  Woods does don't hold back, and is one of two people in
Hercules that is memorable.  Susan Egan as Meg also memorable.  Her strong
and sexy Meg is pure entertainment.  She is the exact opposite of being the
typical damsel-in-distress.
Hercules is an entertaining but flawed film.   If you'r a parent and have
children wanting to go see it in the theatres, you don't need to worry,
Hercules is entertaining on two levels.  You won't be bored.  I am
recommending Hercules but not with too much conviction, there and better
animated Disney films.

Title
Review for Abyss, The (1989)
The Abyss was release to theatres unfinished, in my mind and that of the
director James Cameron. That is why Cameron went back and added 30 plus
minutes of cut footage.
The footage was cut, not because Cameron wanted too, but because the studio
thought that no one would sit and watch a three-hour film. The studios were
wrong; the cuts resulted in a film that confused audiences.
The Abyss starts off with a bang. A US nuclear submarine tracks a strange
high-speed object travelling through the water. The skipper of the boat
wants to investigate and gets into trouble. Moreover the sub runs into the
wake of the object and smashes into a canyon.
The Navy needs to get the warheads off the sub, but they cannot get a crew
as far down as the sub is at. The Navy calls upon a deep sea drilling crew
located on a one of a kind deep-sea oilrig. Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio) designed the rig. She's a tough woman who is hard to get
along with and nobody really likes her and she's just flown in to help with
the rescue operation.
Down below, on the rig, we have a rag-tag group of workers. Bud Brigman (Ed
Harris) leads these people. Bud and Lindsey have been divorced a few years
ago, and Bud is not expecting Lindsey to come down. Sent down to the rig
are a group of Navy SEALs. The group of SEALs are led by Lt. Coffey
(Micheal Biehn).
Writer/Director James Cameron spins up many plot threads in The Abyss,
including one about aliens in the water. It is this plot thread that
suffers the most with the original cuts. I often hear my friends, after
seeing the original version, talk about how the first two-thirds of the
film are rather normal, and then the end takes a strange tangent with the
aliens. And of those, that saw the original version, they did not
understand why the aliens were doing what they were doing. The restored
footage is added for that exact reason.
Another thread plot also suffers from the original cuts. This is the thread
that follows the relationship between Bud and Lindsey. The restored footage
adds much background on their relationship.
Cameron who is known for his big budget special effect driven action film
does not hold back on The Abyss. He does though rearrange the priorities.
The film focuses on the characters heavily, developing some interesting
relationships. The special effects are spectacular, but they never get to
the point of being the driving force behind the film. There is action, but
it also is not the driving force behind the film. He makes the characters
and their stories the driving force behind the film.
What I found interesting about the film is the theme of cleansing and the
small, though direct, religious undertone. Cameron puts the aliens in the
sea, and makes the aliens powerful beings that are able to control the
forces of water. After seeing the humans on ground go through so much, and
killing so many other humans, the aliens put up a very unambiguous warning
for mankind. Stop killing each other or face another Biblical scale flood.
The additional footage shows this clearly.
Known as the hardest film shoot ever, we find out why. Cameron decided from
the git-go to shoot The Abyss wet-for-wet. What wet-for-wet means is that
every shot that has an actor in the water is actually an actor in the
water. That is opposed to a wet-for-dry shoot where scenes with actors are
shot on a foggy soundstage with blue filters on the cameras.
Many people have expressed that The Abyss is a long confusing film. But,
most of those have only seen the original theatrical release of the film.
The director's cut of the film fixes all of the problems of the original
release. With the extra 30 minutes of footage The Abyss is a complete film,
worthy of the three hour running time. Don't miss the director's cut of
this film. Unlike other director's cut films which add only periphery
details such as more special effects or short small additions. The Abyss SE
adds more story and clears up a lot of the confusion of the original release.
Cameron did the Director's Cut of The Abyss not directly on video but on
film. Here in the San Francisco Bay Area it has been shown a few times in
small art houses. If you can't catch it on the big screen, the Director's
Cut is also available on laserdisc. Don't miss this version of The Abyss.
"Hold on to your pantyhose." - Bud Brigman.

Review for Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995)
The third in the Die Hard Trilogy, Die Hard: With a Vengeance marks the
return of John McTiernan to the series. Vengeance also marks the first time
that Die Hard has veered from it's original formula. There really is no
enclosed space in Die Hard: With a Vengeance. In Die Hard it was John
McClane in the Nakatomi building. In Die Hard 2 it was John McClane in the
Dulles Airport. There is a hint of sticking to the original formula, but
that is a long draw of the imagination, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is John
McClane in New York City. In Vengeance McClane is no longer alone either
and it is also not Christmas.
John McClane is down and out in New York. He's on suspension from his
department and he's lying around at home drinking and well, lying around.
That is until someone takes an interest in him. This special someone wants
to be called Simon and Simon wants to play a simple game with McClane,
"Simon Says". Though this set up is pretty simple as the movie progresses
we begin to see what is really happening and why Simon is playing games
with McClane and the rest of the New York Police Department.
Forced into the situation is Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) Carver, a black
storeowner who saves McClane's life early on in the film. Zeus is a great
add-on and provides much of the comic relief with McClane. The two of them
squabble like the Odd Couple but they are forced to work together by Simon.
And together they must solve a few puzzles that Simon has set out for them;
or else something big will blow up.
The opening sequence for Die Hard: With a Vengeance packs a mighty punch. I
have not seen any movie open quite like Vengeance, the opening sequence
literally grabs your attention and holds on to it. I commend McTiernan for
such a great opening.
The one thing that I did not like about Vengeance is its running time. The
movie runs almost two and half-hours, which is a bit long for an action
movie. Though there is a lot of story to be told in Vengeance, some stuff
could have been cut out for time issues. The biggest thing that shows this
is the anti-climatic ending. I thought the film was over, but then the film
continued on for, it almost seemed, another 15 to 20 minutes. This is OK
though because McTiernan is able to set up some good action sequences with
the puzzles that Simon has set up. My favourite of this film includes
McClane surfing and a wide ride through the park.
Though a bit long, Die Hard: With a Vengeance packs a punch that starts
from the opening scene and lasts till the end. There is enough action
packed into this film to satisfy two films, but it never wears the audience
out. And that is the brilliance of Die Hard: With a Vengeance, it is a well
put together film that is good enough to keep the audience in check while
still blowing them away with some pretty spectacular action sequences.
McTiernan shows that he still has the eye for good action. Don't miss Die
Hard: With a Vengeance.

Title
Review for Broken Arrow (1996)
If you know me well enough, you know that I'm a big John Woo fan.  And this
makes it hard for me to review his films.  I'll try to put this bias aside
for this review of his second US film.
Two Air Force officers take up a B-3 experimental bomber with two nuclear
bombs in the bomb bay.  They are going to be flying over the Utah while
being tracked by a ground station to see if they can be caught.  Riley Hale
(Christian Slater) slyly says before take-off, "When the time comes that we
have to go to war against Utah, we are really going to kick ass, you know?"
 During mid-flight Vic Deakins (John Travolta) tries to kill his co-pilot
Riley Hale in order to jettison the nuclear bombs.  We find out later that
Deakins is working with a businessman, Mr. Pritchett (Bob Gunton), and they
plan to make a load of cash with these nuclear devices.
Something goes wrong during the mid-flight fight and Hale is ejected while
Deakins jettisons the bombs and also ejects.  Hale meets up with a park
ranger (Samantha Mathis) and together they try to stop Deakins and his band
of military men from taking off with the nuclear weapons.
The script is by Graham Yost, whose last script was Speed.  Yost, who as
we've seen with Speed and now with Broken Arrow, is not a great writer.
His scripts need the help of a good director to come out on top, and with
both Speed (directed by Jan De Bont) and now Broken Arrow, he got what he
needed, and the films come out on top.  Yost needs to work on writing more
believable and less silly dialogue (while running down a hill to catch some
Humvees carrying the nukes, Mathis' character says to herself, "This isn't
a good idea."  Duh..)  What we don't see in Broken Arrow, as we do in Woo's
previous Hong Kong releases and in Face/Off, is the blurred difference
between the good and bad characters.  In Broken Arrow the characters are
either good or bad.
Woo looks to have gotten more freedom on this project he did in his debut
US film Hard Target.  He pulls out his bag of tricks and uses them to the
fullest.  These included the-endless-gun-magazine, the slow-mo, and the
double-fisted gunfights.  These all make for incredibly fun action that is
visually inspiring.
Worth mentioning is Hans Zimmer's score for the film.  He knows how to
create themes for characters, and he shows this with his very memorable
theme for John Travolta's character Vic Deakins.
Broken Arrow is a loud, sometimes dumb, movie about two dueling Air Force
pilots, which is basically a long chase movie.  Suspension of disbelief is
a necessity for this film, but if you can suspend your disbelief, Broken
Arrow can be enjoyed for its amazing and visually stunning action.

Title
Review for Red Corner (1997)
If I were asked to give a one-line synopsis of Red Corner it would sound
like this: Perry Mason in China. Red Corner is nothing but a bad episode of
Perry Mason set in China.
Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is a businessman in China. He is trying to sell
his satellite TV programming to the Chinese government. While taking the
night on the town Moore meets a beautiful model and takers her to his hotel
room for a night of sex. The next morning Moore is dragged out of bed
covered in her blood by the Chinese police. He is held in prison awaiting
his trial, which might prove to be short since the Chinese legal system
believes that leniency, is given to those who confess their crimes.
Moore is assigned a Chinese lawyer, Shen Yuelin (Bai Ling), who at first
believes that Moore is guilty, but after some evidence is shown, she begins
to change her mind. What follows is a look into the Chinese legal system
and some heavy-handed anti-China preaching.
The problem with Red Corner is that it is basically a typical made-for-TV
thriller that is set, unnecessarily, in China. The legal system that it
tries to show is one that is not much different from the US legal system,
and in some cases it looks as if it is much better. For example, Moore
escapes from the Chinese police and runs amok in the streets of Beijing.
When he is caught and brought back to the courthouse, nothing happens to
him. No further charges put against him, nothing. If he were in the US,
that would have been a different case.
Another problem with Red Corner is the uninspired script. Everything is so
cliched, especially the courtroom scenes. These scenes include everything
you would find in a typical made-for-TV court movie, including the surprise
witness, the surprise revelation by the accused, and the real killer
spilling his guts on the stand after a strong questioning session with the
lawyers. Moreover, Gere gives a bland performance in this film, and in some
of the supposed high-tension court scenes it is he who brings them down.
Whatever political beliefs Gere might hold against China, his performance
in Red Corner shows none of that.
The only thing that I enjoyed in Red Corner was the performance of newcomer
Bai Ling as Moore's attorney Yuelin. Ling has a commanding screen presence
and she, by far, outshines anything that this film puts out, especially the
performance of the big-budget A-list Gere.
Also interesting to see is how the filmmakers were able to make the film
feel as if it were shot in China. The Chinese government did not allow the
filmmakers to shoot in China for obvious reasons and the film makers had to
resort different measures to "create" China for the film; from scale models
to computer integration. Most of these effects aren't noticeable during the
film which is why it is interesting to see it.
Red Corner is, at times, implausible and a slow moving film. It tries to
show the inner works of the Chinese legal system, but doesn't accomplish
it. The whole film feels like a long bad episode of Perry Mason set in a
far away land that has the same laws, as does the US. Richard Gere who is
supposed to carry this film does not even come close, but it is new comer
Bai Ling's performance which is what is to be seen in this film. I cannot
recommend Red Corner if you are going to see it for its story. But, if
during a matinee, you have nothing better to see, see Red Corner for Bai
Ling's performance.
"Wow, the Chinese legal system is just like ours!" - audience member I
overheard as I was leaving the theatre.

Title
Review for Excess Baggage (1997)
Some movies start with such potential and then rise even more, blowing away
our expectations. Excess Baggage has so much potential. The plot has a
catchy proposition, which gives it so much potential. But, never does it
rise more below the catchy opening, it even sinks below that.
Alicia Silverstone is a neglected daughter of a rich man. He seems to care
more about his dirty business dealings than about his daughter. She is a
mischievous girl that has a bad history. To give you an idea of her
mischief, she has a news article about herself framed on her dresser. The
news article is about her burning down the school library.
In an attempt to both get her father's attention and test to see if he
really does love her, she sets up an elaborate scheme. She makes as if she
is kidnapped (herself being the kidnapper), demands money, ties herself up
and locks herself into her car trunk. What she didn't expect was a
professional car thief, played by Benicio Del Toro, who, unknowingly,
steals her car before the police can get to it. After meeting the two
develop a relationship.
The first production out of Alicia Silverstone's company, First Kiss, this
is not a great start. The genre is hard to pin point. It's not a romantic
film because there is hardly any romance or chemistry between Silverstone's
Emily Hope and Del Toro's Vincent Roche. It's not a comedy because, well,
it's not funny. It's not a drama because it can't be taken seriously. It's
not an action film because of the action in the film, most of it falls
flat. You get the idea.
Christopher Walken, who I really don't admire or prefer to watch, shows
again why I don't. He seems to play the same role over and over again. (I
did though love his short role in Pulp Fiction, but next to that, I find it
hard to find another film that I enjoyed his work in.)
Del Toro gives a low key performance, and it works. Silverstone gives a
strange uneven performance, and for her part it works to an extent. But,
all their time on screen together generates nothing; there just is no
chemistry between the two.
Excess Baggage is a weak film that I almost walked out on many times during
the film. I do respect the film makers enough to ride out the rest of the
film to see if there any divine intervention occur during the film that
could change it. In the end though, I was disappointed. Excess Baggage is a
film to skip on screen and on video.

Review for Jacob's Ladder (1990)
Jacob's Ladder is a film that will take you down that dark tunnel with the
light at the end.  But, the trip down the dark tunnel is not pleasant.
Jacob's Ladder takes us through the turmoil of the tunnel through the eyes
of its main character Jacob (Tim Robbins) Singer.
As the film opens, Jacob is in a quiet village in Vietnam.  It's the middle
of the Vietnam War, but Jacob's group seems to have found some quiet time.
A joint is passed around, there's idle chatter, and there's nothing serious
on the horizon.  That is until there is movement in the tree line.  All
hell breaks loose and frantic combat breaks out.  No one knows what's
happening, not even the audience.  This mass confusion is a foreshadowing
for the rest of the film.  As the combat comes to an end, an unseen enemy
bayonets Jacob in the abdomen.
Flash forward a few years past the war, Jacob is on a subway train riding
home.  He's now a postman with a doctorate degree in philosophy.  He's
divorced from his wife and is living with a beautiful co-worker, Jezebel
(Elizabeth Pena).  Everything seems fine for Jacob, but it's not.  He
starts to see images of demons.  Little glimpses at first  things that
wouldn't make much sense but wouldn't arouse your attention either  but as
the days pass, the demonic images continue to haunt him, they get darker
and more intense.
Jacob's only handle on what is happening to him is through his chiropractor
Louis (Danny Aiello).  Throughout the film we are shaken up by flashbacks
to Vietnam and to Jacob's previous life with his wife Sarah and their
children, one of who is dead.
The structure of Jacob's Ladder is brilliant, though not original.  This
structure, which I can't name because it will ruin the film experience for
those who haven't seen it yet, has been used in books before and can be
misused.  But, writer Bruce Joel Rubin puts together a script that takes
your emotions and drains them, leaving even the happiest person depressed.
There is a hope-filled ending, but the truest form of this film is of
death.  Throughout the film we, like Jacob, are unsure of what really
happened during the attack in Vietnam.  Jacob, halfway through the film,
asks, `Am I dead?'  And we're left to think if he is or not.
The film explores not life, but death.  What really happens during those
last fleeting moments of life?  What really are demons and angels?  Rubin
who wrote the crowd-pleaser film Ghost takes a big risk with writing
Jacob's Ladder.  This is a film that is, in every way, un-Hollywood.
Jacob's Ladder is as original as movies come.  Kudos to Rubin for writing
this amazing film.
Adrian Lyne who is known more for his commercial films such as Flashdance
tackles this film with the utmost honesty.  Showing Jacob's struggles with
what is happening around and to him unfiltered.  Lyne tones down the
supernatural portions of Rubin's script and brings a real-worldness to the
film, making the film that much more horrific.  The images that Lyne
presents on screen are of Hell on Earth.  Lyne doesn't rely on gore or
slashers to scare you, but lets the story and the images put the fear into
you.  This film can be seen as either a trip straight to Hell or a journey
to Heaven.  It just depends on how you look it.
Tim Robbins is perfectly cast as Jacob.  Robbins has innocence in his face
that is used well to show the reaction to the chaos that has suddenly
filled his life.  As Jacob's life is spiraling down to Hell, Robins is able
to bring us with him on this dark journey.  And by the end of the film we
are with Jacob as the ultimate happens.  Robbins's portrayal of Jacob is
dead on.  Kudos to Robbins for a brilliant performance.  Elizabeth Pena
also turns in a wonderful performance as Jezebel the mysterious woman in
Jacob's life.  The mere name that is given to her character makes for some
interesting Biblical imagery.
I saw this film nine years ago while I was still in high school.  The film,
at the time, influenced me much on how I look at life and how I look at
films.  And although I enjoy the current crop of films that are being
turned out, there hasn't been any film as daring as Jacob's Ladder to do
what it does -- Jacob's Ladder gets into your head, it twists things around
and leaves you reeling.  Instead of using special effects Jacob's Ladder
uses ideas, images, and quick glimpses to horrify you.  Once in your head,
Jacob's Ladder is there for good.
Jacob's Ladder is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  The film is not a happy
experience, but it is one that shows just what gets created when filmmakers
are willing to take risks.  The script by Bruce Joel Rubin and the steady
handed direction from Adrian Lyne coupled with the imagery shot by Jeffrey
Kimball all work to frighten you psychologically.  These elements also work
to make you think, and by the end of the film I'll guarantee you that
you'll be thinking and mulling over the film for a long time to come.
Don't Miss Jacob's Ladder.  I screened the special edition of Jacob's
Ladder available on DVD.  After watching the film, let me know what you
think about what happened to Jacob.

Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
Zorro is the first true action hero of this summer, and maybe of the last
few summers. And for the price of admission you get not one Zorro, but two!
A detailed explanation of the underlying plot for The Mask of Zorro is an
exercise in futility. It deals with Don Montero (Staurt Wilson) trying to
buy California. The story that drives the movie is that of the relationship
between the elder Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) and the new Zorro (Antonio
Banderas).
Each Zorro has his own problems to solve. The elder Zorro wants revenge on
Montero for killing his wife, stealing, and raising his daughter. Young
Zorro seeks revenge against a corrupt US Calvary man, Captain Love (Matthew
Letscher), for killing his brother. Young Zorro is also romantically
attracted to Elder Zorro's daughter. The daughter of Elder Zorro, Elena
(Catherine Zeta Jones) was stolen and raised by Don Montero. She slowly
finds small clues to who she is.
Though there are some gun fights in The Mask of Zorro, the largest chunk of
action uses swords and not guns. This makes for some exciting swashbuckling
fun, unlike many of the films currently playing onscreen. I was happy to
see a movie that does not rely on gunfights to generate excitement. Kudos
to director Martin Campbell for keeping the sword fights exciting and fresh
instead of going the gun battle route.
Talking about Campbell, he seems to be the guy that can revive anything. He
has a knack for making so-old-it's-cool type films. Campbell's last film
was GoldenEye, which single-handedly revived the James Bond franchise. Now,
it looks like he has also revitalized the Zorro franchise.
As kids, my sister and I watched re-runs of the black and white Zorro
episodes on TV, so I was quite delighted to see that there was going to be
a big screen version of Zorro. I stepped into the theatre expected a lot
and was not disappointed when I left.
What can you say about Anthony Hopkins? To begin with, he is one of the
best actors around. And with Zorro, he shows that not only can he act, he
can handle swordplay with no problems. Hopkins is wonderful in The Mask of
Zorro.
Antonio Banderas has not had a real big-screen hit, but I believe The Mask
of Zorro will be his first. Banderas lights up the screen with his casual
charm. He is the perfect Zorro. What I loved about Bandera's Zorro was that
the character was suave, but also had some flaws. Look for the scene in
which he is surround by an army of men after trying to steal a horse. Also
look ashe tries to jump onto his horse like the elder Zorro.
The one to watch for is Zeta Jones, though. A relative newcomer to the
bigscreen, Zeta Jones lights up the screen. She has a zest that is
indescribable. The chemistry between her and Banderas is some of the best
I've seen lately. I love the scene in which she catches Banderas's Zorro
trying to steal a horse.
The script by Terry Rossio, Ted Elliott, and John Eskow has enough action
to keep our attention. The dialogue is snappy and funny. The script is
somewhat convoluted and hard to understand, but this really doesn't matter
because of Campbell's excellent direction. The film runs a bit long and
there are things that feel out of place. For instance, the Montero's gold
mine looks so fake that it feels as if it belongs in some Las Vegas hotel.
The score by James Horner is well done, especially taking into account that
his last score for Deep Impact was as generic as it could be. The score for
The Mask of Zorro is quite listenable.
Overall, The Mask of Zorro is an exciting film and a good escapist movie.
It is a fun film and I highly recommend it for everyone who is sick of all
the gunfights in motion pictures lately. The swashbuckling sword fights are
worth admission itself, but the movie producers decide to give us more and
give us two Zorros for the price of one.

Review for Return of the Jedi (1983)
RETURN OF THE JEDI SPECIAL EDITION (1997)
"Die Ewoks!  Die!"  This is the phrase my Star Wars friends and I
chant after every viewing of Return of the Jedi.  Return of the Jedi
could have been a good, no, great ending for the Star Wars Trilogy but
there were those damn Ewoks.
After finding out that his father was Darth Vader in The Empire
Strikes back, Luke Skywalker and his friends set out to end the reign
of The Empire once and for all.  What the Rebels find out is that The
Empire has been working hard on another Death Star, this time bigger
and better than the original.  What are the Rebels to do but to
destroy the Death Star again and claim victory?  But, first Luke and
Leia must rescue Han Solo, who was carbon frozen in The Empire Strikes
back.
Return of the Jedi was the long awaited finale to the Star Wars
Trilogy.  Given the brilliance of the predecessors, Return of the Jedi
should have been the best of the series.
There are some great qualities about Return of the Jedi.  The movie
was made far enough later than the original Star Wars that the special
effects were perfected enough to create a huge space battle.  The
space battle near the end of the movie is well crafted and fun to
watch.  The story about Darth Vader and his redemption is great.  The
story about Luke and his quest to stay with the Light Side of the
Force is also good.  The evil Emperor is cool also.  And it was great
to see Yoda back again, though so briefly.
What stunk about Return of the Jedi are those damn Ewoks.  A blatant
aim at commercial success in the after-movie market, the Ewoks were
introduced.  I'm sure most of you know who the Ewoks are already, but
for those of you who don't, the Ewoks are a bunch of cuddly looking
teddy bear like creatures that live in the forests of Endor.  The
Ewoks are cute and make for great stuff animals that kids will beg for
once they step out of the theatre.  But for us Star Wars fans the
Ewoks are a plain insult.  These snuggly cuddly creatures should have
been digitally erased during the Special Edition production.  They are
plain annoying and ruin the mood for most of Return of the Jedi.
For the Special Edition there was not much added to the film.  The
film itself is so new that most of the special effects still look
pretty good.  What was added, and is most noticeable is the end
sequence.  Instead of the plain Rebel celebration with the Ewoks, we
now get to see a grant universal scale celebration.  This end
sequence, with new music from John Williams, changes the overall feel
of the Trilogy for the better.
Overall, Return of the Jedi is a good film.  But I wish that Lucas
would have done something with those Ewoks.  Don't Miss Return of the
Jedi Special Edition, even if you've seen the original Return of the
Jedi.  The ending is much better in the Special Edition form.

Review for Touch (1997/I)
When Get Shorty came out, I was not too excited to see it.  I wondered what 
was so wonderful about that movie.  And when it came down to it, I did miss 
the movie in the theatres.  But, after many recommendations later on from 
co-workers, I went out and rented the movie to watch.  And what a wonderful 
movie.  The best part of the movie was the dialog.  The movie was filled with 
great dialog.  I regretted not seeing Get Shorty in the theatres, so when 
Touch, another movie based on a Elmore Leonard novel, came out I rush out to 
see it.
Touch is about a young man, named Juvenal, who bleeds from his palms and heals 
with his touch.  Touch is also about a woman, Lynn Faulkner, played by Bridget 
Fonda, who falls in love with Juvenal unexpectedly.  Christopher Walken plays 
a snake-skin-boot-wearing-television-evangelist-turned-RV-salesman who weasels 
his way into becoming Juvenal's agent.  Tom Arnold plays a crazed religious 
activist.
The movie is feels split between two completely different stories.  One is 
about the relationship that is building between Juvenal and Lynn.  The other 
is about Walken's character and Arnold's character trying to get access to 
Juvenal.  The relationship story has potential, the other story has a cheap 
feeling to it.  As if the writers needed something to be the conflict that 
pushed the relationship story.  Arnold heavily overplays his part and most of 
the time makes it feel as if his character really didn't belong in this movie. 
 Walken's character is not overplayed by Walken, but its over stressed by the 
director.  How many shots of his snake skin boots do we need to see to figure 
out that he is not an honest guy?  Fonda and Ulrich do a good job with their 
parts.
The movie has a cheap low-budget feel to it.  And there are cheezy lines 
spouted as, "Controversy is the oxygen I breathe!"
Did I enjoy any part of the movie?  Yes, I did.  I enjoyed the parts of the 
movie when Janeane Garofalo was on screen.  She is a cynical publisher in the 
movie, and plays it right on the money.  She is funny in all the scenes that 
she has, and is just about the whole comedy part of the movie.
All in all, I wish that I had seen this on video or better yet on cable, and I 
still want to see Get Shorty on the big screen.  If you're planning to see 
this, wait till it hits the small screen, it's just not worth seeing in the 
theatres.

Review for True Lies (1994)
James Cameron has a reputation for his heavy, serious, special effects
laden films. True Lies is a change from what is expected from him, kind of.
True Lies is by far a bloated film. It starts off well enough, a story
about a super-spy character, Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who
lives a double life. His two lives consist of one as a super-spy and
another as a father/husband. His priorities seem to be more towards being a
super-spy. He is tracking a bad guy from the Middle East and must stop him
from using the nuclear warheads that possesses.
This would have been a great film, but Cameron, who wrote the script, stops
everything and puts in a story about Harry and his ordinary housewife
(Jamie Lee Curtis). The story follows Harry as he vengefully spies and
follows his wife around trying to find out if she is cheating on him. And
Harry is just not someone we like after what he puts his wife through in
the luxury hotel suite. This whole mid-portion of the film just does not
work, and bogs a rather good action film. The comedy that Cameron tries to
introduce using this portion of the film does not work at all. Moreover it
puts Harry in bad light, making him look like a vengeful abusive husband.
The action sequences in True Lies are complicated and well done. Cameron
shows that he knows how to do action. His highlight action sequences are an
opening escape from a mansion, a fight scene in a bathroom (which strangely
ends up on a rooftop), and an ending Harrier sequence that has to been seen
to be believed. As always, Cameron's action is staged in such a way that
it's over-the-top. Suspension of belief is needed for his action sequences,
and once that is achieved they can be enjoyed.
If Cameron had focused on Harry's problem with the terrorist, this film
would have ended up a fun film. As it stands, at almost two and a half
hours, it's a bit long and the mid-section is not something that is worth
sitting through to get to the action. Is True Lies fun? Almost. Should you
see True Lies? If you have the time to sit through some painfully bad
attempts at humor to get some spectacular action sequences. 

Title
Review for Star Wars (1977)
I was two years old when the original Star Wars: A New Hope was released
theatrically. So, the only exposure of Star Wars, and the subsequent
additions to the story, for me were by video. That is until the Special
Edition of Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of The Jedi was
introduced to the big screen.  And because I've been a Star Wars fan ever
since I saw the Death Star trench run on video when I was six or seven, I
was ecstatic when I heard that the Special Edition of the Star Wars Trilogy
was being re-released to the big screen.
To try to tell or synopsize the Star Wars story would be a waste of time.
The story of Star Wars is so ingrained into our culture that it's hard to
find someone who is not familiar with the story and the characters.
Everyone knows about the Death Star, the Millenium Falcon, X-Wings, Tie
Fighters and Star Destroyers. Everyone knows about Luke Skywalker, Han
Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, C-3P0, and R2-D2. And who can
forget the familiar words, "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"
right before the fanfare music by the great composer John Williams?
George Lucas, on the 20th anniversary of the original release of Star Wars:
A New Hope wanted to "complete" his work. He always felt that his original
release was somewhat "incomplete" because he could not achieve what he
wanted with the technology in 1977. So, now that the digital revolution has
taken Hollywood by storm, Lucas has taken advantage of this new technology
and completed his work.
There are far more additions into Star Wars: A New Hope Special Edition
than into either of the other two. Rightfully so because the original a
much older film than the other two following it. At the time that the
original was being made, Lucas and company had to invent most of the
special effects technology to accomplish much of what was done in the
original film. And to that effect, Lucas and company was also limited to
what they could do with this new technology. With STSE, Lucas is able to go
back and fill in what he could not have done at the time.
Star Wars was more than just special effects though -- unlike most modern
day special effects driven films out of Hollywood -- Star Wars was a film
that balanced the special effects with a story so well told that by itself,
the story could hold the audience's attention. Maybe it is right that STSE
is being re-released 20 years after it originally set the stage for so many
sci-fi special effects driven films. STSE shows how a good sci-fi film does
not need to rest on its special effects, rather a good sci-fi film should
rest on the story.
Star Wars is a classic film that will outlive its creator and the hard
working people who made it happen. And it does deserve this, for it is a
classic film that everyone should see. If you're one of those who hasn't
already seen Star Wars, don't miss this film, in its Special Edition or
original form.  Cheers to George Lucas for introducing the world to such a
wonderful set of characters and to such a great timeless tale.

Title
Review for Kiss the Girls (1997)
Kiss the Girls is not quite SE7EN, but not quite bad either. Kiss the Girls
is a good serial killer movie that entertains for two hours.
After seeing the previews, I thought Kiss the Girls might be a blatant
rip-off of SE7EN. It has Morgan Freeman, who was in SE7EN and it has an
intelligent serial killer whose identity is not known. Also, it is a movie,
like SE7EN, that is more interested in why the killer is doing what he is
doing more than about catching the killer. Catching the killer is only the
means of driving the movie forward.
Morgan Freeman is Dr. Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist. He finds himself
going to Durham, North Carolina to help out on an abduction case, the
abducted happens to be his niece. What he finds when he gets there is that
his niece is only one of many girls kidnapped by a serial rapist and killer
who calls himself Casanova. Ashley Judd is Kate McTiernan the only woman to
escape from Casanova (she knows kickboxing). Together Cross and McTiernan
go on the hunt for Casanova.
The movie is somewhat predictable. The most predictable is the identity of
Casanova, whom I guessed correctly after the credits finished. (Director
Gary Fleder should have taken note that David Fincher chose to not include
the name of the actor portraying the serial killer in SE7EN during the
opening credits). By the time the end rolls around, Fleder throws the
audience a fake bone to try to trick us into thinking that Casanova is
someone else, but it doesn't work.
It is quite easy to think that a comparison can be drawn between Kiss the
Girls and SE7EN, but the differences are there. Here's some: the ending to
SE7EN was quite a surprise and quite shocking. The ending to Kiss the Girls
is of the standard Hollywood fare. John Doe in SE7EN had a clear-cut
purpose for what he was doing. Doe had a message that he was preaching.
Casanova has a purpose to his madness also, but it is not so clear.
Casanova does spread the word of what he does, but he has no message that
he wants to preach. Though Director Fleder handles the director's duties
just fine, he doesn't come close to making the film look as good as Fincher
does.
With all this said, Kiss the Girls in the end is entertaining. This is
because of the great performances by the two leads. Freeman is always a
command presence on screen, and that does not change here with Kiss the
Girls. His performance is intense. Judd adds yet another great performance
to her list of great performances. She does very well in Kiss the Girls.
Though not as good as SE7EN, which Kiss the Girls will inevitably be
compared to, Kiss the Girls is nonetheless entertaining. It has its
frightening moments and its share of action. And it comes as a fairly
interesting film about a serial killer. This is a Don't Miss film, though
see it at a matinee showing. 

Title
Review for Space Jam (1996)
Michael Jordan in a film, why not?  He's done just about everything else.
Space Jam is a strange mix of biography and fiction.  Taking from the life
of Jordan and mixing that with the Looney Tunes.  Space Jam takes place
somewhere between Jordan ending his baseball career and starting back with
basketball.  The story involves aliens from the planet Moron Mountain, who
need some new attractions for their theme park.  It seems that the patrons
of Moron Mountain are just bored with the current attractions.
Accidentally they run into the Looney Tunes on TV.  So, five little aliens
are dispatched to take the Looney Tunes back to Moron Mountain. But, in a
turn of events, they have to challenge the Tunes to a game of basketball.
The Tunes think they have it made out for them, until the little aliens
morph into super star basketball players.  The Tunes need some help, who
else can the call upon but the basketball great, Michael Jordan?
The biggest attraction in Space Jam is not as much Michael and his
basketball skills, but the well integration of animation with live action.
The animation consists of a mix of computer-generated animation and cell
animation.  Bugs, Daffy, Taz, and friends look better than ever.
Michael Jordan in his first movie role does well.  Though this is not
saying much since his role is not all that taxing.  Other basketball
players, such as Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing, are also featured, but
only in brief.  The real stars of Space Jam are the Looney Tunes.  The
Tunes are a hoot to watch, like always.
Space Jam is a wonderfully entertaining movie that is well suited for both
the adults and the children. Don't miss this one. 

Title
Review for Shakespeare in Love (1998)
Shakespeare in Love is a film that I love to love. There are films which I
like so much that my reviews are shorter than usually because a film review
is half criticism and half pointing out the what to look for. If the film
is as good as Shakespeare in Love, there's not a lot to criticize, just
good things to point out. Shakespeare in Love is a perfect mix of different
genres: a romance, a comedy, and a drama. It all works out to make
Shakespeare in Love one of 1998s best films.
There are two battling theatres in Shakespeare in Love; the Rose Theatre
which has the fairly green screenwriter Shakespeare and the Curtain Theatre
that has the ever-popular Marlowe (Rupert Everett).
Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) is working on Romeo and Juliet (which has the
working title of "Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter"). The owner of
the Rose Theatre, Henslowe (Geoffrey Rush), is badly in need of a play to
bring his theatre out of the rubbles, to pay his debts, and to save his
feet (you'll learn early on in the film what I mean by the last part).
Henslowe's secret weapon is Shakespeare. Though at the time Shakespeare is
nothing but a playwright with writer's block. The owner of the Curtain
Theatre thinks that Shakespeare is an up-and-coming playwright and wants to
have Shakespeare writing plays for the Curtain Theatre. Shakespeare forgoes
working for the Curtain Theatre after a startling discovery. He falls into
a bit of depression after making the discovery and his writer's block gets
even worse  that is until he meets the daughter of a rich man, Viola De
Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow). But, as stories go, it turns out that Viola is
going to be married in two weeks. What is Shakespeare to do?
Is Shakespeare in Love based on a true story? It really doesn't matter. The
film is so entertaining that it could stand by itself. The humour in
Shakespeare in Love is off-the-wall and screwball. There are many
Shakespeare references, so many that I couldn't catch them all. If you've
read any Shakespeare, there will  be some Shakespeare references in this
film that will make you chuckle.
John Madden directs Shakespeare in Love. Kudos to Madden for putting
together such a wonderful film based on the script by Marc Norman and Tom
Stoppard. The script is a magnificent piece of work that shows just how
well a movie can be written. Kudos to Norman and Stoppard.
As for performances in the film: They are all top-notch. Paltrow is
effervescent onscreen. Fiennes is the perfect cast for Shakespeare. And
Geoffrey Rush, whom I did not recognize until I saw the credits, is
hilarious. The supporting players are all wonderful. Kudos to everyone in
the film for their all around brilliant performances. Look for Ben Afflect
in the film, his presence is amusing.
If I write anymore about Shakespeare in Love I risk drooling all over the
review, this is a film that you can't miss on the big screen. Don't Miss
Shakespeare in Love. And take a significant other with you to see this
romantic and sweet film.

Review for Rock, The (1996)
Many men have died behind enemy lines, and the US Government has chosen to 
forget them.  Well, this has to stop now, and General Francis X Hummel (Ed 
Harris) will do this.
Hummel along with a small group of Marines have taken over Alcatraz, and taken 
81 hostages.  The rescue of the hostages would be easy if not for the batch of 
rockets that the General has pointed at the San Francisco Bay Area.  The 
rockets aren't standard rockets either.  They are armed with the highly lethal 
VX gas.
The Pentagon has two solutions.  One is to bomb the island with bombs that 
will incinerate the deadly VX gas upon contact.  But this solution will also 
take the lives of all the hostages.  The second solution is to attempt a 
nighttime raid on the island with a small group of Navy Seals.  But no one 
knows how to get into the fortress island.  Except for the only man to ever 
escape the island, John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery).  Mason is imprisoned for 
stealing government secrets 30 years ago.  And if they get into the fortress 
island, can they disable the rockets?  Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) is a 
chemical expert who specializes in deadly gases such as the VX gas.  Mason is 
let out of prison to help the SEAL team get on the island.  Goodspeed is going 
to the island to disable the rockets.
The driving force behind Goodspeed to disable all the rockets is the knowledge 
that his pregnant fiancee (the beautiful Vanessa Marcil) has flown into San 
Francisco and is now in danger of being killed.  Mason also has a driving 
force, and that is his daughter, for which he has met once in only 30 years, 
is also in San Francisco.  Hummel wants to get the attention of the US 
Government with one final try, and get them to honor the men that he has lost 
in his covert operations.
The Rock is a shined and polished action movie directed by Michael Bay (Bad 
Boys).  The movie takes no risks in trying to be original, what Bay does is 
polish everything and make the movie shine.  The actions consist of 
fistfights, car chases, guns fights, and people hanging from precarious 
places.  But what might sound like an increasingly boring string of action 
sequences turns out to be a roller coaster ride of action.  This is the case 
only because of the heavy camera work and heavy quick editing.  I admit the 
story is a little thin, but it is enough to create the background and push for 
all of the action.
Though the story is more or less a standard action driven type, the characters 
are not the typical characters.  Ed Harris' Hummel is not the typical 
wide-eyed crazy man who has his finger on a big red button ready to kill 
millions.  He has a conscious.  As an example, early on in the movie, before 
he takes the island hostage, he tells a class of children to get on a boat and 
off the island right away.  Cage's Goodspeed is not some 
hotshot-straight-firing tough FBI field agent.  Instead he is a self-described 
"chemical superfreak."  He is the character that goes through the most change 
through the movie.  Connery's Mason is a great character, but probably the 
weakest of the trio.  Other characters and actors that are worth mentioning 
are Vanessa Marcil, in her first big budget film, as Goodspeed's pregnant 
fiancee.  William Forsythe as Paxton a FBI agent.  And last, but not least, 
David Morse who gives a great performance as Major Tom Baxtor.
Mason and Goodspeed share most of their screen time together, often saving 
each other's life.  Their relationship on screen also makes for some funny 
scenes.  And it is with these types of scenes that make the movie stick 
together.  There is balance between action and humor.  Whenever I felt that 
the action was just about to wear me out, something humorous kicks in and I'm 
ready for more.
I only have one small complaint about The Rock.  That is the heavy camera work 
that I mentioned before.  Most of it works very well, but then there are times 
where it is just overused.  This is most evident in the car chase through the 
streets of San Francisco.  Though the sequence is the most enjoyable car chase 
sequence I've seen in a long while, it is marred by the hyper-kinetic camera 
work.
The Rock is an adrenaline rush, and should be seen no matter what.  The Rock 
is on my most watched and most loved film lists.  It is no Shakespeare, but it 
is two hours of pour entertainment.  So, go see it and get ready to be rocked.

Review for Holy Man (1998)
Much like the goods pushed on Holy Man's Good Buy Shopping Network, what
you see is not what you get with Holy Man. On TV, Holy Man is sold as a
hilarious film starring Eddie Murphy, but onscreen it is a romantic comedy
with Murphy as one of the supporting players. If you can get over the fact
that what you get is not what you were sold, Holy Man is quite an enjoyable
film.
Ricky Hayman (Jeff Goldblum) is the program director at the low-rated Good
Buy Shopping Network. The ratings and sales are so low that his boss,
McBainbridge (Robert Loggia), gives him two weeks to increase the sales. If
sales don't go up, then Hayman is out. The ultimatum is not the only thing
that McBainbridge gives Hayman; he also gives Hayman a marketing manager
Kate Newell (Kelly Preston).
Off the bat Hayman is in love with Kate. But, Kate finds nothing to like
about Hayman. Hayman is a self-centered and self-serving person. Can you
see what kind of person Hayman is going to be by the end of the film? On
their way to a meeting, Hayman's car blows a tire and they are stuck. Here
is where they meet G (Eddie Murphy). G is a man on a pilgrimage that takes
any given moment to say something spiritual. G is a smiling loveable guy,
and Kate picks up on this immediately. Hayman, though, is not as accepting.
In a freak accident, Hayman almost runs G over. Hayman, under pressure from
Kate, takes G in as a houseguest until G's all healed up. Hayman finds a
good salesperson in G and persuades G to sell for GBSN. G is a hit on GBSN
and sales increase sharply. G's mix of spirituality and good humor bring
viewers in, even though G isn't pushing the product. Can all be so good? Of
course not.
Murphy is surprisingly sedate as G. This doesn't mean that he's not funny.
Murphy steals every scene he's in. Take, for example, an early scene when G
is walking down a highway and a group of teens throws a Slurpee at G.
Instead of scolding the teens or getting angry, G thanks them for not
throwing a canned soda. Only Murphy could pull off such a line and make it
a laugh-out-loud moment. The character G has a lot of pontential that is
squandered by writer Tom Schulman.
Goldblum is serviceable as Hayman. Playing against the type of character he
played in Jurassic Park and Lost World, Goldblum was able to make me like
his character even though he was a slime ball.
Preston plays the "good girl" this time around. In Jerry Maguire, which is
the same type of story, she played the "bad girl." Preston injects much
life into the flat and boring character of Kate. She brings freshness to
the mediocre and cliched script. Preston and Murphy both hold the film up.
For a horrible performance, look for Robert Loggia. He plays his part as if
he were a cigar-chewing sergeant straight out of an old World War II film.
The script by Tom Schulman is a skimpier version of Jerry Maguire. The
story is about a guy who loses himself to the pursuit of money and
struggles to find his soul again. Preston and Murphy lift the thin script
above mediocrity.
I liked Holy Man in many ways. The primary one is that it's a feel-good
film, and I walked out of the theatre with a smile. There are small things
about the film that just make you smile, such as anything that Murphy's G
does. Then other things make you laugh out loud take, for instance, G's
disappearing-Rolex trick.
I recommend Holy Man. Catch it in the theatres or on video. You won't be
disappointed as long as you keep in mind that this is not an Eddie Murphy
comedy, but a romantic comedy. Maybe the producers of Holy Man will do a
sequel with just G, since he is the most likeable character in Holy Man.
"Your good is better and better is blessed." - G.

Review for Rush Hour (1998)
Rush Hour is a prime example of how a mediocre script is made fun by the
addition of great actors and a good director.
Jackie Chan is a guy that I like. He's an atypical action hero actor. He's
charming, funny, and he does all his own stunts. Chan just feels
personable; when he's having fun onscreen, so are we. Chris Tucker, billed
on Rush Hour movie posters as the biggest mouth of the West, truly lives up
to the billing. He is hilarious with his bug-eyes and his non-stop mouth.
A Chinese consul's daughter is kidnapped and the FBI is on the case. The
consul, though, trusts only one person, and that is Inspector Lee (Chan)
from Hong Kong. Lee is flown in to help with the investigation, but the FBI
doesn't want his help. The FBI decides to call the LAPD for some
"assistance." They get the loud and renegade Detective Carter (Tucker) whom
they promptly assign to baby sit Lee while the investigation is going on.
The script is your basic odd-couple police partner story.
Both Lee and Carter are not happy with the situation that they are in.
Carter desperately wants to be an FBI agent and sees this as a prime
opportunity lost. Lee just wants to find the daughter of the consul. And as
the mediocre script would have it, it's Carter and Lee who get all the
leads and the action, not the FBI.
Rush Hour was written by Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna. It is a serviceable
script that dips into mediocrity. The saving grace for the film is the two
actors and a director who knows how to pace the film. There are some
laughs, and there is a good mix of action and comedy in this script.
Brett Ratner (Money Talks) directs Rush Hour with a steady hand. He knows
what he's doing and it shows on screen. He never lets the action stop and
masterfully mixes in the comedy. He keeps Tucker in check also. Tucker, who
sometimes gets out of hand with his personality, is held back a bit in Rush
Hour, which is definitely a benefit for the movie. Having seen Tucker in
both Money Talks and The Fifth Element, it's good that Ratner had Tucker
restrain his outrageousness for Rush Hour.
Jackie Chan is what Rush Hour is all about, though, and we get a lot of
Chan. He and stunt coordinator Terry Leonard put together some exciting
action sequences. There are also some nail-biting fight scenes, the kind of
fight scenes that we've known to come from Chan, with excitement, fun, and
laughs all mixed together. Watch for the sequence that starts Chan off on a
double-decker bus and ends up in a taxi. This was a spectacular sequences
showing his graceful moves. There are scenes in a Jackie Chan film that
just stick with you. The one that is memorable is the scene where Chan's
character is in a pool hall.
Worth mentioning is Julia Hsu as the daughter of the consulate. She is not
only cute but her part in Rush Hour allows her to be more than just the
pawn for the bad guys to take. When they kidnap her, she puts up a hell of
a fight. Also worth mentioning is the score by Lalo Schifrin. The music
fits the movie like a glove.
Don't Miss Rush Hour. After failing to break into Hollywood with an
American made film for the longest time, Rush Hour will be Chan's big hit.
His Hong Kong to Hollywood films (Rumble in the Bronx, SuperCop, First
Strike, and Operation Condor) were good, but limiting in the audience that
they could reach. Rush Hour changes that. Rush Hour has a wide audience
appeal and it proves to be a great vehicle for Chan to make it big in
Hollywood.

Review for Shuang long hui (1992)
A review of a Jackie Chan film is something that no one really reads.  Chan
films are films in which you go, you sit, you enjoy the action, and you
leave.  There's no real story, acting, or character building.  Chan films
are all about the wow-effect of the action.  And Twin Dragons has a lot of
that wow-effect.
The story for Twin Dragons is pretty thin.  A pair of twins separated at
birth are finally reunited by accident.  One twin, named Boomer (Jackie
Chan), is a tough guy and the other, named John Ma (Jackie Chan), is a
brilliant musician/composer.  When John comes to Hong Kong to conduct one
of his pieces, he bumps into Boomer by accident.  What ensues is a whole
lot of ridiculous plot, but that's not a big deal since Chan films are
about the action and not the paper thin plots.
The action in Twin Dragons is non-stop.  From the very start to the very
last seconds Twin Dragons is packed with action.  All of it amazing and all
of it hilarious.  Chan's action is what makes him stand out from other
action movie stars - there is a sense of humour that accompanies his
action.  This humour along with Chan's natural onscreen charisma makes him
the most likeable action star in the world.  The only complaint I have with
the action here is that there are some sequences where the use of handguns
is too prevalent.  In Chan films the fans go to see Chan's incredible
dexterity and quick fists-of-fury in the fight sequences, not a John Woo
double-fisted pistol gunfight -- this is a small complaint though.  While
on the subject of John Woo who as a child aspired to become a priest, look
for Woo's cameo late in Twin Dragons as the priest performing a marriage.
As always, my reviews of Chan films are quite short, either you have
already gone to see them on your own accord or you just don't have the
motivation to go.  So, my reviews are always the motivator for those of you
in the second category to go see the latest Chan film.  Don't Miss Jackie
Chan's Twin Dragons.  It's more action and comedy than his last film Rush
Hour.  One thing to mention is that sadly missing from the end of Twin
Dragons is the familiar bloopers real.

Review for Breakdown (1997)
Breakdown is a tense, tight and lean thriller.
To summarize the story in this review would ruin the movie for those who 
haven't seen it. But, I can, carefully, tell the premise without giving away 
the film. Kurt Russell and Kathleen Quinlan play a married couple, Jeff and 
Amy Taylor. They are on a cross-country road trip in their new red Jeep Grand 
Cherokee. As Jeff is driving, out from nowhere swerves a pick-up truck and 
barely hits them. Jeff speeds up to put some distance between him and the 
pick-up truck. But at the next gas station, the guys in the pick-up truck meet 
up with Jeff. They exchange a few words and that's the end of that. At least 
that's what Jeff thinks. As he and Amy speed off from the gas station, they 
get so far and then the Jeep dies in the middle of the desert. They don't know 
what to do. And to make matters worse, the guys in the pick-up just past them, 
and are perched somewhat further up the road watching Jeff and Amy like 
vultures. That is until a good Samaritan 18-wheeler truck driver stops by and 
helps push the Jeep off to the side of the road. The 18-wheeler truck driver, 
played by J.T. Walsh, looks at the Jeep, but is unable to fix it. He then 
offers to drive Jeff and Amy to the next rest stop. Jeff wants to stay with 
the Jeep but Amy wants to go to the next stop to make a call to have a tow 
truck get the Jeep. So they split up. Jeff staying with the Jeep and Amy going 
off to the rest stop. Jeff quickly finds the problem to the Jeep and drives 
over to the rest stop to pick up Amy. But, she is not there. The owner has not 
seen her. Jeff, now frantic, drives around and spots the 18-wheeler. He forces 
the 18-wheeler to stop and questions the driver he says he doesn't know who 
Jeff is and has no idea what he is talking about. And it is here where the 
story goes full speed ahead.
There are enough twists and turns in this movie to make one's head spin. The 
collection of bad guys is more than enough. The movie takes a very basic 
approach to get the audience to follow along, and that is with the question, 
will Jeff find his wife? And it is this basic approach that gives the movie 
it's tense, tight and lean feel. Kurt Russell does a good job at portraying a 
desperate man with a strong want to find his lost wife. And worth mentioning 
is Basil Poledouris' haunting score to the film. The director and co-writer 
Jonathon Mostow does a good job at keeping the film moving and keeping our 
attention focused on Jeff's problem at hand.
Breakdown is a great thriller released in a slow season. If you have a chance 
to catch this film in the theatres, do so. If not, be sure to put this film on 
your video must-see list.

Review for Gaam yuk fung wan (1987)
My family was bored this weekend so my mom went to the local Chinese video
store and rented Ringo Lam's Prison on Fire. My mom picked the film based
on the star name attached to it, Chow-Yun Fat. We expected a shoot 'em up
film but we were pleasantly surprised with the drama that we got.
Tony Leung is an ordinary man who works with his father. He has everything
that an ordinary guy could ask for; a good family, a good job, and a
girlfriend ready to marry him. That is until one night when he
involuntarily kills a robber. He is sentenced to prison for two years.
In prison he befriends a fellow inmate (Chow-Yun Fat) who knows his way
around people and the prison system. Leung's character is an up front and
honest guy, and this gets him in trouble with the head on one of the
prison's gangs. The warden of the prison is a gang-hater and gives no help
to Leung's character, and later on the warden is also insulted by Leung in
front of his superiors he puts Leung in further danger.
Prison on Fire follows Leung's character through his hardships during his
prison term. It shows a man that is forced to learn and accept change. The
main theme of the film is loyalty. The loyalty shared between Leung's
character and Fat's character. They suffer much throughout the movie,
mostly because of Leung's characters mouth.
Prison on Fire is a well-made drama by director Ringo Lam who made his US
directorial debut with the forgettable Maximum Risk (with Van Damme). There
are some slow portions of the film, but for the most part Lam keeps a good
pace. The film is in Cantonese with English subtitles. But the transfer is
not that great and sometimes the subtitles are off the bottom of the screen
(I understand enough Cantonese and that was not a big problem, but for
English speakers, beware). I recommend this film; it is a good piece of
drama. 

Title
Review for Nick of Time (1995)
Nick of Time uses a gimmick to get the audience into the movie.  The
gimmick is that for every minute in real time is equal to every minute in
movie time.  Sounds like a bad word problem from math class, right?  But,
it's simple, the events in the movie take place in real time.
In Nick of Time Johnny Depp tries his hands at being an action star.  Depp
plays Gene Watson whose daughter is being held hostage until he can
assassinate the governor of California.  Mr. Watson has exactly 90 minutes
to do it.  And for the audience, since the movie is in real-time, these
seem to be the longest 90 minutes of our lives.
The movie spins a large conspiracy story of why the people who have
Watson's daughter want to kill the governor, but it is not truly revealed
even by the end of the movie.  Watson is brought into the conspiracy, and
spied upon, by a character played by Christopher Walken.
Does the real-time gimmick work?  No, not really.  It actually seems to go
against bringing the audience into the movie.  There are lulls in the movie
when Watson has nothing to do.  And throughout the movie there are shots of
clocks, trying to remind us of how long Watson has to assassinate the
governor, in some sort of way to build tension.  The film comes off looking
cheesy.
Depp fails at becoming an action star with this film.  Moreover he looks
more like a wimp with a gun.  I've never really liked Walken as an actor,
and Nick of Time only goes to show why I don't.  Some actors can give
over-the-top performances and get away with it because they do it so well,
Travolta would be one of those actors.  But, Walken is not.  In Nick of
Time he gives an over-the-top performance, but it falls flat and he looks
more like an amateur actor overacting.
Nick of Time is a bad action film that relies on a cheap gimmick to try to
draw the audience in.  The gimmick fails to work, and one actor who can't
fill the action hero role and one actor who overacts also weight down the
film.  Skip this film unless you want to see the failed gimmick in action.

Title
Review for Sliding Doors (1998)
Sliding Doors is an interesting film in one respect: It uses a gimmick to
explore what we all wonder about each and everyday.
What is our fate, and how coincidence can change fate? There is one movie
that I love that tackles these two issues, Red. Now, there is another,
Sliding Doors. In Sliding Doors though we actually get to see what happens
if something happens and if that something doesn't happen.
Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an advertising executive in London. One morning
she is fired for no good reason. Feeling down, she goes to take the subway
home. Here's where the movie branches into the two story lines. In story
line "A" Helen is able to barely catch the train, comes home to find her
scummy boyfriend in bed with his mistress, and runs off finding consolation
with her best female friend. In story line "B" Helen misses the train, gets
mugged, and comes home barely missing her scummy boyfriend's mistress. 
In story line A Helen meets a wonderful man, James (John Hannah), starts a
new business, and is almost able to start a new life. In story line B we
get to see Helen bumble around with her tongue-tied excuse-riddled
boyfriend. Sliding Doors alternates between the two story lines and it was
somewhat of a workout trying to keep track of which story line I was
watching. Thank goodness director/writer Peter Howitt changes Paltrow's
hairstyle after the split of the story lines.
Deep inside I liked Sliding Doors, but only half of it. I liked the story
with Helen and James. John Hannah's James is just a likeable fellow. From
the get-go James charms the audience. The story line (A) is a happy
romantic comedy - Hannah's character providing much of the comedy.
The second story (B) is not as well written and I really didn't much care
for it. Helen's boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) stumbles around trying to keep
up two relationships. The weak link here is Jeanne Tripplehorn, as Gerry's
mistress, who is painful to watch on screen. Atleast John Lynch has his
stumbling around to fall upon - and when he doesn't have that, we have
Gerry's best friend to entertain us. But, next to that, story line B is a
loser story line. It is nothing but the fluff needed to hold up the gimmick
that is the staple of this film.
I'd much rather Howitt drop story line B altogether and flesh out story
line A, where Howitt puts in contrived "tension" with James' "other woman."
As for performances, Paltrow handles the double duty very well. I enjoyed
her performance very much. She is radiant on screen and it's nice to see
her again - the last film I saw of hers was Great Expectations in which she
also gives a good performance. I look forward to see her more on screen,
her next film will be the Andrew Davis film A Perfect Murder with Michael
Douglas and Viggo Mortensen. The other lead performer in Sliding Doors,
John Hannah, steals every scene he's in. The other two major performers,
Lynch and Tripplehorn, don't fair so well.
Worth mentioning is Douglas McFerran as Gerry's best friend Russell.
McFerran is given all the comedic lines in the film and his performance is
one to look for.
Sliding Doors tries to explore the "what if" situations that come from
Paltrow's character catching and missing a train. This exploration into
fate and coincidence is used to hold up the gimmick that tries to sell the
film. The only problem is that one story line is really interesting and the
other is not. And having to try to keep track of both story lines just to
see how they end up in the same place is a lot of work. I'm not sure if was
worth the work just to see how one story line turned out, much more than to
see how the two story lines meet up. Red is a better film exploring the
issues of fate and coincidence.
Had Sliding Doors been a film just about the relationship between Helen and
James (story line A) I would have given this film a Don't Miss nod. As it
stands, as a film reliant on a gimmick that doesn't work too well, I give
it a good hearty recommendation.

Title
Review for Fathers' Day (1997)
Pairing up Robin Williams and Billy Crystal for a movie sounds too good to be 
true. These two men, alone, are hilarious, how hysterical can they get if they 
are together? In Ivan Reitman's film, Father's Day, they don't get hysterical. 
They hardly make the audience laugh. I walked into the theatre with images 
from the commercials in my mind. And in the commercials, these two are 
hysterical.
In Father's Day, two men (Williams and Crystal) are called upon by a former 
romance to find a missing kid. The spin to this is that, the kid could belong 
to either one of them. The kid has run away from home, and his mother, because 
of an argument with his "father" (played by Bruce Greenwood). He has run away 
with a group of teenagers who are groupies following a band around the 
country. After waiting for Greenwood's character to chase down the kid, the 
mother resorts to lying to both Williams and Crystal, telling them that they 
are the fathers, in order to find the kid. Crystal's character lives in L.A. 
and Williams character lives in San Francisco, so there would be no problem 
there. They would never run into each other, or so the mother thinks. 
Crystal's character is a lawyer and just happens to have a client in San 
Francisco. It is here that he meets up with Williams. Unknowingly to either of 
them, they both go hunting for the kid together. This is where the fun is 
supposed to start. But it doesn't.
Now, back to the images from the commercials. If you've seen the commercial 
and laughed out loud at some of them, you've laughed at most of what there is 
to laugh at in the movie. The clips from the commercials, strangely enough, 
work very well in the commercials. But when you do see them on the screen they 
fall flat.
Stay away from this film. It's not funny at all, and I think that the studio 
executives relied mostly on big names to draw the audience into the theatre. 
How could you resist a film from Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters) starring both 
Robin Williams and Billy Crystal? Don't fall for it. Save your money, and 
maybe catch this one on video.

Title
Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
"Is it better than Antz?" is an obvious question that will come to mind
with the release of A Bug's Life. For me the answer is easy.
Unlike Antz, which was released just a few months ago, A Bug's Life is
aimed at a larger audience - though, especially aimed at kids. A Bug's Life
has less of Antz's social-political issues and replaces them with cuteness.
Antz was a movie about an ant who was a rebel in the colony; the same is
true with A Bug's Life. That's where the similarities end.
Flik (Dave Foley of "News Radio") is a rebel in the ant colony. He has many
brilliant ideas that are cast aside by the colony - including a machine
that would help ease the harvest. The harvest is a grueling ordeal for the
colony because they have to do it twice a year. Once to feed the invading
grasshoppers led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey) and another time to feed the
colony. This year Flik accidentally knocks over the pile of grain for the
grasshoppers and all is lost. Hopper arrives and gives the Queen (Phyllis
Diller) one more chance to get the harvest done. Princess Atta (Julia
Louis-Dreyfus) and a council decide to send Flik off under the pretenses of
finding warrior bugs to help battle off the returning grasshoppers.
What Flik finds is a rag-tag group of circus performers who he mistakes as
warrior bugs . These performers include: a stick-like bug, Slim (David Hyde
Pierce of "Frasier"); an overly large caterpiller of sorts, Heimlich (Joe
Ramft); a black widow spider, Rosie (Bonnie Hunt); and my favourite of them
all, a lady bug named Francis (Dennis Leary). Together these circus
performers band together with the ant colony and plan to fend off the
returning grasshoppers.
The story for A Bug's Life is simple, as it should be, to keep kids'
attention. There are many jokes that appeal to the kids, but there are also
jokes that appeal to adults taking their children to see the film. Pixar
has put out a film that will entertain all ages.
This is Pixar's second venture into making a full length computer animated
feature film. Their first was the mega-hit Toy Story. A Bug's Life has one
thing missing that Toy Story, and all other Disney films, have. The missing
element is songs during the film. For A Bug's Life it was a good choice;
the flow of the story was never interrupted by singing characters. It does
feel funny to see an animated Disney film without songs, but it's also a
refreshing change.
All the voice performers were excellent. I loved Kevin Spacey as Hopper the
most. Hopper has four arms and with the animation used to express the
personality of Hopper, he is one of the best animated character's I've seen
in a long while. Spacey has enough resonance in his voice to make Hopper
scary, but not too scary. Kudos to Spacey for a wonderful performance.
Dave Foley plays Flik and he does it with flair. Unlike the soft-spoken and
self-deprecating Woody Allen as Z in Antz, Foley is alive with the
character Flik. Flik is a character that requires a naďve and young
sounding voice and Foley provides just that.
The voice that was hilarious and will be overlooked is that of Richard Kind
("Spin City") who plays Molt, Hopper's goofy brother. Kind, who is
extremely funny in "Spin City," brings the same type of goofiness to his
character and with the brilliance of the animators at Pixar, Molt is a
grasshopper-spitting-image of Kind.
There were two semi-non-talking characters, Tuck and Roll, that are just
laugh-out-loud funny. They are the "roly-poly"  bugs and their mere
presence onscreen was enough to make me laugh.
The musical score by Randy Newman (Toy Story) fits the movie like a glove.
The score is jazzy and contemporary and goes hand in hand with the action.
As for the computer animation, Pixar has one-upped Pacific Data Images (the
people who made Antz). Antz was a film for adults and because of this the
film looked somewhat bland with all the colors taken from the real world.
This meant that there was a lot of the color brown in the film and there
wasn't really anything eye-catching about that. In A Bug's Life, directors
John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton fill the screen with bright vivid colors.
>From the sky blue of the ants to the bright red of Francis, A Bug's Life
screams with color. The one thing that that Antz had over A Bug's Life was
the sheer volume of ants rendered for film. In A Bug's Life, there are
scenes with many ants onscreen, but in Antz there are scenes with the
entire colony onscreen - and this sheer volume is overwhelming. But,
overall, A Bug's Life wins in the visual department.
A Bug's Life is the winner in the battle of the animated ants. I gave Antz
a Don't Miss nod and I'm going to give A Bug's Life a Don't Miss nod also -
I loved both films, although they are different. Whereas Antz is more deep
and exploratory look into society, A Bug's Life is quirky and hilarious. I
just enjoyed A Bug's Life more with its large audience appeal, offbeat
humor, and gorgeous look. This film is destined to be a Disney classic.
Don't Miss A Bug's Life on the big screen. And don't leave the theatre when
the credits start to roll. If you do, you'll miss out on the hilarious
bloopers reel.

Review for Meet Joe Black (1998)
Running at about three hours, Meet Joe Black is an hour too long. If you
can overlook that, the film is very enjoyable.
Death wants to take a vacation and he's picked the rich and well-to-do Bill
Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) as his guide to the living. Death takes a body
from a New Yorker (Brad Pitt) and comes to visit Bill just a few days
before Bill's 65th birthday. Bill finds out that he's scheduled to be taken
by Death. But, Death offers to postpone Bill's demise for a few days,
hours, and minutes if Bill shows Death, who's now known as Joe Black,
around. You see, Joe is bored with his job and he wants to see what it is
to be alive.
Bill's cherished daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), starts to fall in love
with the mysterious Joe. This is much to the dismay of Susan's father and
her current beau Drew (Jake Weber). Drew works closely with Bill - Drew is
second in command of Bill's company.
Meet Joe Black follows three story lines. The first is the love affair
between Susan and Joe. This story works, but not as well as it could have.
Forlani and Pitt have no screen chemistry whatsoever. Of course, how could
they? Pitt is supposed to be a dead guy. The second, which takes up a lot
of the screen time, is that of Bill being overthrown as the head of his own
broadcasting company. And the third, and most interesting, is the story
that follows between Bill and Joe, showing the relationship these two build.
As far as acting goes, Hopkins, as always, is superb. His Bill Parrish
reminded me of the character he played in The Edge -- smart and likeable.
Pitt tries something new and succeeds. At first, Pitt plays a live guy --
before Death takes over his body, and this part is like all other parts
Pitt has played. Pitt plays the suave guy who picks up women with a wink of
the eye. When Death takes over the body of Pitt's character is when Pitt
really does something fun. Pitt plays Joe energetically and most of the
time he is hilarious. His movements
are toned down and stiff.
Forlani, who I last saw in The Rock, is wonderful. She has a very
expressive face and I'd love to see her in more movies. She was a delight
to watch on screen.
Worth mentioning is the score by Thomas Newton; it is one of the best I've
heard this year. Yes, it is a bit overwrought for the film, and at times
distracting, but it just sounds good. Listen to it when you see Meet Joe
Black.
Also worth mentioning is the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (A Walk in
the Clouds). Meet Joe Black is the prettiest picture of the year.
Martin Brest impressed me as a director with his film Midnight Run. His
style is to concentrate on characters and I wanted to see if this carried
onto Meet Joe Black. He's done well, though he could have sat down with
editors Joe Hutshing and Michael Tronick to shave off 45 minutes from the
film and done better. Another suggestion for Brest is to have the actors
read their lines more quickly. This sounds like a ridiculous suggestion,
but it's quite relevant for Meet Joe Black. The actors often pause for long
periods between lines - which is at first jarring, and second, makes for
the long movie that Meet Joe Black is.
Overall, Meet Joe Black is an enjoyable film that is worth the three hours
it takes to unfold its story. If you could sit through Titanic, Meet Joe
Black shouldn't be a problem. See Meet Joe Black for the performances of
the three leads: Hopkins, Pitt, and Forlani. Also, see it to hear the score
by Newton and to see the cinematography by Lubezki. Don't Miss Meet Joe
Black on the big screen.

Review for Picture Perfect (1997)
Is Picture Perfect a good date film? No. But, it does redeem itself in some
ways.
Jennifer Aniston ("Friends") is Kate Mosley. Kate is an unmarried woman,
with all kinds of bad luck with men. Kate wants to get promoted in her
company, but her boss tells her that he wants a woman that is married and
that has something to tie her to the company (mostly big bills.) Kate's
best friend, and co-worker, shows Kate's boss a picture that Kate took at a
wedding. The picture is of Kate and a photographer, Nick, (Jay Mohr, from
Jerry Maguire.) Kate's best friend "sells" Kate, and wins Kate a promotion.
Instead of going straight to the boss and being honest about it, Kate plays
along for two reasons: 1) to keep the promotion and 2) to win the heart of
some jerk (Kevin Bacon, who is looking a bit old for the part.) This is the
silly plot that Picture Perfect uses. And at times, if you can forget about
how silly the plot is, the movie is actually pretty funny. Aniston has good
comic timing, and it shows in Picture Perfect.  The film is somewhat
confusing up until the end there is never a real feeling to who Kate really
wants, Nick or the jerk. 
I'm not sure who the costume designer was, or if there even was one, but
the outfits that Aniston wears during the film are horrible. And I'm not
the type to talk about outfits either, but these dresses were completely
awful. The one that was worst, I'm not sure if it was intentional or not,
is the green one that she wears to the first dinner party after her
promotion. The next one, that destroys her figure is the brown one that she
wears to the wedding where she meets Nick.
Next to the silliness of the premise and the bad costumes, Picture Perfect
is a mediocre film, that could have been shorter. The whole movie has a
sitcom feel to it, and that's a hard thing to shake off, especially if your
star is widely recognized as a sitcom actress. If you have time, catch
Picture Perfect on video, but it's a definite skip for seeing in the theatres.

Review for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
I'm of two minds when it comes to 2001.  Today was the first time I've seen
this classic film.  What do I think?  Two things come to mind, first, this
film was well beyond its time, technically, and is more a metaphor or poem
than a story.  Second, this film is overly long and could have been
tightened up.
2001 is a brilliant film by all technical means.  Stanley Kubrick and
Arthur C. Clark put together a film about space that was and still is very
plausible.  Unlike the other space classic, Star Wars, there are no laser
blasters, bug-eyed aliens, or gravitational field generators in 2001.  All
of the technology of 2001 reflects what was current then, and could well
possibly be current now.  An example would be the gravity on a space
station instead of putting a gravitational field generator in (the easy
way), the design of the space station is in the form of double wheels that
rotate in space, and using the centrifugal force, it is able to create
gravity for those onboard the station.  It is details like this that make
2001 a brilliant film by technical means, at no point during the film will
you not believe that what is being done could possibly be some time in the
near future.
The film is a bit overly long and could have been tightened up.  Though I
can see that the film is more of a metaphor for the future, it is somewhat
sloppy to let some scenes run as long as they do.  The opening sequence
shows this off very well.  Though it is an interesting opening to a film,
it did not have to be thirty minutes in length to show what it did.
2001 is broken into three very distinct movements.  The middle movement is
the longest, and sets up for the most memorable and known character, HAL.
This is a bit strange because the one character that is most memorable is
not human.  HAL is the famous machine that all of us know, and many movies
have mentioned (take for instance Independence Day).  The one real hero of
the film would be Dave Bowman, but he is not as memorable as HAL.
The special effects in 2001 are amazing, even when looked at with today's
advancements in special effects.  And most likely it is these special
effects that keep the film interesting.  Also interesting is the use of
classical music in the film.  Like most people I loved the use of the Blue
Danube Waltz to set up the docking of the space shuttle and the space
station.  All other classical music is well picked and well used throughout
the film.
2001 is a brilliant film ahead of its time, but it is a bit sloppy when it
comes to length and pacing.  Because it is to be viewed more as a metaphor
or a reflection of how society is this is still no reason for the length
and bad pacing.  I recommend 2001:Space Odyssey because it is a classic
film that set standards for films to follow, that is technically or via
special effects.  Its realistic rendition of space and space travel are
well done.  But, many people will be bored with the film.  If you have
three hours to spare and some patience, see 2001 for its special effects.

Review for Zongsheng sihai (1990)
Once a Thief is something unexpected from John Woo. It's a light-hearted
comedy with some action to spice it up ­ this is a polar opposite of what
I've come to expect from Woo. Usually his films are full of action with
some comedy to spice it up. Once a Thief is a nice surprise from Woo, the
director that I admire most.
First, don't get the cheesy, though made by Woo, American re-make mixed up
with this classic Hong Kong version. Although the American re-make has some
elements of this version, it doesn't live up to what the Hong Kong version
has accomplished.
Once a Thief is about three thieves working together to steal exquisite
artwork from all around the world. They were raised as thieves by a mean
spirited and violent "father." The three thieves are Jim (Leslie Cheung),
Joe (Chow Yun-Fat), and Cherie (Cherie Chung). Jim and Joe have their eyes
on Cherie. Joe the charming womanizer seems to have Cherie's attention,
much to the dismay of the more sensitive and caring Jim. This love triangle
is only a part of the multi-layered story told by Once a Thief. The major
portion of the movie is spent on Jim, Joe, and Cherie vying for a painting
that their much-hated "father" has. They want to steal the painting, their
father wants to sell the painting, and the three thieves mysterious
godfather has something else in mind.
Here's my warning for those of you who are looking for a John Woo film in
the style of The Killer and Hard-Boiled: This film is not action filled
like those. If you're looking for action, try out Woo's other films.  If
you're looking to see what Woo can do when he's not doing action, look
here. Woo, who did comedy before striking it big with the action genre,
handles this film superbly. His sense of comedic timing is excellent.
Couple this with Chow Yun-Fat's comedic timing and hilarious onscreen
persona, and you have a film that is surprisingly watchable.
Chow, whom I'm used to seeing in more serious roles (Hard-Boiled, The
Corrupter), shows that he's not just a dramatic actor. He is hilarious in
Once a Thief and has many laugh-out-loud moments in the film. Cheung and
Chung also have their moments, but none like the ones that Chow is given.
There are some standout moments in Once a Thief to look for; first and
foremost is the sequence in which Jim and Joe go into a cellar to steal the
coveted painting. This is a mix of pure action and comedy that will have
you at the edge of your seats laughing. Another moment comes late in the
film when Chow Yun-Fat shows off his pseudo-kung fu skills in one of the
funniest and silliest fight sequences that I've seen.
Don't Miss Once a Thief; this is a John Woo film that shows that he isn't
strictly and action director. I was able to find Once a Thief on DVD.  If
you don't have a DVD player you can still find this one on video.

Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
This is the first time that I will recommend a film in the first paragraph
of a review. Don't miss Titanic on the big screen. Forget all the politics
and events surrounding the making of the film and just go see it. Titanic
is easily the best film of 1997.
James Cameron has always been a brilliant technical director. His films
featured great special effects and were technically perfect in that
respect. Along with this Cameron has always populated his movies with
characters that bring us into the stories (unlike Roland Emmerich who
creates movies with eye popping special effects but surrounds this eye
candy with fluff). What Cameron has not done though is make a movie that is
full in the range of emotions that bring a technically good film up to a
brilliant film. With Titanic, Cameron tries to put this range of emotions
into a film and it works out very well. He shows us that he can not only
make a technically perfect film, but can also make a film that makes us
laugh, cry, and scream.
The Titanic was the ship that couldn't be sunk. It was the largest ship
built at the time that it set sail on its maiden -- and as history tells,
last -- voyage. The tragedy of it was that the builders of the ship were so
confident of the design of the ship that they only outfit the ship with
enough lifeboats to save half of the people on the ship. Some time in the
early morning of April 15, 1912, Titanic struck an iceberg and sunk in the
North Atlantic. There were 2200 people onboard the ship -- 1500 of them died.
Cameron does not hide the fact that the Titanic sinks, how could he? He
uses a good way to introduce us to the story and to get us up to speed
quickly. The movie opens in the present with some stunning footage of the
actual Titanic underwater. As we come back up to the surface we find out
that an expedition led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is trying to find the
"Heart of the Ocean". The "Heart of the Ocean" is a 56 caret diamond that
was lost with the sinking of the Titanic. When Lovett is unable to recover
it he is disappointed. What he does find is a sketch of a beautiful young
woman wearing the diamond. In a coincidence, the woman, now 101, sees the
sketch during a news broadcast. The 101 year old woman, Rose DeWitt Bukater
(Gloria Stuart), comes forth to tell the tale of what happened on the
Titanic's final voyage.
>From here on Cameron moves the film back in time and the story is told,
mainly, from young Rose's (Kate Winslet) point of view. Along with this is
the point of view of a free going gambler and artist Jack Dawson ( Leonardo
DiCaprio). And this portion of the film, almost two-thirds of the films
running time, we watch and are engrossed by the love story that is spun
between Rose and Jack on the ill-fated Titanic.
Cameron keeps the movie focused on only Jack and Rose. Rose is a rich girl
marrying Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) because of his money. She finds herself
in a precarious situation while trying to run away from the marriage. From
this situation she meets Jack, who saves her from death. The chemistry
between Jack and Rose are instantaneous and we are pulled into their story
immediately.
What is surprising with Titanic is that Cameron is able to move the focus
of the movie from the tedious disaster film that Titanic could have been to
a character and story driven story that Titanic is. And for almost two
hours we forget about the sinking of the ship and we are with Jack and Rose
following what happens to them and not worrying about the iceberg that sits
somewhere off in the horizon waiting to puncture the ship.
The first two hours or so of the film moves quickly, mainly because of the
good pacing and the great writing of Cameron. But, if you think that
Cameron lets things slow down in the third act (and third hour) you're
wrong. Cameron is actually able to pick up the pacing for the third hour
and the third hour flies along well because of this. This third hour is the
actual sinking of the ship. And this could have been all eye-candy, but
Cameron is again able to put more into this portion of the film. And for
this last hour we are constantly biting our finger nails in trying to find
out if both Jack and Rose will survive the sinking of Titanic. And this
shows how well done the film is. The sinking of the Titanic is visually
awesome, but in all of this chaos we are still focused on Jack and Rose.
As for the Titanic itself, Cameron builds an almost scale model of the ship
to shoot the film with and then sinks it. The visuals all through the film
are awesome and have to be seen to be believed. There are many "how did
they do it" special effect shots in this film. Cameron proves once again
that he can push special effects to its limits and still maintain
characters that are believable and dimensional.
DiCaprio does a good job as Jack, but the shining star of Titanic is Kate
Winslet. What sets the two lead performances apart is the range of emotion
that the two can achieve. And Winslet clearly has a larger range that
DiCaprio. She does a great job as Rose and I hope that she wins the Best
Actress Oscar for her performance in Titanic.
The supporting actors and actresses also do great jobs with their roles.
Worth mentioning is Billy Zane as the callous Cal, Bernard Hill as the
Captain of Titanic, and David Warner as Cal's bodyguard of sorts.
The running time seems long (at three plus hours) but the movie is paced
well and moves along quite quickly. This is the best film to date from
James Cameron and is the best film of 1997. The studio heads save the best
for last. Don't Miss Titanic on the big screen.

Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
Starship Troopers is one of the most anticipated winter releases this year.
 It is a movie that has a whole lot of special effects and hole worth of a
story.  The current thought running through the heads of studio executives
in Hollywood seems to be: Spend a large portion of the movie budget on
special effects, whatever is left, use it to hire some B-list actors.
Unfortunately, that is what happened with Starship Troopers, it seems that
a large portion of the movie's budget went into creating the incredible
special effects and not enough went into hiring some good actors and maybe
a good screenwriter.  I'll admit, the special effects in Starship Troopers
are spectacular.  From the swarms of bugs running across the desert to the
huge transport ships, these are top-notch special effects, eye candy to say
the least.  Very impressive.  What isn't impressive though is the script
and the actors hired for the film.
In the late future, bugs from across the galaxy attack us by slinging
asteroids at Earth.  On Earth, in Buenos Aires, a group of teens are just
graduating from high school.  All of them want to join up with the
Federation and go off to fight the bugs.  This tight group of teens include
Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer), Carmen Ibanez
(Denise Richards), and Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris, Doogie Howser).
Rico and Flores are sent off to become Mobile Infantry, the people that go
ground zero against the bugs.  Ibanez is sent off to become a pilot and
Jenkins goes off to read bug minds.
The movie is split into two halves.  The first hour is a cheezy
melodramatic rehash of most every episode of 90210 shown.  Complete with
bad dialogue, bad acting, and slow pace.  The second half is a visceral and
violent hour-long action sequence.  
The first half is plain awful.  We get to see teens fighting with their
parents, teens fighting amongst themselves, and a love triangle.  When the
teens finally get sent off to boot camp we get a gratuitous nude scene when
co-ed privates shower together.  Nothing in the first half really amounts
to anything.
The second half is a guilty pleasure for me.  It is very well done, though
it does get old quickly.  The bugs attacking are just amazing and the
interaction between the bugs and humans are seamless.  The problem that
makes it get old quickly?  Repetition.  The hour is a cycle: Humans attack,
bugs counter attack, humans retreat, start over again.  At first it is
great fun, then it goes down hill.
Paul Verhoven of Robocop, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, and Showgirls fame
seems to want to mix the genres of those four movies in Starship Troopers.
We get violence in such a dose that we become numb to it.  We get sarcastic
news broadcasts taken completely from Robocop, but do less, which try to be
wry and funny, but come off making the movie look cheap.  We get a dose of
nudity and some sex in the battlefield.  Verhoven seems to be having a
streak of bad luck with his last few films and Starship Troopers doesn't
help to bring him out of this streak either.
The script doesn't do well either.  When the second half came rolling in
and I saw how the bugs fought, the questions started to roll in my head.
Why don't the future space Marines have heavy artillery?  What happened to
tanks or helicopters?  Why not nuke the bugs?  Why send in lightly armored
soldiers when you could have so many other options that would have saved
the lives of the many troops sent in?  Easy, a sloppy script that doesn't
take into account logic.  There wouldn't be a movie if any of my
suggestions were taken into account and this could only mean one thing for
the script writer, Edward Neumeier, he'd have to use his head and write a
smart script.
The actors are all pretty bland.  Of the four main characters only one had
a performance that I enjoyed and that was Dina Meyer (Dragon Heart).  I
hope to see Meyer in more films soon.  She gives a good performance in
Starship Troopers and is the only character for which I did care for on the
screen.  Of the minor characters Michael Ironside, Jake Busey, and Clancy
Brown give good performances.  All of the other actors give mediocre to bad
performances.
One more thing, the bugs in Starship Troopers are not as scary as the
Alien.  I had talked to a friend about this earlier on, I feel that the
bugs in Starship Troopers are not as scary because they are not as smart as
they should be.  They swarm and attack with not a single thought on tactic.
 But, this seems right since the majority of the attacks are by the
"worker" bugs.  But then you look at the Alien and it is the same "worker"
alien that is hunting out the humans, stalking them and killing them
intelligently.  Yes, the bugs in Starship Troopers are scary, but in the
long run, they are just stupid bugs.  The Alien is a more thought out
creature and is, for me, a smarter and scary foe.
Turn off your brain and sit back.  The first half is pretty bad and the
second half comes close to redeeming the film.  Starship Troopers is fun at
times, but just sickening at others.  This is definitely not a film for the
kids, there are heavy doses of violence and death, then there are the sex
and the nudity scenes.  Starship Troopers is not a strong movie.  The only
thing that it has going for it are the special effects and even then that
is only the second half of the film.  I find it hard to recommend Starship
Troopers, but I will because of the action in the second half of the film.
Though, see it during a matinee showing or on video.

Review for Matrix, The (1999)
If I say too much about The Matrix I risk spoiling your fun when you see
it.  If I say too little about The Matrix I risk you losing interest in
this intriguing and thought provoking film.  So, let me say this up front
about The Matrix: Don't Miss The Matrix.  This is the best science fiction
movie put out so far this year and possibly for the rest of the year.
Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a bland software engineer by day and a daring hacker
by night.  As of late he's been getting some strange messages from an
unknown source warning him of a danger to his life.  The messages come from
a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and are sometimes delivered by a
beautiful messenger Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).  From here on, if I say
anything else I'll spoil the twists and turns that the movie goes through.
Let's just say that what you think is real, isn't.
The Matrix comes from the Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry.  These are
the same two that put together the equally brilliant film Bound.  Being
their second film, I was sure that The Matrix was going to be a solid film
but what The Matrix really is surprised me.  These two are not just
Hollywood hacks; they are two talented moviemakers.  What makes the
Wachowski brothers so good is their sense of style and atmosphere.  If
you've seen Bound then you'll know what I mean.  With The Matrix they turn
the style and atmosphere up a notch.  The film is dark, gritty, and dense.
Shadows and light are used to the extreme, with shadows lingering and light
casting in all sorts of mysterious ways.  Actors are lit in ways that
attract the eye from one section of the screen to the other, while at other
times actors are half hidden in the shadows.  The Matrix is more than just
a solid film; it is an instant classic.
What makes The Matrix so intriguing is the way that the Wachowski brothers
tell the story.  Instead of laying the whole story on us at once, they
layer it on.  Using Neo as the freshman, we learn at his rate as he is
taught about The Matrix.  This slow layering of the story works well and
helped to keep my attention focused on the story presented.  It was only
until after the film ended that a big question popped into my mind, but
we'll get that later.
The Matrix is a mix of Dark City and Strange World with some Gibson stirred
in for good luck.  The ideas presented are horrifyingly plausible and
strangely engaging.  Keep this in mind; the film is not a brain-dead film.
The script is quite intelligent and though it'll be hard for you to lose
interest in the film, you'll want to keep the brain turned on for this
sci-fi action film.  The film doesn't stay with one genre too long, it
defies cliches and moves between genres at will and does this well.
There's quite a bit of action, some romance, a double cross, and a lot of
sci-fi.  The portion of the film, next to the sci-fi, that got a large
chunk of my attention was the action.
Most often American directors who try to emulate my favourite director John
Woo end up looking like cheap knock-offs.  But, this is the first time that
I've ever seen action done at a level that approaches Woo.  The Wachowski
brothers are, in my book, close or as good as Woo in doing action.  The
action sequences in The Matrix are of the same type of adrenaline pumping,
at-the-edge-of-your-seat action that Woo puts together.  There are many
standout sequences, including some incredibly choreographed hand-to-hand
sequences that will not be forgotten anytime soon.  The action sequences
that had me in awe were the gun-fighting sequences.  Sure, we've all seen
it done before; the slow-mo, and the bad guys that have no aim, the bullet
shells hitting the floor.  But, it's never been done this well.
The special effects by Matthew Ferro are a visual feast.  Bullets can speed
up, slow down, and can also come to screeching halts.  People can run up
walls, jump into the air and linger, and then come crashing down with
enough force to crack pavement.  Then there are the subtle effects that are
added for style.  Look at the way that Ferro and the Wachowski brothers use
reflections in Morpheus's sunglasses.  These are some of the best effects
to ever hit the screen.
Performance wise, all performers give good performances.  Actually, I think
that the secret with the Wachowski brothers is that they do not tailor the
performances of the actors to the movie, but instead tailor the movie and
atmosphere to the actors.  Keanu Reeves, whom when not pressured to emote
too much, can turn in good performances.  He did just that in Speed and
Devil's Advocate; and he does it again in The Matrix.  Laurence Fishburne's
last foray into sci-fi was the horrible Event Horizon; this time around he
does much better.  Not only does he have better material to work with, but
he also has a part that is tailored to his acting style.  Fishburne is just
right for the part of Morpheus.  Carrie-Anne Moss, whom I've never seen as
a performer, puts in a wonderful performance as Trinity.  But, the
performer to notice is Hugo Weaving who is one of the Sentinel Agents
(imagine an evil version of the Men In Black).  Weaving uses a monotonous
flat performance that turns out to be one of the best in the film.
The thing that got to me after I stepped out of the theatre was the fact
that the film ends a bit too abruptly.  It leaves a question that I
couldn't figure out the answer to and that I thought could have been
answered in the film.  I'll reveal the question and I'll do it in such a
way not to spoil any fun: What are the freed people going to do in the
world that they're freed into?  This question is a nagging question that
the film glosses over with a voice-over that really doesn't tie things up
as tightly as could be.  But, this is only a small nuisance of the film.
Looking at the film as a whole, it is a well put together and entertaining
film.
Let me just reiterate: Don't Miss The Matrix.  This is one of the best
films of the year.  Please do catch this on the big screen, there are some
effects that are meant to be seen on the big screen.  You'll have to see
the film to find out the answer to the big question:

Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
If you're a Trekkie, serious or casual, you'll most likely know about the
curse of the odd-numbered Star Trek films. But, for those of you who don't,
here's a quick rundown of the movies. Number one was overly long. Number
two is the best of the films featuring the original crew. Number three, was
there a number three? Number four was a light-hearted and fun adventure.
Number five, well, what can I say? William Shatner directed it. Number six
was exciting. Number seven suffered because of Kirk and a mediocre story.
Number eight, First Contact, is the best of the series - there's no beating
the Borg as an enemy. Now, we have number nine - will it suffer the wrath
of the odd-number?
Unlike First Contact, Insurrection is more light-hearted. The film reminded
me a lot of The Voyage Home (IV) because it doesn't take itself too
seriously. There are quite a few laughs in this film; I would say a few too
many. This veers the film from light-hearted to campy.
Insurrection opens with Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) on a field study
of the Ba'ku, a Luddite-like culture. Data goes berserk and takes hostages.
The Enterprise is called to come get Data before he is put out of
commission. When the Enterprise arrives, a series of events thickens the
plot. We find out that the Federation has made new partners with the Son'a
and are studying the Ba'ku. The Son'a have ulterior motives for the study,
though.
It seems that the planet the Ba'ku inhabit is surrounded by rings of a
substance that continuously regenerates the cells of living organisms. This
substance is of interest to the leader of the Son'a, Ru'afo (F. Murray
Abraham), and is seen by Admiral Dougherty (Anthony Zerbe) as a saviour for
the Federation. What could be better than the eternal life provided by the
rings of the Ba'ku planet?
What Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) finds is a ring of conspiracy within
the Son'a/Federation partnership. He finds that the partnership is in
violation of the Prime Directive (the Federation cannot interfere with
technologically limited civilizations).
The main theme of Insurrection is so obvious that unless you're brain dead,
it'll hit you like a two-by-four between the eyes. It's obvious from the
first twenty minutes that the writers are drawing parallels to the
Europeans invading North America and ridding the land of the Native Americans.
One fun thing about going to a Star Trek film on opening night is the
atmosphere of the crowd. The Star Trek crowd is different than all others.
There is a loose Trekkie bond between people who don't know each other.
While waiting, my friend Aaron and I talked to some beer-drinking Trekkies
about different cameos in the different films (Christian Slater, Kirstie
Alley, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd) and in front of us was a guy
dressed as Riker. There's nothing like going to a Star Trek film on opening
night.
As for the film itself, I thought it was a bit too campy. It was an
entertaining film, but there were a few flaws. First, and foremost, there
was too much comedy in the film. I like to laugh, but Insurrection felt
more like a comedy than a Star Trek film. From Worf's puberty to Riker and
Troi running around like horny teenagers, this film just felt weird.
Second, the special effects were awful - a full step behind those of First
Contact. The new Enterprise looked like a cheezy model bought from a
discount store - as did most of the ships in the film. I'm not sure if the
production ran out of money for special effects or what, but they were not
up to par with those presented in First Contact. And last, the plot felt
like an overly long version of a TV episode.
The two good things about the film were director Jonathon Frakes and music
composer Jerry Goldsmith. Frakes is able to keep the film moving at a brisk
pace and Goldsmith is able to integrate the score into the film seamlessly.
Goldsmith is one of the hardest working composers in Hollywood and I'm
always delighted to hear his work.
The best performer in the film is Stewart. As always Stewart is a joy to
see onscreen because he never fails to entertain. Kudos to Stewart for a
great performance in Insurrection. Also kudos to Brent Spiner for another
funny performance as Lt. Commander Data. Spiner gets some of the best
moments of the film and he juices each and every one of them for its full
entertainment value. F. Murray Abraham's Ru'afo is one of the less
memorable bad guys in the Star Trek series. He doesn't even come close to
Ricardo Montalban as Kahn in The Wrath of Khan.
All in all, Insurrection is not a bad film, but it still does suffer a
little from the curse of being an odd-numbered film. I was fairly
entertained by the end of the film, but not as much as I was after seeing
First Contact. Though, I admit it is a hard task to follow up a brilliant
film like First Contact. Catch Insurrection at matinee or on video.

Review for Most Wanted (1997)
Keenen Ivory Wayans is a man of many talents.  He is known mostly for his
comedic talents though, remember In Living Color?  With Most Wanted Wayans
tries his hands at writing an action film and at becoming an action hero.
After seeing Most Wanted I would suggest that Wayans stick with what he
does best, and that is comedy.
Most Wanted follows Sgt. James Dunn (Wayans).  Dunn, a Marine, was
imprisoned because he killed his superior.  A covert operations group led
by General Adam Woodward (Jon Voight) takes Dunn from prison and he is
enlisted as part of an operation to kill a prominent businessman.  The
First Lady is killed instead and it seems that Dunn is the patsy for this
operation.  The only evidence that can save Dunn is a video taken by a Dr.
Victoria Constantini (Jillian Hennessy).  Dunn finds Constantini, through a
rather ludicrous way, and together they run from the conspiracy that worked
to kill the First Lady.
As the film goes on and Dunn continues to escape the grips of both
authorities and the conspiracy the more ludicrous the movie becomes.  The
problem with Most Wanted is that it tries to build a large conspiracy
behind what happened to the First Lady.  If built right it could have been
a very interesting addition to the film.  As it stands the story behind the
conspiracy is better left untold.  Along with the ludicrous story line come
really bad lines.  The script is definitely not the strong point of the
film, but in Most Wanted just about everything is not the strong point of
the film.
My suggestion for the filmmakers would have been less exposition and more
action.  When a script as unbelievable as this needs lots of action to keep
the audience from stopping to think about how unbelievable the script is.
The filmmakers of Most Wanted didn't do this and the lulls between action
sequences leave a lot of time for the audience to regain their disbelief.
Most Wanted is a ludicrously bad film all around.  The action sequences are
mediocre but not worth the movie ticket price, even during matinee.  Most
Wanted is definitely a movie to skip.

Title
Review for Amistad (1997)
James Berardinelli pointed it out best, Spielberg's Schindler's List is to
Jurassic Park what Amistad is to Lost World. I hope that this is a short
cycle for Spielberg, because the first cycle was a lot stronger than this
second one. Jurassic Park was a lot more fun than Lost World, and
Schindler's List is a lot stronger than Amistad. If this is a cycle for
Spielberg it looks as if the cycle is getting weaker.
This is not to say that Amistad is not a great movie, it's just not as
great as Schindler's List. Amistad is a good movie that stands not on its
plot and story but on the performances of its leads; Djimon Hounsou,
Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, and to a lesser extend Morgan Freeman.
Spielberg opens the film with a harrowing sequence on how slaves take over
the ship that they are being shipped on, La Amistad. The sequence is very
graphic and shows clearly the feelings of the slaves towards those who have
taken them slave. After this the slaves try to sail the ship back to their
home country with the help of the captain. They though end up in
Connecticut where groups of different people, with different agendas, argue
about the "ownership" of these slaves. This includes the Prime Minister
from Spain representing the prepubescent Queen -- in which Spielberg
handles with some good humour and irony. But the real fight is between the
Attorney General of the United States and a small time properties lawyer
Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey). The Attorney General is fighting on "behalf"
of the United States and Spain. The current President at the time wants to
avert a civil war from this situation and in doing so also make Spain
happy. Baldwin wants to set the slaves free after he befriends one of them,
Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) the leader of the group.
Anthony Hopkins, starring as former President John Quincy Adams, has a
small introduction in the beginning and then is forgotten for almost half
the film. I wish that it wasn't so, but I guess you can't change history.
Hopkins is just wonderful as the former President, injecting into the
character a large dose of humour.
Newcomer, Djimon Hounsou, gives a great performance as the leader of the
slaves, Cinque. His strong stubborn performance is one that is inspiring.
You latch on to his cause and that is what really carries the film.
McConaughey, whom we last saw in this summer's Contact, gives a good
performance as the lawyer who wants to free the slaves, Baldwin. And Morgan
Freeman is given a somewhat smaller part as Theodore Joadson an
abolitionist who first brings up the case of the slaves to Baldwin. Freeman
who is always a strong screen presence does well, though he is not given
enough screen time. The star of the film is Hopkins though, his performance
is the staple of the film.
Spielberg makes a good film with Amistad, but it doesn't top Schindler's
List. I found that there was no real antagonist in Amistad, the only real
antagonist is the idea of slavery. The mid-portion of this film where
Cinque recounts how he had been brought into slavery is again like the
opening sequence. This sequence is disturbingly frank and the audience is
forced to sit through the sequence because as the audience knows, it's all
too true.
Spielberg is able to bring an emotional closing to the film through
Hopkins' speech. And again, I stress, Hopkins' performance in Amistad is
the one that holds the film together. This performance is Oscar material,
and I hope that he gets honoured for it. What I did like was that Spielberg
was able to insert different pieces of humour throughout the film to let
out some tension and to stir things up again. This was a good move from
Spielberg for such a long film.
Worth mentioning is John Williams' score for the film, which like all his
scores is brilliant.
Amistad is not a great film, but it is a good film that is worth watching
on the big screen. It is a good return for Spielberg after his special
effects driven and plot less dinosaur romp Lost World. It's also the first
film directed by Spielberg out of the DreamWorks SKG production house and
it is a good release at that. Don't miss Amistad on the big screen.

Title
Review for Wing Commander (1999)
The guy who left the (near empty) theatre ahead of me described Wing
Commander in the simplest of all manners, `Boy, did that suck.'  I try not
to write reviews that use the word `suck' because it's not too
`professional,' but, in this case, I have to: Boy, did this movie suck.
Being in my early to mid-twenties, I have the fortune of playing all five
of the Wing Commander games.  So, I was looking forward to this movie.  The
movie is directed by Wing Commander game creator Chris Roberts and the
script is based on his story.  The problem is that Roberts has never done a
major motion picture before.  The difference between shooting the
cut-scenes between shoot em up segments in a game and shooting a major
motion picture is tremendous.  And lets just say that with the movie Wing
Commander the exciting shoot em up portion of the series is dearly missed.
 Without the shoot em up portions of the game we're left with a
meandering, uninspired, and boring movie that leeches from ever sci-fi film
known to man.
The film focuses on the main character of the game, Christopher (Freddie
Prinze Jr.) Blair, who is some sort of hybrid human that can navigate
through space using his gift (can you say `The Force?')  There is an evil
race of cat-like beings headed straight for Earth to annihilate the human
race and the only people who can save Earth are onboard the Tiger Claw, a
space carrier that Blair is assigned to.  That's the whole story of the
film.  Fill in the amazingly large gaps of time with sub-standard dialogue,
boring one-dimensional characters, cliched love stories, and
video-game-like space dogfights and you have two hours of pure space-hell.
The script by Kevin Droney is absolutely horrible and should've been
ejected into deep space long before it got green lighted to be shot.
Roberts who showed that he knew a little about how to direct a small screen
film does what he can with the script.  Though, his directing skills still
need a bit of work, especially in coercing good performances out of the
cast.  The whole cast gives bland performances.  And who can blame them
given the material they're working with.  I guess everyone needs a paycheck
between good films.
There were lots of holes in the film that stuck out, but there are two that
I want to point out.  When attacked, both the humans and the Kilrathi seem
to forget that they're in deep space where things can move on three axes.
When the carriers are torpedoed, the captains of the respective ships yell,
`Hard to port!'  Hey, captains, how about `Pull up and hard to port!' or
`Dive and hard to port!'  The second thing are the weapons.  It's so many
hundred of years in the future, man has flown to the deepest portions of
space, and these ships are still shooting machine guns with bullets?  Where
are the energy weapons?  Where are the lasers?
Sometimes with special effects driven movies, like Wing Commander, I can at
least recommend renting the film on video to see the special effects.
Godzilla is an example one of these types of films, horrible script, but
pretty good special effects.  It's too bad that Wing Commander is not only
deficient in the story arena but also in the special effects arena.
Originally slated for release straight-to-video, Wing Commander might have
been enjoyable as a rental, but on the big screen?  It's a waste of money.
I'm sorry I shelled out money and spent time sitting through this movie.
Creator/Director Chris Roberts makes a cameo appearance late in the film as
a search and rescue pilot; it's too bad there's nothing Roberts could have
done to rescue this piece of space debris.  Skip, skip, skip Wing Commander.

Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME (1999)
After 95 minutes of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, I was sure that
there was only 30 minutes of real comedy in this film.  The other 65
minutes is awfully unfunny filler material.  I admit I'm have a soft spot
for dumb-comedies, much like There's Something About Mary, but when the
makers of a dumb-comedy run out of comedy it's just dumb.
 he Spy Who Shagged Me starts off where Austin Powers: International Man of
Mystery finishes.  Austin (Mike Myers) Powers is faced with a surprise
attack by a familiar carry over character from the original film.  After
the attack he discovers that he's lost his `mojo'.  As it turns out, Dr.
Evil (Mike Myers) has created a time machine and has traveled back in time.
 And it is in the past that Dr. Evil has stolen Austin Power's mojo.  Dr.
Evil has a small sidekick this time around too, Mini-Me (Verne Troyer) who
is an exact duplicate of Dr. Evil only smaller.  A subplot involves Dr.
Evil's son who feels neglected by his father because his father is giving
more attention to Mini-Me.  Austin must recover his mojo, so he travels
back in time too.  When he arrives in the past, CIA agent Felicity (Heather
Graham) Shagwell joins him.  Together they set out to spoil Dr. Evil's
plans of world domination and to recover Austin's mojo.
My major complaint with this Austin Powers film is that it is purely
unfunny material punctuated by some intensely funny moments.  The film also
tries to get some laughs with crude jokes like the ones found in There's
Something About Mary, but for the most part these jokes fail in Austin
Powers.  The script by Mike Myers and Michael McCullers is bland, unfunny,
and way too long.  The direction by Jay Roach doesn't help either, his
pacing of the film is horrible, leaving me to look at my watch many times
during the showing wondering when the next laugh is or when the end is.
Myers plays a few of the characters in the film and does fine with most of
them.  He's nothing special on screen.  Heather Graham does what she can
with the Barbie Doll-like character she's given.  Her part requires nothing
but for her to prance around with a gun and costumes designed to show as
much cleavage as possible -- telling you just who the target audience of
this film is.  I enjoyed Graham's performances in other films, such as
Boogie Nights and even Lost in Space, but this film is just a terrible
waste of her talents.  The best thing about this film, and this is a hard
find in such an intolerable film, is Mini-Me.  This character is one the
funniest parts of the film and I enjoyed it.
One issue that bothered me with this film is the MPAA rating of the film as
a PG-13 film.  With the heavy sexual innuendo, some of it quite blatant
(like the rocket ship that Dr. Evil travels in), this film should have been
rated R.  But, I'm guessing that the producers of the film pulled some
strings to get a PG-13 rating so that the film could open to the target age
group: young impressionable boys who would understand some of the moronic
comedy in this film.  Still, this film shows just how MPAA ratings don't
fit some films.  If you're a parent and you have younger children wanting
to see this film, don't let them, this film is not appropriate for them.
No matter, this film invokes either a love or hate relationship with the
audience, I'm in the latter group.  A moronic film that is 30 minutes of
comedy and 65 minutes of filler material, this film is an abysmal entry
into the summer movie lineup.  Even if you're old enough to see this film,
Skip, Skip, Skip it.  Skip it in the theatres at full price, Skip it in the
theatres at matinee, and Skip it on video.  Austin Powers is shagless. 

Title
Review for Ronin (1998)
In Japanese legend, a ronin was a samurai whose lord was killed. Left with
no one to protect and ashamed that he let his master die, a ronin wandered
the countryside often as a killer for hire, or a thief. In John
Frankenheimer's Ronin, we meet a band of modern-day ronins.
In a small café in Paris we meet these ronins Sam the American (Robert De
Niro) who to our knowledge is ex-CIA, or at least he says he is; Vincent
(Jean Reno) from France who is the team's "tour guide"; computer expert
Gregor (Stellan Skarsgard) from Russia; from England, weapons expert Spence
(Sean Bean); and master driver Larry (Skipp Sudduth) from America.
Deidre (Natascha McElhone), who is under the control of a mysterious man,
has brought this international team of "ronins" together. Deidre is told to
get together this team in order to steal a suitcase. What's in the
suitcase? We don't know. The suitcase is just a McGuffin - or as Alfred
Hitchcock, the man who coined this term, defines as an object that we are
all focused on, but it really doesn't matter what it is.
For the rest of the movie we follow this team of ronins on their quest to
get back the suitcase. We go from shootouts to car chases to shoot outs and
back to car chases. If this sounds tedious to you, it is not. I'm sure this
repetition would have failed under the hands of a beginner and untalented
director, but under the steady hands of John Frankenheimer, it works out
really well.
I lost count of shootouts but there were three spectacular chases. Some
might argue that three chases in one movie is two too many. But, these car
chases are technically brilliant - the logistics of putting three of them
together must have been a nightmare. From the tight and fast driving in the
claustrophobic and anemic streets of Paris to the weaving and avoiding
oncoming traffic, these car chases are the staples for Ronin.
The shootouts get the adrenaline pumping with the zings and whizzes of
bullets flying all around. There's nothing like watching Robert De Niro
wielding an M-60 and taking out faceless bad guys in a tight alleyway. The
sound design for this movie is fully enveloping. For example, there is a
scene where one of the ronins is being beat up in a backroom. As the camera
pans to another character, we hear the punches and grunts swirl around to
the right rear. I turned my head backward to see if it was an audience
member grunting or if it was a sound effect. Kudos to the sound design team.
Writers J.D. Zeik and Richard Weisz (pseudonym for David Mamet) put
together a script that keeps us wondering who can and can't be trusted. The
plot for Ronin is not strong - a bunch of guys look for a suitcase - but it
is enough for Frankenheimer to wrap his action around. 
It's hard not to compare Ronin with Mission: Impossible. Both Ronin and
Mission: Impossible are about a band of spies who have lost their jobs and
are out to steal something. Where Mission: Impossible failed is in the
action and plot. Mission: Impossible's plot was too tangled to enjoy and
the action was thin at best. Had Mission: Impossible, like Ronin, had a
strong script and director behind it, it would have turned out to be a much
better movie.
The actors in Ronin give stand-out performances. How could they not? These
are top-notch actors. Robert De Niro gives an outstanding performance as
Sam. His portrayal of Sam is as an overly cautious man who is willing to
take calculated risks. In one scene, De Niro gives the perfect bite to a
line. After talking another ronin into taking a bullet out of himself, De
Niro calmly says, "You think you can stitch me up on your own? If you don't
mind, I'm going to pass out."
Jean Reno is a great actor who is sometimes squandered - look at how his
talents are wasted in Mission: Impossible and Godzilla. When given the
chance to perform, Reno shines. His character of Vincent is a tough
Frenchman who is loyal to the people that he can trust. Reno gives an
outstanding performance as Vincent.
Bean, Skarsgard, and McElhone all give good performances. Skarsgard, who
was the caring teacher in Good Will Hunting, is vicious in Ronin. It was
funny to see German ice skater Katerina Witt in Ronin as a Russian ice skater.
I haven't seen any of John Frankenheimer's (The Manchurian Candidate) films
other than Ronin. After seeing Ronin, I will be renting Frankenheimer's
older works to see more of his style. Frankenheimer definitely has a style,
gritty and realistic. He also has a mastery of putting together
edge-of-your-seat moments. Something to note Frankenheimer recently won an
Emmy for directing the cable TV movie George Wallace.
Worth mentioning is Elia Cmiral's score for Ronin that builds a lot of
tension during the film.
Ronin is a white-knuckle thriller. It kept me at the edge of my seat for
the full running time and had me flinching during the action sequences. The
plot for Ronin is much like the suitcase, it's something that we care
about, but don't know anything about. It would have been nice to have a
little more plot - but, with a talented director behind the script we
forget about the paper-thin plot. Don't Miss Ronin. Ronin makes some of the
action movies of the summer look like dramas.

Title
Review for Spawn (1997)
Spawn aims to be a dark, broad, and moody comic book to silver screen
translation, much like the first two Batman films and the first Crow film.
It almost reaches this difficult goal, but falls short when a specific
character is introduced and the story starts to lag.
Spawn is about Al Simmons (Michael Jai White), an agent for some
super-secret government operation, A-6.  A-6 is a group that conducts
operations that most of us Americans don't know about.  Simmons, though, is
through with running these black-ops.  He has grown a conscience and wants
out of A-6.  Which is fine with his superior, Jason Wynn (Martin Sheen).
Simmons, as it seems, is the best killer around, and the forces of evil,
lead by the Devil himself, want Simmons to lead the army of evil.  The
middleman between the Devil and these mortals on Earth is an evil clown
(the unrecognizable John Leguizamo).  Simmons is killed in "one last
operation" and his soul is sent to Hell.  In Hell, Simmons makes a deal
with the Devil.  In order to see his wife, Wanda, again, Simmons agrees to
lead the army of evil.  But, as Simmons returns to Earth as Spawn, a hero
with a suit that morphs (complete with chains and a cool cape), his
conscience returns also.  With the devil's helper, the clown, sitting on
one shoulder and a new godly helper, Coglistro (Nicol Williamson), sitting
on the other, Spawn fights himself to see if he is evil or good.  There is
a subplot about a genocidal chemical that Wynn wants to unleash onto the
world, but that subplot falls to the wayside of the special effects.
What ruins the film is Leguizamo as the clown.  First time director Mark
Dippe (known mainly for his special effects work at ILM) does a great job
with visuals and setting the mood of the film, that is until the arrival of
Leguizamo.  Leguizamo fills his time on screen with bad one liners and
flatulence jokes.  You can see how this instantly toasts the dark mood.
As with most comic book to silver screen translations the story in Spawn is
pretty thin and the characters two-dimensional.  At the time that the Spawn
comic books were released, I was still a comic book reader.  In the comic
book Spawn, Simmons/Spawn are haunted by memories of his wife and past
life, and this causes serious inner pain.  And it is this inner pain that
motivates the comic book Spawn to do what he does.  In the movie the only
sign of inner pain is the two or three times that Spawn looks to the sky
and yells "Wanda."  Most of the other time, his acts are just of pure
revenge towards Wynn.
The special effects are the opposite of the story and plot.  They are
spectacular, and this is what is expected from a director who was once a
special effects person.  The most impressive special effect, and least
used, is Spawns cape.  The cape is wonderfully fluid, and if you haven't
seen it in the comic books, the cape stretches for what seems to be miles.
Spawns armor is also pretty impressive, but not as much as the cape.
The ending hints, most definitely, at a sequel.  I hope they do not produce
a sequel if it is going to be another mediocre film as this one.  The movie
moves particularly slow, and I found myself yawning and looking at my watch
constantly throughout the film.  This is a film that I would recommend only
for people to see on video, and only to see for the special effects.  Other
than that, go rent Batman and see a good comic book to silver screen
translation.

Review for Great Expectations (1998)
I've never read Charles Dicken's book Great Expectations. So, I walked into
the theatre with -- sorry -- no expectations of what the film would be like.
Great Expectations starts off somewhere in the 70s. Finn Bill is a 10 year
old orphan boy who lives with his sister and her boyfriend, Joe (Chris
Cooper). Estella is an orphaned 10-year-old girl who has been adopted by a
crazy old rich woman, Miss Dinsmore (Anne Brancroft). Miss Dinsmore is rich
but noticeably looney; she lives in her old mansion and mourns the day, 26
years ago, that her fiancé left her at the alter. Despite warnings from
Miss Dinsmore that Estella will only break his heart, Finn continues to see
Estella weekly.
Finn is a talented artist and he shows this early on in the film. His
drawing brings him to meet an escaped criminal, Lustig. Finn helps out
Lustig, but that story line ends as abruptly as it starts. Finn also draws
a portrait of Estella for Miss Dinsmore early on in the film.
A decade later, Estella is off studying abroad. Finn, who has retreated to
a quiet life as a fisherman with his Uncle Joe, is approached by a lawyer
representing a rich person who wants Finn to go to New York to exhibit his
art. Finn is, at first, resistant to the idea because he has long given up
being an artist, but at last he goes off to New York. He assumes that the
rich person financing his art show is Miss Dinsmore, but is it?
In New York, Finn bumps into Estella. Estella is thinking about marrying an
undecisive man named Walter Plane (Hank Azaria). And it is here that their
old love affair picks up. Finn is a very quiet person and Estella is an icy
cold tease. We are drawn into their relationship and never let go.
Ethan Hawke, doing an uncanny imitation of Tom Cruise, is very likeable in
Great Expectations. Hawke's Finn is spot on with the 10-year old version of
Finn as portrayed by Jeremy Kissner. Gwyneth Paltrow is sexy and icy cold
at the same time. Her Estella is hard to grasp and hard to figure out, but
that is what makes Estella so intriguing to watch. Robert DeNiro makes a
big impression as the escape convict Lustig. But the person who steals the
movie is Anne Brancroft as Miss Dinsmore. She is wonderfully crazy and a
joy to watch on screen. Worth mentioning is Chris Cooper as Uncle Joe. I
really liked the character Uncle Joe; he's a very down to earth and
understanding person.
What stands out in Great Expectations, even more than the wonderful
performances, is the cinematography. The movie simply looks ravishing. The
movie is lush with greens and the camera moves in sensuous ways. I love how
Great Expectations looks. Kudos to cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. 
Also worth mentioning is the artwork by Francesco Clemente. The artwork is
crude yet beautiful.
Great Expectations is a wonderful film with grand performances and a
stunning look. The movie follows the romance of two people from childhood
to adulthood. The story moves exceptionally well, though it starts out
stronger than it ends. Don't Miss Great Expectations in the theatres.

Review for Feiying gaiwak (1990)
Released in 1990, Operation Condor was originally released over-seas as The
Armor of Gods 2:Operation Condor. But seeing the original is not important,
Condor is a self-contained story.
Dimensions Film has put together a new English dubbing and soundtrack for
the US release of the film. This is along with a few edits here and there.
Unlike the previous three Jackie Chan releases (Rumble in the Bronx,
Supercop, and First Strike), which were directed by Stanley Tong, Jackie
Chan is directing, writing, and starring in Operation Condor. Also
different from the previous three releases, Operation Condor has a
different feel to it.
Jackie Chan plays an agent for the UN named Jackie, but code-named Condor.
After a spectacular opening sequence, which is a hilarious parody of the
opening sequence to the first Indiana Jones film, the UN calls Jackie.
There is a stash of gold buried somewhere in the Sahara by some Nazis. The
Nazis stole the gold during World War 2 and buried it at the end of the war
just as they were losing the war. To tag along with Jackie is Ada, a
beautiful Chinese liaison who knows about the gold. But along the way the
grand daughter of the leader of the Nazi group that buried the gold joins
them. Also joining is a Japanese woman who has a pet scorpion.
Jackie and group are battling two groups of men trying to get to the gold
also. But, as most of us know, we don't go to see a Jackie Chan film for
plot and character development. We see Jackie films for action, and there
is plenty of action in Operation Condor. The action consists mostly of
fighting scenes that are all well choreographed and highly entertaining.
There is also the crazy, funny, and silly comedy for which Jackie has the
perfect timing for. Most of the times the comedy will leave a silly grin on
you face.
Of all the re-released Jackie films in the US, this one is the one with the
most action. It is also the one that is most quirky. The film switches
moods quickly and abruptly, but, doing this well. It can go from dead
serious to slapstick comedy in the snap of a finger.
Operation Condor is a funny movie with lots of spectacular action. It is
also a film you'll want to see on the big screen. So, go see it. And don't
leave right when the credits roll because you'll miss the outtakes.

Review for Hard Rain (1998)
Ding! Here's movie number two for my top 10 worst films of 1998 list! I'm
building quite a collection: first fire (Firestorm), now water. I wonder
what other natural wonders January will bring me.
Scripted by Graham Yost, Hard Rain follows Yost's formula: high concept,
low characterizations, and even lower plot. Yost likes to write chase
movies, which is OK, but he tends to write them so formulaic that it's
getting tired now, so please Graham come up with something new. Let me give
you a run down of the films that Yost has written so far: Speed, bomb on
bus, chase down time trying to stop the bomb. Worked well because of, then
rookie cinematographer-turned-director, Jan De Bont's excellent eye for
action and tension. Broken Arrow, stolen nuclear bomb, must chase down the
bomb before it gets blown up. Worked well because of John Woo's style and
excellent eye for action. Hard Rain, stolen money, must chase down money
because the bad guys are greedy. Doesn't work because of the eye of
cinematographer-turned-director Mikael Salomon who muddles up the action
and can't build tension.
Yost, as I pointed out in my Broken Arrow review, needs to have a good
director working on his scripts. If not the scripts fall apart because the
audience is given too much time to think about how ludicrous his scripts
are and because the audience is not convincingly wowed by the spectacular
action. We are given more than enough time to think about Yost's script in
Hard Rain. Hard Rain runs a few minutes over an hour and a half, and it has
got to be the longest, and most painful, hour and a half -- next to
Firestorm -- that I've spent in a theatre in the last few months.
Here's a run down of the premise of the story. During a huge storm in
Huntingburg, Indiana, a group of men lead by Jim (Morgan Freeman) tries to
steal a cool three million dollars from an armor truck. Charlie (Ed Asner),
with Tom (Christian Slater) riding along, is driving the armored truck.
After a shootout, Charlie is dead, Tom has hidden the money, and the chase
is on. Throw in a greedy town sheriff (Randy Quaid) and a
damsel-in-distress (Minnie Driver) and this is what Yost calls a good script. 
Next to a sudden twist near the end of the film, this film is very
predictable and boring. The action is bland and when it is not bland, rain
and some bad camera work muddle it.
Mikael Salomon, who's biggest stint so far was as cinematographer for James
Cameron on The Abyss tries hard to make this film work, but the film is
weighted down by a few factors. The biggest would be the script. Along with
this would be the acting, next to Morgan Freeman, who is always great
onscreen, there are no other good performances. The other performances
range from bland (Minnie Driver) to wimpy (Christian Slater) to silly
(Randy Quiad). There is too much "padding-time." Padding-time is what I
consider time onscreen when there is really nothing except to pad the
movie's running time to the requisite 90 minutes or more. Yost fills this
padding-time with silly one-liners and two old folk (Rick Harris and Betty
White) for comedy relief. Talking about one-liners, Yost doesn't seem to
have a concept about conversation or dialogue. Whenever a character
onscreen opens their mouth, it seems to be either to scream or spit out a
one-liner. And lastly, Christian Slater as Tom just does not work. Ever
since I saw Christian Slater try to become an action hero in Broken Arrow I
was convinced that he couldn't. And he proves it in Hard Rain. Slater is
just a wimp.
The studio-heads change the name of this film from The Flood to Hard Rain
after it performed badly with test audiences. My suggestion to the
studio-heads: should have change a lot more or kept it in the vault. Skip
this film, it's awful.

Review for Deep Impact (1998)
What would you do if you had only a year left to live? How would you spend
your final days on Earth if you knew that all life as we know it would be
wiped out in a year? These two are the major questions pose by 1998's first
of two outer-space-object-strikes-Earth movies, Deep Impact.
The other movie, Armageddon, starring Bruce Willis, will be released later
this summer. Armageddon is billed as the feel-good sibling of these twin
movies. If that were the case, then Deep Impact would be the morose one of
the two. And the film proves that it is. 
Deep Impact starts off with a young astronomy student, Leo Beiderman
(Elijah Wood) discovering a large comet. What he doesn't know is that the
comet is headed straight for Earth and is an E.L.E., extinction level
event. The comet is 7 miles long and 500 billion tons in weight, roughly
the size of Manhattan and the heft of Mt. Everest. The only thing on its
mind is to keep on coming towards Earth. After we learn all of this, the
story falls into a grove that follows a MSNBC reporter, Jenny Lerner (Tea
Leoni), who is investigating a report of a sex scandal in the White House
and stumbles upon the E.L.E. Having poked around a little more, she
discovers enough to "force" the President of the United States (Morgan
Freeman) to announce what is going to happen to the Earth. 
The Americans and Russians have not been sitting idly on their hands
waiting for the comet Wolf-Beiderman to come and wipe out humanity. During
the year that the comet was only known to the two governments, they have
been building a spaceship to fly out to the comet. The plan is to plant
some nuclear devices on the comet and blow it to pieces. This mission
onboard the spaceship "Messiah" is lead by old-timer Spurgeon "Fish" Tanner
(Robert Duvall). The US has also taken other precautions; it has built vast
underground caves that can hold a million people for up to two years. 
The script by Michael Tolkin (The Player) and Bruce Joel Rubin (Ghost)
fails in one way: It tries to look at the disaster from the viewpoint of
too many characters. When I look back at Titanic, the movie works for one
reason: the focus of the story is on only Jack and Rose. Therefore, we can
emotionally bond with them and understand what they are feeling when
disaster strikes. With Deep Impact, though, there are many characters vying
for screen time and they are not given it. This leaves us trying to follow
the stories and trying to identify with a lot of stock, two-dimensional
characters. When disaster strikes, we are not emotionally attached and are
left to seeing images of women giving up children, families reuniting, and
families torn apart. I expected a little bit more from Bruce Joel Rubin. He
wrote a movie that I respect, a mixed horror-thriller named Jacob's Ladder,
a thought provoking film about death and dying. I'm not sure why Bruce Joel
Rubin did not move that same thought provoking type of writing up to the
next level with Deep Impact. 
The big names attached to the film, Freeman, Duvall, and Vanessa Redgrave
are for marketing purposes only. Their parts are marginal at best. Duvall
has the largest of the parts. I'll say this though; Freeman looks and acts
like a real President and is the best onscreen President yet. He's even
better than Harrison Ford (Air Force One). The major part goes to a stiff
Leoni, who doesn't seem comfortable doing newscasts. Leoni, who is a gifted
comedic actress, is somewhat miscast to in the part of Lerner.
Another person out of place is composer James Horner. The score for Deep
Impact is exactly the same score for Titanic minus the haunting vocals. At
some points it sounds as if Horner took a short vacation and had someone
dub in his Titanic score for particular scenes. For those of you familiar
with Horner's work, his scores tend to sound the same: His Titanic score
sounded like his Braveheart score, which in turn sounded like his Apollo 13
score, etc. But his music for Deep Impact is embarrassingly lifted from
Titanic. Shame on you, James. 
Now for the really bad news: If you're going to see Deep Impact for it's
special effects and destruction of eastern seaboard cities, you've seen it
all already in the trailers and TV spots. Yes, we can blame the idiots in
the marketing department for showing all of the good stuff during the
advertisements. I'm unhappy to say that the advertisements are also
somewhat more enjoyable than the film in the department of Earthly
destruction - in the ads we don't have to wait an hour and forty minutes to
see the destruction. Though some of the special effects are stunning - the
huge tidal waves rushing at the screen are phenomenal - some are out of the
1970's. The worst effects the ones portraying the astronauts in space and
on the comet. 
Mimi Leder (The Peacemaker) does an effective job directing Deep Impact.
Though she has tamed her over-usage of steady-cam shots, she is still using
too many of them. A few scenes in Deep Impact could and did make some of
the audience seasick. One example is a shot in the MSNBC newsroom where the
camera continuously spins around stopping to focus on different people
showing their reaction to bad news. Mimi, did we really have to spin the
camera around like that? It doesn't make for a more realistic shot; it
makes for a shot that looks like some teenager with a new camcorder shot
it. One shot that was powerful, though, was of the traffic jam on the
freeway, which made a tingly feeling shoot up my spine. With Deep Impact,
Leder shows us, as with Peacemaker, that she is very able to direct a large
film. With Deep Impact, though, we see that what Leder needs is not a large
cast of A-list players but a good solid script. Leder made good with the
weak Peacemaker script, and she does the same for Deep Impact, but she
deserves more.
Talking about MSNBC, the product placement and affiliations are tremendous
in Deep Impact. For example: Leoni is from NBC's show The Naked Truth,
Leoni's reporter Lerner works for MSNBC, and when Lerner goes to look up
E.L.E. she uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 to search the MSNBC site.
There's the miscellaneous cast: Laura Innes and Ron Eldard from NBC's ER.
And don't forget the people behind the camera: Director Mimi Leder of ER
fame and Producer Steven Spielberg, who also produces ER. It almost seemed
as if Deep Impact was a made-for-TV movie for NBC. 
Deep Impact does bring up a lot of questions that we should ask ourselves.
And it did make me think of some things that I wouldn't have otherwise.
But, it is not as moving as it could have been. I don't hate Deep Impact; I
rather enjoyed it. But, there is one thing that pokes me in the side when I
think about Deep Impact: it could have been so much better with a tighter
script. 
With a name like Deep Impact, the film should have made more of an impact
on the audience. Instead, it only leaves a shallow impact. And with
Godzilla coming out soon, Deep Impact will be nothing more than a Deep
Imprint. Godzilla will easily stomp Deep Impact because of its string of
special effects and bundles of tantalizing ads. Catch Deep Impact at a
theatre near you, but only during a matinee showing. Now I am looking
forward to the second of the objects-from-outer-space films, Armageddon.
I'm sure that the mindless action and continuous special effects of
Armageddon will be the perfect cure for the morose feelings left in me by
Deep Impact.

Review for Die Hard 2 (1990)
I love the Die Hard series and if you were to ask me to rate the three, the
first would be on the top of my list, followed by the third and Die Hard 2
would be the last. For me Die Hard 2 is the weakest of the three, but that
don't mean that it's a bad film at all. It just means that the other two
are a lot stronger than this one. I fell that the missing presence of Die
Hard and Die Hard: With a Vengeance director John McTiernan is what makes
Die Hard 2 a weaker film.
John McClane says that the story of his life is about being in the wrong
place and the wrong time. And that seems to be true. In Die Hard 2, it's
Christmas again and McClane is at the Dulles International Airport waiting
to pick up his wife who is coming home from a business trip. Also at the
airport are some terrorists who are there waiting to pick up their boss,
who is a deposed leader, General Esperanza. Die Hard 2 sets up the story
quickly so that it can move into its amazing action sequences.
Along the way we meet our typical stereotypical characters who are nothing
more than cardboard cut out stock characters that serve the only one of two
purposes: 1) help McClane or 2) die. This is not a problem though because
the story itself is so preposterous that it is actually pretty fun to
watch. Yes, the story is pretty unbelievable but director Renny Harlin does
a good job at keeping the pace quick and brisk. This makes it easy to
suspend your disbelief, actually, it leaves no time for disbelief. And this
is where I see the problem with Die Hard 2, the action is sometimes way too
over-the-top and comes at a pace that is so brute and in your face that
it's painful. Harlin who seems to like to show everything when doing action
sequences shows a lot of unnecessary violences and gore.
Bruce Willis IS John McClane and there's no doubt there. Willis seems so in
touch with the McClane character that he is wholly fun to watch. Dennis
Franz is the lead-in-the-head typical antagonist for the McClane character,
and while Franz fills in the shoes OK, he's not really doing too much
during the film. William Sadler is Stuart, the leader of the terrorist, and
he does a good job with his part. I did like the performance of John Amos
as Grant who shows up halfway through the film.
Die Hard 2 might be the weakest of the series, but it is still a great
action film. Don't miss this one. Willis is made for his part and it is he
who makes this so much fun to watch.

Review for Red Planet (2000)
I love how Hollywood works.  When a film about a particular subject or 
thing comes out there always seems to be another one about just that same 
thing on the heels of it.  For example look at Speed and Blown Away (mad 
bombers), Antz and A Bug's Life (bugs), Matrix and eXistenZ (alternate 
reality).  These types of films are always released a few months away from 
each other and I don't know why because invariably one is far superior to 
the next  usually by a large margin.  This year the thing that is being 
covered twice in theatres is a trip to Mars.  The first out of the gates 
was Brian DePalma's terrible Mission to Mars.  The second is Red Planet and 
Red Planet is what Mission to Mars should have been.
Humans have finally polluted the Earth to the point where habitation on 
this planet is no longer viable.  What is a species supposed to do?  Go 
find another planet to ruin of course.  And this is how Red Planet 
starts.  The opening of the film sets up the story quickly via a voice-over 
by Command Kate Bowman (Carrie-Anne Moss).  We meet the rest of the crew 
quickly, co-pilot Ted Santen (Benjamin Bratt), scientist Dr. Quinn 
Burchenal (Tom Sizemore), Chip Penttengill (Simon Baker), a religious 
scientist Chantias (Terence Stamp), and the space handyman Gallagher (Val 
Kilmer).
Unlike Mission to Mars where a lot of time is spent watching the crew as 
they go to Mars, Red Planet makes the trip quick and easy.  Much of Red 
Planet actually takes place on the planet Mars.  What is interesting and 
also what drew me into the film was writer Chuck Pfarrer's (Darkman) notion 
of how we were going to make Mars inhabitable.  Humans, seeing the demise 
of Earth, sent probes to Mars with algae.  This algae worked to make an 
atmosphere on Mars and eventually the atmosphere would turn habitable and 
breathable.  But, to the surprise of the humans somehow all the algae just 
disappeared one day.  Gone.  And it is this disappearance of the algae that 
the crew, headed by Bowman, is sent to investigate on Mars.  The movie has 
a good and plausible explanation for the disappearance of the algae and it 
keeps you guessing throughout the film.
Did I like Red Planet?  Yes.  I enjoyed the film thoroughly.  Some might 
say that it's a bit long or a bit slow, but I thought it was a good solid 
piece of sci-fi moviemaking.  Kudos to director Antony Hoffman and writer 
Chuck Pfarrer for putting together a believable and enjoyable film.
The actors all do well.  Carrie-Anne Moss again shows that she's up to par 
as an actress and that her first time out in The Matrix was not a 
fluke.  (It's interesting to note that her character's name is a tip of the 
hat to the movie 2001's main character Bowman.)  Val Kilmer is excellent as 
Gallagher.  Kilmer has that exact smugness and immature that the Gallagher 
character calls for and Kilmer shines in the part.  Of the other actors 
Terence Stamp puts out a good performance and so does Tom Sizemore (who is 
always a good and reliable supporting actor).
The special effects in Red Planet were sufficiently good.  The one that I 
loved the most was AMEE the robot that is supposed to navigate Mars for the 
ground crew.  AMEE is frightening and though the robot is not always 
onscreen the frightening presence of "her" is always there.
Red Planet is a good sci-fi flick.  Catch it in theatres if you have a 
chance or catch it on video.  Skip Mission to Mars, Catch Red Planet.

Review for Good Will Hunting (1997)
We've all heard this story line before: Boy-wonder-genius is discovered and
is put to use by scientists.  Then the government finds out and puts the
boy-wonder to work for the government.  Something outrageous is discovered
by the boy as he works for the government and some bad guys come hunting
for the boy, trying to ax him.  All I have to say is: Thank goodness
writers/actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck took a different approach.
Among its several connotations, the title includes the name of the main
character, Will Hunting (Matt Damon).  Will is a young man who has a
special gift for mathematics and other college level learning.  For him,
comprehending difficult theories is as easy as tying his shoelaces.  He can
read at impressive speeds and retain all of the knowledge after one
reading. By no means is Will like Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man; he is a normal
guy with an abnormal talent. He works as a janitor at MIT, and while
cleaning the floors one night, he solves a difficult proof posted on a
chalkboard and catches the attention of a hardworking professor, Lambeua
(Stellan Skarsgĺrd).  Will is thrown in jail after a scuffle with some
punks and Lambeaua sees this as an opportunity to help Will out.  Lambeaua
agrees to get Will out of jail if he will study math with Lambeaua and get
some therapy.  
After driving away a few therapists with his mind games, Will meets one
that can help him.  Sean McGuire (Robin Williams) is from the same part of
town and is never turned away by Will's horrible behavior. The problem with
Will is that he has a lot of talent but he is squandering it by being a
punk and turning down "real world" ideas.  Both Lambeua and McGuire see
this and both want to help Will out.  
Along the way a relationship starts between Will and Skylar (Minnie
Driver).  Although it has meaning within the movie, it seems somewhat
shallow and I would have liked to see the relationship developed more.  We
also get to meet Will's friends, including his best friend, Chuckie (Ben
Affleck). Like the love relationship, the friendships in the film seem
underdeveloped and shallow.
Those are small complaints, though, because the script works well in
tugging at our emotions. The most important relationship is the one between
Will and Sean, his therapist. And it is in this relationship that we find
out why Will is way that he is. We also see that Sean is being helped by Will.
All performances in Good Will Hunting are top-notch.  Matt Damon is on a
roll, first with his starring role in Francis Ford Coppola's The Rainmaker,
and now with his lead role in Good Will Hunting. I can't wait to see what
he's going to do next.  Robin Williams also gives a wonderful performance.
His Professor McGuire is a man with a hard past and Williams is able to get
that across on screen. (I'm also glad to see Williams in a good movie
instead of movies like Flubber and Father's Day.) 
The script by Damon and Affleck milks each and every scene for emotion,
whether a laugh or a tear. In that aspect the script works very well.
Sometimes it feels corny, but it's never bad enough to ruin the film.  Gus
Van Sant Jr., the director, does a wonderful job keeping up the pace.
Worth mentioning is the acoustic and intimate score by Danny Elfman, which
is surprisingly different from his other works. It sounds more like a tame
version of the Midnight Run music than it does his more grand scores, like
Batman.  But, like in all his other films, Elfman never allows the score to
overshadow what is happening on screen.
Good Will Hunting is a great film.  The theme (If you have talent, don't
waste it), comes very close to being inspiring.  The film is definitely a
tear-jerker though.  Don't Miss Good Will Hunting on the big screen.  After
seeing the film, let me know what the title means to you.

Title
Review for Event Horizon (1997)
"Wow!" and "Potential" are the words that popped up in my mind during the
first 20 minutes or so of Event Horizon. Then the phrases "Ugh" and "It had
potential" started to creep in.  In the opening 20 minutes of Event
Horizon, we are treated to some well-done special effects along with some
pretty good ideas for a sci-fi movie. But after we are introduced to these
ideas, we are sent on a path to a typical horror film.
The premise to Event Horizon has so much potential; A ship, Event Horizon,
is built with a special Gravity Drive that will let it tear holes in the
space-time continuum and let it travel across galaxies without any effort.
It does this by first tearing a hole at the two points, the origin and the
destination. Then the Gravity Drive "folds" space-time so that the ship can
be transported to the destination instantaneously. Sam Neill, plays William
Weir, the creator of the Gravity Drive, he explains how the Gravity Drive
works much better in the film. With this kind of start, and this kind of
premise, there is infinite potential on a good solid sci-fi film. But,
screenwriter Philip Eisner lets the script wander to the standard horror
genre, and turns this film into nothing more than a gory not-scary film.
It seems that seven years after the Event Horizon disappeared; it has not
reappeared in orbit around Neptune. A team is dispatched to rescue any crew
onboard the Event Horizon, salvage the Event Horizon, and find out what
happened to the Event Horizon. The team is led by Captain Joe Miller
(Lawrence Fishburne). The team is filled with stock two-dimensional
characters, including one for comic relief. None of the characters are
memorable. Sam Neill's William Weir is tagging along with the team to
advise them. With the look of the film and the strange make up of the team,
it looks almost like the Space Marines from James Cameron's Aliens. But,
unfortunately, the casting for the team is not as strong, and the writing
for the team is not up to par. The Event Horizon it seems has gone to Hell,
or some evil place, and come back. The ship is now haunted, and it has a
new crew to play with, and kill.
As a horror film, Event Horizon does what it can. Using a lot of the
turn-around-to-see-a-scary-thing technique to try to scare the audience. It
also uses very short flashes of images and burst of sound to try to scare
the audience. Most of these work, but after a few of them, I was wondering
if the director was running short of inventive ways to scare the audience.
The good thing about Event Horizon is the look of it. Director Paul
Anderson, who's last film, Mortal Kombat, also looked great, creates a
world that is dark, dingy and scary. The special effects are well done,
these include some long shots of Neptune, complete with whirling storms.
The spacecrafts look great and the interiors of Event Horizon and The Lewis
and Clark are also great. But, all of the looks are lost to a boring,
uninspired, horror film that hardly does what it sets out to do: Scare the
audience.
Sam Neill gives a decent performance as Weir, the smart and somewhat crazed
scientist. Laurence Fishburne is below par, and looks as if he is as bored
with the film as the audience is. The rest of the crew gives forgettable
performances, and I really think that Kathleen Quinlan's (Apollo 13)
talents are wasted in this film.
Event Horizon a film that can be missed in the theatres and on video. It
has a wonderful setup, but does not go through with it. Though it is
visually spectacular, the story is just not there to support it's eye
candy. A definite miss, save your money. Event Horizon has gone to Hell and
has come back, but it seems as if all the fun has been striped of it in Hell.

Title
Review for Primary Colors (1998)
Primary Colors is more than a retelling of the 1992 Clinton campaign; it's
an in-depth look at the political machine.  Surprisingly, the film does not
belong to John Travolta.  Yes, Travolta is in the film, but Adrian Lester
is the one to watch.
Primary Colors follows the presidential campaign of Jack Stanton (John
Travolta) who is a man of virtue that will not go dirty in order to win a
campaign.  He is a man who stops being a politician and starts telling the
truth.  In addition to his headstrong and clear-headed wife, Susan (Emma
Thomson), Stanton has a great campaign team behind him: Daisy Green (Maura
Tierney), Richard Jemmons (Billy Bob Thornton), Libby Holden (Kathy Bates),
and Henry Burton (Adrian Lester).
As in the real Clinton campaign, we have this historical stuff: a
womanizing president, the 'other woman,' and the spin-doctors that try to
hide the Presidential candidate's misdeeds.
The posters feature Travolta and Thomson prominently, but that is only a
way to draw the crowd in.  Yes, they have big roles, but they are not the
main characters.  Henry Burton, played well by Adrian Lester, is the main
character, and we see the campaign through his eyes.  Burton is at first
reluctant to join up with Stanton as his campaign manager.  After seeing
how selflessly Stanton reacted to group of illiterate adults who took their
own time to learn to read, Burton reconsiders.
In addition, we are introduced to the moral issues through him.  Lester
handles his role beautifully and draws us into the film.
The main scene-stealer, next to Lester, is Kathy Bates as the loud
potty-mouthed dirt digger, Libby Holden.  Her character becomes pivotal
late in the movie.  Bates, who I last saw in Titanic, has more to do here
and she handles it well.  I loved the scene in which she goes to talk to a
tabloid news guy about an audio tape.
Travolta is Bill Clinton.  He has the speech patterns, voice, and
mannerisms of Bill Clinton so well that it's scary.  Though Emma Thomson
has nothing in common with Hilary, she plays her part well.
The script by Elaine May is an adaptation of the book by the same name,
written by "Anonymous."  I have not read the book yet, so I cannot comment
on how well the book translated into the screenplay.  As it stands, the
screenplay is well written except for a few details.
Two big details bugged me.  The biggest was the 140-minute running time of
the film.  Director Mike Nichols should have edited some of the scenes.
The other complaint, and this may seem weird, is that the film seems to end
too abruptly.
However, as I drove away from the theatre, the ending seemed fitting and
after a few minutes of thought, I saw how well this ending works.  Most
people, though, will probably think that the ending was a bit forced and
abrupt.
Primary Colors is a good look into a campaign and the continuing dilemma:
should the candidate give up virtue in order to win?  This movie is not as
harsh as Wag the Dog was, but it still attacks Clinton in a softer, more
comical and satirical way.  In the end though, you'll walk out of the
theatre wondering what you would be willing to give up in order to win a
Presidential race.

Review for Contact (1997)
When you look up in the sky late at night, do you ever have the feeling
that another being is doing the same thing light years away? How could
there be so many stars and no other life than just us? It would be a
terrible waste of space wouldn't it?
Contact looks at these questions and more. Based on the Carl Sagan book by
the same name, Contact follows the story of a radio astronomer, Ellie
Arroway (Jodie Foster). Since she was a kid, she has been interested in
radio, and using the radio to find other people, or peoples. Arroway starts
her professional career at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, it is
here where she meets Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a biblical man, who does
not believe in technology. Arroway is working on the SETI (Search for
ExtraTerrestrial Intelligence) project. And, thew work is long and dry.
Long and dry enough for the head of the National Science Foundation, Dr.
Drumlin (Tom Skerritt), to cut their funding.
Arroway then, with the help of her coworkers, get private funding to do
research in New Mexico. The funding comes from an eccentric rich man,
Hadden (John Hurt). And after two years of searching, they have yet to turn
something up. So, yet again, Drumlin steps in and wants the project to be
shutdown, because the radio telescopes could be used for more "practical"
projects. But, before the project is cancelled, Arroway and team get The
Message from a star named Vega.
All of that build up takes place in the slow introductory forty minutes.
>From there, director, Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future
series), tries to explore the effect The Message has on science and
religion. And how the two are in conflict with each other. It is here that
the movie picks up the pace, but only by a little. We see Arroway go
through letdown after letdown. The payoff for all of these letdowns, slow
intro, and religious/science exploration, is good but not as satisfying as
can be.
The opening sequence sets the pace for the movie, and has to be seen it's
an incredible sequence.
Worth mentioning is John Hurt as the eccentric man, Hadden. Hurt gives a,
short, but brilliant performance. His character is, for me, one of the most
memorable characters in the movies of summer 1997. Jodie Foster gives a
solid performance, as usual. The special effects, although never
overshadowing the characters and story, are incredible. The opening
sequence, close to the end sequence, and machine are unbeatable. I've not
finished reading the book, but so far the movie sticks pretty much to the
book. And this could be accounted for because of Sagan and his wife
producing the film.
I have only a few complaints. The movie is just a bit on the long side,
running around two and half-hours. Zemeckis uses the same sort of T.V. type
inserts as Forrest Gump, but there seems to be an over use of it in
Contact. Sometimes it seems that he used T.V. footage just to give the
movie a documentary feel. The score from Alan Silvestri is easily forgettable.
Though I have some complaints, Contact is a wonderful movie. It is by far
one of the best sci-fi films to be released lately. And being the summer
film season, it is a film unlike most other summer films, intelligent. I
highly recommend Contact.

Review for Under Siege 2: Dark Territory (1995)
It's hard to force myself to watch Steven Seagal movies.  But, since I
enjoyed Under Siege so much, I thought I'd catch Under Siege 2 for fun.
As introduced in the first film, Steve Seagal's character, Casey Ryback is
a Navy cook.  But, are we to believe that's all he is?  Heck no.  Ryback is
really a highly trained Navy SEAL who is able to disable or kill men with a
chop of his hands.  He knows many ways to inflict pain to bad guys, and he
shows us many.
In Under Siege 2 Casey has retreated to a quiet life as a cook in a big
restaurant.  Customers come to visit the restaurant not because of the good
food but because of Seagal's shiny personality.  Like many other
professions, you can take the man out of the Navy, but you can't take the
Navy out of the man.  When needed Ryback still goes active with the Navy on
top secret tasks.  Casey's brother just died and Casey needs to get out
West to pay his respects.  Tagging along is his niece-with-an-attitude
(Katherine Heigl).  Since Casey doesn't like to fly, he and his niece take
a train out West.
Unknowingly to Casey a high-tech group of men want to earn some money and
use this train as their mobile headquarters.  The group of men wants to
earn their money by using a new Navy satellite to strike terror in the
heart of the US.  They are going to destroy the Pentagon with the satellite
which can cause natural-looking earthquakes.
The story is enough to string along the action sequences.  The action
sequences are fun but rather generic.  None of the memorable.  Also, Seagal
isn't allowed to show off much of his martial arts skills.  Some of those
fighting sequences also use some laughable techniques, including one that
sped up the film.
As with most all of Seagal's other films, all the characters are one
dimensional cardboard cutouts. Eric Bogosian as the crazed villain, Dane,
doesn't come close to Tommy Lee Jone's crazed villain in the first film.
And director Geoff Murphy isn't able to create as much excitement as Andrew
Davis did in the first.  Steven Seagal, well, he is Steve Seagal.  His one
scene where he has to show some emotion is quite laughable.
Worth mentioning is Basil Poledouris' score for the film.  This is a very
thematic score and works well with the film.
Under Siege 2 feels different than the first.  The first had a more serious
and believable feel to it.  This sequel has a silly feel to it and some
parts are utterly unbelievable.  This is shown with a version of the
run-faster-than-a-fireball sequence with a twist. (Lets just say the
fireball is replaced with a train).
Though not as good as the first, Under Siege 2:Dark Territory is inevitably
fun.  If you have two hours to spare, catch Under Siege 2:Dark Territory on
video.

Review for Blown Away (1994)
It's funny how films of the same type get released so closely together.
Maybe it's a Hollywood studio thing, but it happens.  In 1994 the type of
film that got released was the "mad bomber" type.  The two films were Speed
and Blown Away.
In Blown Away a mad bomber is on the loose in Boston where he seeks
revenge.  Tommy Lee Jones who carries an Irish accent plays the mad bomber.
 The person he seeks revenge against is a police officer, who not to our
surprise, is in the bomb disposal unit and is played by Jeff Bridges.  
Blown Away is completely implausible, the major thing drawing to this
implausibility is: How the heck does Tommy Lee Jones' character have time
to create so many intricate bombs?  There's a bomb in a computer in MIT's
computer lab, a bomb in a set of earphones, a bomb on a boat, and wait, a
bomb in a car.  There are a few other bombs also.
The difference between the bomb Blown Away and the hit Speed is in the
title.  Blown Away is slow and Speed is fast.  And though Speed was just as
implausible as Blown Away, the film was just fun to watch and it moved
along at a quick brisk pace that allowed the audience to forget about the
implausibility and concentrate on the fun.  Blown Away tries to fill in the
time between the blasts with back-stories and human interest.  The
back-stories include the motivation for the Tommy Lee Jones character and
the human interest includes Bridges new wife.
Had director Stephen Hopkins cut down Blown Away's running time and tighten
up the script a bit, it might have been a fun movie to watch.  Hopkins does
have the eye for tension; my favorite scene was the one in which Bridge's
new wife and child are in the kitchen cooking dinner.
Blown Away lost in 1994 and for good reason, this film is implausible but
on top of that it slow.  If you're looking for a good mad bomber movie to
see go rent Speed.  If you want to see a bomb, see Blown Away.

Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
Heh, haven't laughed this hard while watching a movie in a long time. I 
must say, The Whole Nine Yards is one of the funniest films I've seen in a 
long while.
What would you do if you found out a gunman-for-hire just moved in next 
door? Easy, go befriend him. Nicholas (Matthew Perry) just meet his new 
neighbour, Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski (Bruce Willis). In the quiet 
neighbourhood where Nicholas lives everything is about to change. See, 
Nicholas is a nice guy, but definitely a loser. He's a dentist that's in a 
bad marriage and he's worth more dead than alive. It's hard to say anything 
about the plot without giving away the movie, so I'll stop there. But, lets 
just say that there are a lot of characters in this movie, and all of them 
are well written. And all of them have something to do with another of 
them. The web in which these characters are woven into is intricate and 
this all works out rather well for a comedy.
Mitchell Kapner has put together a wonderfully detailed and funny script 
with The Whole Nine Yards. The movie is captivating. On top of the 
wonderful script are wonderful performances. Perry does great on the big 
screen (finally). Willis is having a good change of image. His comedic side 
is really strong and he shows just that here in The Whole Nine Yards. Other 
performances worth mentioning are: Michael Clarke Duncan as Frankie Figs, 
another hired gun; Rosanna Arquette as Nicholas' scheming wife; and Amanda 
Peet as Jill St. Claire, Nicholas' receptionist who knows more than 
Nicholas thinks.
If you're looking for a good laugh, rent The Whole Nine Yards. It's a 
hilarious film that will have you in stitches by the time the credits roll. 
Don't Miss The Whole Nine Yards.

Title
Review for Wag the Dog (1997)
Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes with Presidential spin control?
What happens when a President -- who's up for re-election in a few days --
does something really horrible? How do you deal with this problem? Confront
the problem head on? Attack the problem from the side? No, hire a spin
control artist and just make people forget about the problem all together.
The President in Wag the Dog has a 17% lead in the polls. But, he has done
something wrong. Something completely wrong that will send his 17% lead
down the toilet. What's he done? Did he kill someone? Did he steal
something? Political policy gone awry? No, think Girl Scout -- actually,
Firefly girl. Think young.
So, what's a top Presidential aide, Winifred Ames (Anne Henche), going to
do? Bring in the best spin doctor around, Conrad Bream (Robert De Niro).
Bream has an idea on how to control the situation -- just steer the
attention away from the Firefly girl for long enough to get the President
re-elected. And what better to get the attention of the American people
than a war? Bream contacts a Hollywood producer, Stanley Motss (Dustin
Hoffman), about producing a war. Motss likes the idea and is willing to
produce the war. And from here the US goes to war with Albania. And the
dirt hungry American people have forgotten about the Firefly girl and have
taken up with the war in Albania.
Wag the Dog is a hilarious satire about how close Hollywood and politics
really are. How Hollywood and politics really do hold hands together. But,
it goes a bit farther than that, Wag the Dog shows how Hollywood, politics,
and the media in general are holding hands with each other. This is an
intelligent film that has something for us to think about, but all the
while not burdening us too hard with it.
The actors in Wag the Dog seem to be having a great time. De Niro is
playing a part he usually doesn't get to play, and that is the part of
someone who is not out to break your face or kill you. De Niro gets to play
a brilliant and intelligent man who is out to help the President. And he
does a great job with this. Henche, coming off her awful performance in I
Know What You Did Last Summer, does a great job with her part as the
Presidential aide who is willing to do just about anything to get the
President re-elected. And Hoffman is just superb as Hollywood producer
Motss. Among these leads are many cameos throughout the film which are
absolutely hilarious to see. Among the cameos is Kirsten Dunst as an
Albanian girl in some news footage, Denis Leary as some sort of creative
guy, Willie Nelson as a musical guy, William H. Macy as a CIA guy, Craig T.
Nelson as the Presidential opponent, Woody Harrelson as a military guy, and
James Belushi as himself.
The script by Hilary Henkin and David Mamet is intelligent and funny. The
direction by Barry Levinson is steady. And worth mentioning is the
wonderful music by Mark Knopfler. The only nitpicking that I have about the
film is the spotty camera work. Most of the camera work is great with the
exception of a few shots which just feel wrong -- to be specific there are
some quick zooms that felt out of place.
Wag the Dog is definitely a Don't Miss Film. I found myself laughing out
loud, along with the audience, during most of the film. The performances
are great and the cameos are even better. And you'll want to see the film
to find out why dogs wag their tails.

Title
Review for Get Carter (2000)
It was the slick poster and the slick trailer of Get Carter that got me 
into the theatre to watch this film.  Had it not been for that, I probably 
would have waited for video to see this movie starring aging action star 
Sylvester Stallone.  So, was it worth the trip?
Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone) is a brutal hitman who travels to Seattle 
for his brother's funeral.  When he gets to Seattle he finds that his 
brother's death may not be what it was said to be and Carter sets out to 
find the killer.  In Seattle, Carter returns to his old life where people 
fear him.  Where he is the local tough guy, the bad guy.  He meets his old 
bad buddies, like Cyrus (Mickey Rourke).  He meets his troubled niece 
Doreen (Rachael Leigh Cook) who somehow is connected to everything that is 
happening in the movie.  There is a thread about Carter's affair with his 
boss' wife but that never gets full treatment and feels tacked on.
Get Carter is a remake of the 1971 version.  I've not seen the original, so 
I can't comment on how the two compare.  But, looking at the credits it's 
nice to see Michael Caine who played Jack Carter in the original taking a 
larger role in this remake.  The story of Get Carter is nothing 
special.  It does have its twists and turns, but it sometimes lost me.  The 
film will also make you laugh with its subtle humor  Stallone delivers some 
of his lines with comedic perfection.
So, what's the hook of Get Carter?  Style.  The style that Get Carter is 
shot is so different that at points it distracts from the story.  But, I 
loved it.  The style in which Get Carter is shot gives the film a sort of 
charm that if it did not have, it would not have been so enjoyable.  Kudos 
to director Stephen T. Kay, cinematographer Mauro Fiore, and editor Jerry 
Greenberg for an injection of style into what would have otherwise been a 
bland film.
How's Stallone?  Perfect.  Stallone gives one of his best performances in 
recent memory.  Kudos to Stallone for one great performance.  The other 
good performance is Rachael Leigh Cook.  Mickey Rourke turns in a nice 
performance and is genuinely tough on screen.
Catch Get Carter, you'll be entertained throughout it's running time.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
The chances of an ordinary guy like myself bumping into Julia Roberts is
less likely than me winning the lottery. And the chances of me bumping into
her and then getting a kiss? I don't even want to consider it. It is this
kind of what-if scenario that makes Notting Hill so enjoyable.
William (Hugh Grant) Thacker is an ordinary guy who lives in Notting Hill.
He owns a travel bookstore that is deep in debt, his wife divorced him for
a guy who looks like Harrison Ford and he now lives in the house that they
bought together. He has a flatmate that's a disgusting, though hilarious,
guy. One day his whole life changes when the world famous actress Anna
(Julia Roberts) Scott walks into his bookstore. The fun and odd romance
starts from this point. Odd in the sense that in Notting Hill the typical
movie gender roles are reversed. Thacker is put into the position of the
person at home waiting and wondering. And Anna is the one off in the world
working.
The best thing about Notting Hill is that the two main actors are doing
parts that they have been doing for a long time. The parts that Grant and
Roberts are attempting in Notting Hill are familiar, both to the viewers
and to the two actors. Which makes a original but familiar feeling movie.
The first hour of Notting Hill is absolutely hilarious. The second hour
keeps some of the humour from the first hour but becomes a bit more
heartbreaking as it continues. The second hour does lose some of the first
hour's steam, but this isn't a big deal. My favourite moment of the film is
when Anna and William jump a gate to take advantage of a private park. From
the moment they arrive at the gate, this sequence had me laughing. The
scene ends on a sweet note with Anna discovering a park bench with an
inscription on it.
Julia Roberts is back at the top of her game now that she is doing the
roles that fit her best. Roberts has always been a romantic-comedy type
actress. Her roles in romantic-comedy films have always been hits (Pretty
Woman, My Best Friend's Wedding), while her roles in dramatic and otherwise
have been lukewarm at best (Mary Reilly). My Best Friend's Wedding is still
my favourite film of Roberts, but, Notting Hill comes up a close second. No
matter what you think of Hugh Grant, he's a good actor. His bumbling-guy
act is ingenious and works well in Notting Hill. This bumbling-guy
("Oopsie-daisies") act is what makes us like him in the film and bond with
his character. If it weren't for this, I don't think that his character
would have worked out. The two leads share tangible screen chemistry and
this also helps.
Someone worth mentioning is actor Rhys Ifans as William Thacker's flat-mate
Spike. Ifans is hilarious as Spike. Every time that Ifans is on screen it's
a laugh-out-loud moment. Look for his performance in the film, he steals
the movie. Another thing worth mentioning is the film score by Trevor
Jones. The score consists mostly of an acoustic guitar and fits the film
like a glove. It's a shame that the score hasn't been released on its own
CD, but you can find bits of the score on the Notting Hill soundtrack.
Notting Hill may not be the most original film, but it has all the right
elements to make it a Don't Miss film. If you're not planning on seeing
Star Wars: Episode I  The Phantom Menace, or are waiting for the lines to
die down, Notting Hill is the perfect film to catch. Don't Miss Notting Hill.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
When I read Scott B. Smith's book A Simple Plan, I was enthralled with the
book almost all the way up to the end. When I heard that a film based on
the book was coming out, I was excited to see it.  Is this film as good as
the book?  And did it live up to my expectations?
One winter day, two brothers, Hank (Bill Paxton) and Jacob Mitchell (Billy
Bob Thornton), and Jacob's friend, Lou, find a crashed plane in a snowy
field. What they find inside the plane is intriguing: a duffle bag with
$4.4 million dollars in it. What does one do? What would you do? These
three strike a deal, a simple plan to keep the money. They take the money
and hide it until summer comes. When the snow melts and someone finds the
plane, they'll see if anyone is looking for the money. If not, they split
the money between themselves.
Sounds easy enough, but three's a crowd  and we all know how hard it is to
keep a secret between three people. To make matters worse Jacob and Lou are
drunkards and don't have well and stable lives like Hank. Jacob and Lou are
poor and with every passing day that money looks more enticing to split
early. A Simple Plan follows Hank who before the money, lived a fairly
normal life. His wife (Bridget Fonda) is pregnant with their first child
and he holds a stable job at a local feed store as an accountant. But, the
large amount of money is just too big a draw for everyone involved and the
simple plan starts to unravel rather quickly. Lines are drawn, sides are
picked, and eventually everything is spinning out of control. All moral
beliefs that the characters might have held fall to the wayside in order to
clear a path to the money. This movie is a superb look at ordinary people
stuck in an extraordinary situation.
The script by Scott B. Smith fixes all the flaws that were in his book. The
biggest of them was the ending of the book. The ending in the book gets way
out of hand and goes overboard into absurdity. In the film, Smith writes a
more believable and satisfying ending. Kudos to Smith for translating an
already impressive book into an even better film.
Sam Raimi is best known for his more eccentric work like the Evil Dead
series and Darkman. With A Simple Plan, Raimi graduates into the more
serious side of filmmaking and also expands into a genre with a wider
audience. Not lost though is Raimi's style. He has a very distinct style in
his films; the offbeat humour and the subtly over-the-top feeling in some
situations. Two strong images that Raimi introduces in the film are the
opening chicken-fox images and the continuous one of the crow. I hate
talking about symbolism, but the crow was a particularly effective one.
"They just wait till something dies," one of the characters observes. Using
the crows, Raimi and Smith makes a simple observation that these characters
are not driven by evil, but they are driven by nature.
Bill Paxton is a face that most people recognize but can't connect to a
name. He's an actor who does a lot of supporting roles (Titanic, True Lies)
and sometimes he holds a leading role (Twister). With A Simple Plan he
should gain that much needed name/face recognition that he deserves. His
performance in A Simple Plan is right on the nose from what I thought his
character was like in the book.
Billy Bob Thornton, like always, gives a wonderful performance. The look
that he adopts for A Simple Plan is absolutely revolting, but strangely
enough it works. Thornton is able to make us sympathetic to him, even
though we see that his character is a lazy drunk.
Fonda is not given as much to do in the film as her character had in the
book. In the book her character is changed from sweet and innocent to
conniving and sneaky. And although this change does happen in the film, it
doesn't happen as well as it did in the book.
The cinematography and film score are worth mentioning. The cinematography
by Alar Kivilo is gorgeous. The snow fields are most memorable, but there
are small moments like the one in Jacob's apartment that stand out. The
film score by Danny Elfman is brilliant. Subtly urging the audience in
different directions, Elfman writes a score that fits the film like a
glove. Although this score is not as good as some of Elfman's other works,
Batman and Midnight Run for example, it is a score to remember.
A Simple Plan is not simply a good movie. A Simple Plan is one of the best
movies I've seen so far this year. Don't Miss A Simple Plan on the big screen.
[Rated R for violence and language. Running Time: 121 Minutes]

Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
Girl, Interrupted is a Don't Miss film. It is also, whole-heartedly, a 
Winona Ryder film.
Girl, Interrupted follows a troubled girl named Susanna Kaysen (Ryder) who 
may or may not have a borderline personality disorder. After Susanna tries 
to kill herself, she is sent to a mental institution by her parents to 
recover. What we see is that Susanna doesn't really have a disorder but is 
more of a slacker who spoils herself. At the institution, Claymore, she 
meets all sorts of women with real disorders. The most enigmatic is Lisa 
(Angelina Jolie) who is a sociopath. The two befriend each other and we see 
their friendship bloom then wither. Girl, Interrupted is about a girl who 
discovers herself, and does just that in a mental institution. The story is 
based on the memoirs of Susanna Kaysen and covers about two years of her 
life starting in 1967.
The performances are excellent. Ryder as Kaysen puts up a wonderful 
performance. Jolie does well also, but I'm starting to think that although 
she is a wonderful actress and is always believable, her range in roles is 
not as wide. She's always doing a rebellious type and though she does it 
good, I wish she would expand her roles a bit. It was good to see Whoopi 
Goldberg in the film as the head of the ward that Susanna and Lisa live in.
Worth mentioning is the score by Mychael Danna which works very well with 
the movie. The song selection for the movie is also excellent. The music in 
the film ties in very well.

Title
Review for Vita č bella, La (1997)
Life is Beautiful is two films in one. The first part is a lighthearted
comedy and the second is a dark and depressing look at the Holocaust. It's
too bad that director/actor/writer Roberto Benigni wasn't able to split
this movie into two different films. While a substantive film, Life is
Beautiful leads the viewers down one path and then transports them to
another going in the opposite direction.
During the lighthearted and often hilarious first hour of the film we get
the setup and the background of the film. Guido (Benigni) is an Italian
countryman who moves to the big city. He dreams of opening a bookstore. On
the way to the city he bumps into a beautiful woman, Dora (Nicoletta
Braschi) for whom he falls madly in love with. Guido ultimately wins the
heart of Dora and they are married. As the first hour ends, the mood and
tone of the film changes abruptly. The audience who has been laughing
during this first hour is suddenly taken into a more morose hour.
Five years later Guido and Dora are still happily married and are raising
their five-year-old son. Plus, Guido has finally gotten his bookstore. Not
all is well in Italy though. The Nazi's have taken more of the country and
the political atmosphere is not the best  especially for the Jews, as is
pointed out by a sign hanging on a shop window that reads, "No Jews or dogs
allowed." The pinnacle of the Nazi infestation of Italy finally takes its
toll on the family. Guido, his wife, and son are taken to a concentration
camp. It is here that the movie turns dark and depressing.
When someone falls, it hurts much more when they fall from a higher place.
Benigni does just this to the audience, intentionally or not, by starting
out lighthearted and then going dark. The lightheartedness of the first
hour brings the audience up high and then as we go into the second hour
Benigni just lets the audience fall. For me, I could have done without this
switch in tone, which made the film all that much more depressing. And
although Guido is constantly the clownish man trying to keep his son happy
in the concentration camp, there is always a sense of dread hanging in the
air during the second hour.
What would have been better would have been to split this movie into two
complete films. Although the first part of the film is there to set
everything up, it could have been a good romantic comedy. And the second
half of the film is a deep and touching Holocaust film that would have made
more of an impact standing alone. Together, though, these two parts make
for a film that misleads you to start and then puts you on a sad track
afterwards. Ultimately, the film is about the strength that comes from the
human spirit and the sacrifices that people make during their times of
suffering.
The one standout thing about Life is Beautiful is the film's score. The
score by Nicola Piovani is excellent with one of the most memorable themes
I've heard lately. It is light when it needs to be and powerful when the
time comes. And never is the score overpowering. Kudos to Piovani for this
wonderful film score.
Don't Miss Life is Beautiful, but be forewarned that this is a pretty bleak
film. I didn't get this warning ahead of time and I am still quite
depressed after my screening of the film.

Review for My Best Friend's Wedding (1997)
My Best Friend's Wedding is the second romantic comedy that I've seen this
summer.  The other was Jennifer Aniston's Picture Perfect.  The difference
between these two summer of 1997 romantic comedies?  My Best Friend's
Wedding is a funny, witty, and touching film.
Julia Roberts, who also stars in this summer's Conspiracy Theory, is
Julianne Potter.  Julianne Potter is a food critic.  She is three weeks
away from her 28th birthday, and she remembers a crazy promise that she
made with her best friend (who was her previous boyfriend nine years ago).
If either of them did not get married by the time that they turned 28, they
would marry each other.  And that day Julianne gets a call from, whom else
but, her best friend, Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney).  The call is not a
proposal, as she was expecting, but an invitation to his wedding.  It turns
out that Michael, the only love of her life for the last nine years, is
getting married to a 20 year old junior in college, Kimmy Wallace (the
stunning Cameron Diaz).  Kimmy is the daughter of the owner of the White
Sox and a cable network.  Now, Julianne has four days to sabotage the
wedding and win Michael back.
It's not too easy to guess how the movie is going to end, and this is
because of the well-written script by Ronald Bass (Dangerous Minds, Joy
Luck Club).  And although, it is sometimes hard to agree with what Julianne
is doing, we are always with her.  Director P.J. Hogan took every effort to
put Julia Roberts in every scene, and this is a really good thing because
Roberts is just luminous.
Julia Roberts gives a great performance as the crazed and desperate
Julianne.  She has great comic timing, and like always, lights up a scene
with her smile and her big eyes.  Cameron Diaz also gives a great
performance as Kimmy, the wonderfully perfect wife-to-be for Michael.  Her
look is different from The Mask or Feeling Minnesota, this time around it
is soft and innocent.  Dermot Mulroney, who was in CopyCat and The Trigger
Effect, gives a bland but good performance as the love interest of Julianne
and Kimmy.  But the show stealer, next to Roberts, would be Rupert Everett
as George, Julianne's gay editor.  Everett, who could have been a great
cast as Michael, gives a grand performance.  And it is his character that
seems to be the only sane character in the whole movie.
The opening credits were strange, to say the least, but they give a hint as
to some of the silliness that comes during the movie, and they work well in
that respect.  The movie score (James Newton Howard) is good, but somewhat
forgettable.  But, the music that is used during the film fits in very
well, and works to make the mood.
My Best Friend's Wedding is well deserved as this summer's sleeper hit.  It
is a funny, witty, and touching film that entertains throughout its two
hours.  Julia Roberts is wonderful as the crazed woman, and gives a much
better performance here than she did in Conspiracy Theory.  My Best
Friend's Wedding is definitely the date-movie of this summer.  Don't miss
this one in the theatres.

Review for X Files, The (1998)
Don't Miss The X-Files: Fight The Future!
Am I biased? Maybe. I've been an X-Files watcher since episode one and
haven't missed an episode since. I buy anything with the X-Files logo or
name on it: I have stacks of X-Files books, an X-File cup, X-Files posters,
fan.
I guess you can imagine the wait I endured after I heard in June of 1997
that The X-Files movie was starting its shoot. When the teasers hit the big
screen I was ecstatic; my two favourite FBI agents were going to be on the
big screen.
The X-Files: Fight The Future has to do two things: It has to satisfy the
die-hard X-Philes, like myself, and it has to entertain casual viewers.
Does the film do both?
The X-Files starts with three TV-style teaser bits. The first starts us off
in 35,000 BC, in the area of Texas. The second brings us to present time in
the same place. The third is longer, more exciting, and is a fitting
introduction to our favourite heroes.
The third TV-style teaser shows a bomb blowing off the front face of a
building in Texas. Special Agents Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully
(Gillian Anderson) are being blamed for the explosion and the resulting
deaths. Mulder doesn't want to be the scapegoat in such an incident and
coerces Scully into investigating in order to clear their names. The
investigation leads to the duo finding out more than we can imagine.
If I tell you what the investigation turns up, I'll be spoiling the film
for you. But, let me give you some hints to what it turns up: informants in
dark alleys, a Smoking Man, a Well-Manicured Man, a deadly virus, corn
crops, bees, and more questions than answers.
Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files, during the filming of the movie
bombarded us X-Philes with misinformation, trying to keep the plot a
secret. He did a good job. The last few episodes of The X-Files TV show
builds up the story that leads into the film. But, there is no prerequisite
of having seen the TV show to thoroughly enjoy the film. Carter, who wrote
the screenplay for the movie, does an incredible job of introducing us to
the characters and doing exposition in ways that don't scream "This is a
speech to fill you in on background and characters!" Watch for Mulder in
the bar to see how Carter intelligently hides exposition in a speech that
fits into the story so well. Also look for the scene where Mulder and
Scully come to a fork in the road; this scene so fittingly shows how well
these two work together.
As for the performances of the leads, both Duchovny and Anderson make the
leap from the small screen to the big screen without a hitch. Duchovny
brings his trademark under-acting to the big screen along with his dry
humor. Anderson looks stunning on the big screen. She brings her trademark
stoic acting to the screen along with her now famous scream, "MULDER!"
Kudos to both Duchovny and Anderson for not trying something new for the
big screen version of the show.
Among the supporting cast, Martin Landau and Armin Mueller-Stahl are
standout performances. I was sad not to see Krycek (aka "Ratboy") in the
film and was somewhat disappointed with the small role that the Smoking Man
(William B. Davis) was given. Other X-Files regulars show up also,
including Assistant Director Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Lone Gunmen (Dean
Haglund, Bruce Harwood, Tom Braidwood), and The Well Manicured Man (John
Neville).
Worth mentioning are the score by Mark Snow and the wonderful
cinematography by Ward Russell. Snow's score is haunting and rhythmic.
Russell's cinematography is the big screen extension of his work on the
small screen. The film is dark and moody.
A regular director on the TV series, Rob Bowman, directs this big screen
version and keeps the movie clipping along at a good pace. He also keeps
the scares coming.
The X-Files: Fight The Future is a two hour-long big budget episode of the
TV series. It is exciting to see Duchovny and Anderson together on the big
screen. The movie itself serves its purpose well: it satisfies the die-hard
viewers. I do feel that the casual watchers will get more satisfaction out
of the film, though. Carter promised a lot when he promoted the film ("The
truth is revealed") and there are still a lot of remaining questions, but
that doesn't bother me because there's a sixth season of The X-Files right
around the corner. The film serves to reinvigorate the series and to
revitalize the story line. It also serves to introduce new viewers to some
of the intriguing stories that are in The X-Files universe. Thank you,
Chris Carter for putting out a wonderful movie that extends the small
screen X-Files to the big screen. Don't Miss The X-Files!

Review for Sphere (1998)
I've read all but one of Michael Crichton's books (The Great Train Robbery)
and seen all but three of his book-to-film adaptations (The Great Train
Robbery, The Andromeda Strain, and Congo).  Of the Crichton books that I've
read, Sphere is my favourite.  So, as you might have guessed, I was really
looking forward to seeing how well the movie adaptation of Sphere turned out.
Sphere is an early Crichton book.  It's also one of his best books.  Though
all of his books are interesting and include interesting ideas, some of
them don't take full advantage of the ideas presented.  And of those, the
movie adaptations always come out worse than the books.  Sure, the book
Jurassic Park had a good idea and a good director behind it, but as a movie
it was completely wrong.  It was cut down to a shallow and somewhat boring
movie that drove people to the theatres because of its amazing sound and
special effects.  The Lost World was a weak book, which created an even
weaker movie.  Disclosure and Rising Sun had some good ideas and came out
OK onscreen.  Sphere makes it almost unscathed from book to screen.
Sphere is written in a way that it is hard to give a synopsis of the story
without giving away crucial plot points.  So, I'll work my way around the
plot points.  Sphere follows Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman, this
characters name is Norman Johnson in the book) a psychologist who wrote a
paper for the Bush administration about policies and procedures if ever an
alien species were to come to Earth.  In his paper, the Goodman Paper,
Norman outlines a group of individuals who would form a team that would
meet with the aliens.  That included himself, a biochemist (Sharon Stone),
a mathematician (Samuel L. Jackson), and an astrophysicist (Liev  Schieber).
What we find out is that there has been an apparent spaceship crash in the
middle of the Pacific and this team of experts is gathered together to
greet whatever is on the ship.  But, the twist is that the ship has been
underwater for almost 300 years.  We also find out that Norman wrote the
Goodman Paper not as a serious paper but to earn some extra cash.  "Whoever
reads government documents?"  Norman tries to explain.
Like all other Crichton books and movies, Sphere is both entertaining and
somewhat educational.  But, let's not put too much emphasis on the latter.
Sphere though is highly entertaining and the first half of the film is
captivating.  The latter half of the film gets a little water logged and we
kind of slush through it.  It is not as bad as it sounds though.
Barry Levinson directs Sphere and with Sphere Levinson has two movies on
the market right now both of them starring Dustin Hoffman.  The other film
is Wag the Dog, which is a smarter and stronger film than Sphere.  Levinson
has a style in his films that is hard to describe.  The style is quick with
flashy cuts during dialogue, but it's hard to nail down.  It is a
fascinating style.  Levinson is able to keep the film moving along at a
fast pace and keep the scares coming.  Most of the scares are more
psychological than the type where something jumps out at you. 
The script by Stephan Hauser and Paul Attanasio is tight and follows
closely to the book.  But, don't go for a bathroom break or to get food,
you'll miss a lot if you do.  The script is a bit tighter than it should
be, squeezing in a lot of material.  The script doesn't take itself all too
seriously at all times.  There is a high level of humor running through the
script to ease some of the tensions brought on by Levinson's direction.  
With all book-to-movie conversions there are going to be cuts from the book
to the script.  And there are many cuts from the book to the script for
Sphere.  Though many are not important, there are some interesting things
that were cut which I would have liked to see in the film.  Some of them
include the form fitting chairs, more of the interior of the spaceship, and
the huge battle with the monster.  My only big complaint is that there are
too many unanswered questions left after the movie is over (and this goes
for the book also).  I would have like to have more explanation of what
happened and how things happened.
Performances are all strong.  I originally thought that the casting was a
bit strange; come on Dustin Hoffman in another action movie?  He looked
highly uneasy in Outbreak can he really pull this one off?  Hoffman does
well in Sphere.  Sharon Stone was another that I doubted, but her
performance is strong also.  I loved her new short haircut.  Nice.  The
only one that I thought was cast perfectly was Samuel L. Jackson.  The part
of Harry Adams was custom made for Samuel L. Jackson.
The obvious comparison for Sphere, at first, is a comparison to James
Cameron's The Abyss.  But, as you find out after the first few minutes of
Sphere is that the two movies are far apart.  Cameron's The Abyss has a
stronger story with more fleshed out characters and better underwater
cinematography.  In comparison Sphere's characters are not one dimensional,
but they are also not as well written as Cameron's Bud and Lindsey.  And
the underwater cinematography in Sphere is a bit more murky and hard to
make out than The Abyss.
There are some things to keep in mind when viewing Sphere.  In the early
scenes of the movie look for Huey Lewis as the helicopter pilot.  I thought
he looked familiar but couldn't put a finger on it.  Sphere also continues
with Hollywood's obsession with minorities being killed off first.  This
time it's Queen Latifah (Set It Off) getting the ax first.
To date Sphere is the best movie adaptation of a Crichton book.  And since
it is my favourite Crichton book, I'm happy that it is such a good
conversion.  One more thing that was left out and I thought should have
been in the movie was the little twist at the end of the book.  This twist
made the book more enjoyable than the film.  If you like Crichton's
writing, especially his early stuff, then Sphere will be a good choice for
you.  Don't Miss Sphere at the theatres.  This is a fun film that will keep
you at the edge of your seat for the entire running length.

Review for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)
My mom taught me that if I haven't got anything good to say about
something, then I should keep quiet. It'll be hard to find something good
to say about Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, so I'll have to break that rule
for just one review.
I enjoyed the original Mortal Kombat movie, it was a fun movie. When it
made a bucket-load of money, I figure the studio heads also began loving
the movie, and what do studio heads do when they see a movie that grosses
so high? Produce a sequel of course!
What got me worried about Mortal Kombat: Annihilation was that there was no
press showing before the movie was released, meaning that the all the local
papers were not able to review the movie. This usually means only one
thing: the studio heads want this movie to make lots of money based on
namesake but they themselves have found that the movie was so bad that they
though it would harbor lots of bad reviews -- which might spoil opening
weekend grosses.
My fears were, unfortunately, proven correct. Mortal Kombat: Annihilation
is a horrible movie in which the plot plays out like a teen-ager with a
pocket full of quarters. The story is paper thin -- the gateways to some
evil world is opened up again and bad guys come to Earth to try to steal
the planet for reasons unknown, a group of fighters must fight the bad guys
to win back Earth. The movie moves from one fight scene to another taking
no breaks. At the length that the movie runs, after the first few fights I
was numb to the uniqueness of the heavily choreographed fighting. The
fighting scenes are hampered by some pretty bad special effects. Blue
screen effects standout like a sore thumb.
For the price of admission a Mortal Kombat fan could play a few games of
Mortal Kombat and have more fun than this painful piece of film. This film
should be skipped both on the big screen and on video. This is a horrible
attempt at trying to milk a pretty good original movie. Stay far away from
this one.

Review for Fresh (1994)
Fresh is one of those films that overwhelms a person not with spectacular
gunfights, special effects, or fanciful car chases, but with strong
characters and a story that will draw you in.  The brilliance of this film
lies in the character portrayed by Sean Nelson.
Fresh (Sean Nelson) is a young drug runner for a local drug distributor,
Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito).  He lives in a poverty struck ghetto where
nothing is right.  Fresh is not your stereotypical street hood.  He is an
exceptionally intelligent young man who knows what's right and what's
wrong.  He only runs drugs for the Esteban to earn money  he looks down
upon the drug users, which include his sister.  Fresh's father (Samuel L.
Jackson) is a drunk who lives in an old mobile home and plays games of
speed chess at a local park to earn money for his booze.  Fresh doesn't
live with his father though; he lives with the saintly Aunt Frances.  He
often visits the park to play chess with his father  a sort of bonding
experience for the two, and an excellent way to draw the analogy of chess
and real life.
Although chess seems like just something that the father and son do
together, in Fresh it is more than that.  The strategies that Fresh learn
from his father are used by Fresh in real life.  When two of Fresh's
friends are gunned down, Fresh plans revenge (and rescue of his sister) in
a sort of way that will leave you breathless.
The star of this film is Sean Nelson who plays Fresh as a quiet withheld
young man who, unlike his best friend Chuckie, keeps everything to himself.
 And although Fresh doesn't say much, we can see that there is something
going on inside of his head.  Nelson's performance is brilliant.
I've been a fan of Samuel L. Jackson for a while now.  He is one of the
best actors in Hollywood, no questions asked.  And in Fresh he doesn't
break from this.  His portrayal as the hard-nosed father who teaches his
son life's lessons via chess is one of his best.  Though his screen time is
limited, he has enough screen presence to be one of the most memorable
characters in the film.
Fresh was written and directed by Boaz Yakin whose credits include The
Rookie and The Punisher.  Fresh is quite an impressive film from Yakin.
His instinct about the characters is right on and his script is smart and
doesn't take insult the viewer's intelligence.
When looking at the film description on paper, one would probably instantly
say that the film look and score is going to be dark, gritty, and angry.
Someone who thought that would be all wrong.  The film's look is bright and
clear.  Instead of going with a docu-drama grainy look, cinematographer
Adam Holender uses a higher-grade stock of film, which results in a picture
that looks optimistic.  The score by Stewart Copeland fits the movie
perfectly and is not dark at all.  Although not upbeat, the score is well
done.  There is no hardcore rap nor heavy beats, just Copeland's score,
which is brilliant.
Don't Miss Fresh.  You can find this film on video.  This is a film that is
a prime example of a great film driven by characters not by superficial
things such a special effects or action.  This film is so intricate that it
cries out to be watched once or twice before truly understanding  the
complex relationships that are setup by the script.
 a guy with a helluva attitude who loves the cinema.
 i'm your hard boiled movie guide.

Title
Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
GoldenEye was just a Bond rehearsal for Pierce Brosnan. Tomorrow Never Dies
is the Bond performance. Brosnan was a tiny bit wooden in GoldenEye,
understandably so, because the whole James Bond franchise was resting on
his shoulders alone. He proved to us that he could be Bond in GoldenEye and
in Tomorrow Never Dies, he proves to us that he is Bond.
I haven't been a long time Bond fan and have definitely not seen all 18 of
the Bond films, but I've seen my share of them. One or two Sean Connery and
Roger Moore Bonds, all of the Timothy Dalton Bonds, and, now, both Pierce
Brosnan Bonds. If you're wondering, I think that Connery is the best Bond
with Brosnan coming in a very close second (and Dalton being one of the
worst Bonds). What I like about the Bond movies is that they never change.
This I find as a good thing in the Bond franchise because it lets me walk
into a Bond movie not expecting too much from the plot and just relaxing
and enjoying the action, cool gadgets and Bond girls. This is the driving
force behind the Bond franchise, the ability to let people just come and
have fun at a movie without the need or worry of following a twisting and
turning plot line. (In some cases this is the weakness of Bond films, for
some of them don't have enough fun, action, and gadgets to fill in for the
plot.)
Tomorrow Never Dies has a fascinating amount of action, a large dose of
cool gadgets, and not one, but two Bond girls. Not to mention a pretty cool
maniacal evil man and a cool just-as-maniacal evil henchman to go with the
evil man.
The plot is pretty simple.  A crazed power hungry media mogul, Elliot
Carver -- played brilliantly by Infiniti's spokesperson Jonathan Pryce --
wants to launch a new satellite broadcast network.  He wants the launch of
this network to start with a bang and what better way to start out a news
network than a world war?  Carver devises a way to get the British and
Chinese fighting and with this he creates tomorrow's news today.  Who do we
have to stop this crazed media mogul?  Bond, James Bond, of course!
What is fascinating about this 18th installment into the Bond franchise is
the introduction of a Bond girl that can resist Bond's every  sly come-on
and also has enough umph in her to kick both the bad guys and Bond around.
Michelle Yeoh, whom we last saw in SuperCop with Jackie Chan, is this cool
Bond girl.  She plays Wai Lin, a female Chinese version of Bond working for
the Chinese government trying to avert the world war.  Yeoh steals every
scene that she's in, even the ones she shares with Brosnan.  She is, so
far, the only Bond girl that I would like to return for another installment
in the Bond franchise.
The other Bond girl is the less vivacious and the obvious weak link in this
Bond installment, and that is Teri Hatcher as Paris Carver, the former love
interest of Bond who is now married to the media mogul.  Hatcher gives a
bland and wooden performance in Tomorrow Never Dies.  And it looks as if
her part was cut a bit short because of her pregnancy which occurred early
on during the filming of Tomorrow Never Dies.
Jonathan Pryce is absolutely fantastic as Elliot Carver, the egomaniac on
drugs of sorts.  His performance has to been seen!  And his quiet henchman,
Stamper (Gotz Otto), is tough looking and a good match for Bond.
So, how's the action?  You may be wondering.  Perfect, I would have to
reply.  The opening sequence was a bit on the weak side compared to some of
the other Bond films (even to the opening sequence of GoldenEye), but it is
an exciting opening for the movie.  The action sequences are great.  Two of
them stick out in my mind.  One is a car chase through a parking structure
with James Bond driving his new BMW 750 from the back seat.  His car is
just cool, featuring all kinds of anti-theft devices and
anti-bad-guys-in-car devices.  The other is the motorcycle sequence in
which Bond and Lin try to escape from a killer helicopter while on a BMW
(can you say BMW product placement?) motorcycle and while also handcuffed
together.
There was something about this film that I really liked as an addition and
that was the humor.  There was a heavy dose of self-mocking and also
general humor in this Bond installment and that made the film feel more
relaxed and homely feeling, which I think was a good thing.  I found myself
chuckling and laughing out loud in many places during the film.
Director Roger Spottiswoode (Air America, Turner & Hooch) does a good job
with his directorial duties keeping the movie moving along at a quick pace.
 He also handled the conventional action sequences well, though I think he
grossly mishandled the martial arts sequences with Michelle Yeoh.
Worth mentioning is the fantastic musical score by David Arnold.  His score
fits the movie very well and is well suited in all of the scenes.  I at
first cringed when I heard that he was going to be scoring this film
because I thought is score for Independence Day was too over-the-top and
melodramatic, but Arnold does a great job with the score for Tomorrow Never
Dies.  The title song though does not fair as well.  Sheryl Crow was flat
and boring during this title song and the song is wholly forgettable.
Tomorrow Never Dies is good installment of the Bond franchise and is
definitely a Don't Miss  film.  The mix of the familiar Bond character,
action, cool gadgets, and humor makes for a good and fun movie.  Look for
great performances from Jonathan Pryce and Michelle Yeoh.  And don't
forgetshaken, not stirred.

Review for Jing cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha (1992)
Jackie Chan does all his stunts. That's something hard to say about action
"heroes" lately who rely on stunt doubles. SuperCop is actually the third
film in the Police Story series. But, that does not make it a requirement
to see the first two before seeing SuperCop. SuperCop is a self-contained
film.
Jackie plays Kevin Chan, a supercop in Hong Kong. He is talked into a
mission to stop a large drug lord in Hong Kong. But the assignment first
takes him to China, where he meets the Chief of Security, played by
Michelle Khan. The story, though flimsy, is not what one would go to see at
a Jackie Chan film. And indeed, From here, the story slows down and the
action takes over. And it is not just action, there is comedy interleaved
in the action too, to relieve tension.
There are two hugely memorable action sequences in SuperCop. One takes
place in a drug lord's camp and the other takes place in Malaysia. The one
in Malaysia has Jackie hanging from a rope ladder, which is attached to a
helicopter flying over the city of Kuala Lumpur.
Another different sequence shows off the humor that Jackie performs. And
this is in the earlier portion of the film at a Chinese Special Forces
Training Camp.
Jackie shows that it is possible for an action hero to be brave enough to
do their own stunts, be funny, and likeable.
SuperCop is pure action and should be seen. Don't leave after the movie
finishes at the end of ever Jackie Chan movie there are outtakes and
SuperCop is no different. There are more laughs in the outtakes than there
are in a good sitcom. You can also see how dangerous the stunts get. It's
not a Jackie fikm unless there is someone being taking away in a stretcher.
And after you watch SuperCop, see First Strike, whish is Police Story 4.

Title
Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)
L.A. Confidential is what Lee Tamahori's 1996 Mulholland Falls should have
been. L.A. Confidential is a tight and well-written film about a group of
men, some cops, that all lead a ring of corruption.
L.A. Confidential follows three cops. The three cops are completely
different from each other. Two start off as enemies but end up working
together and saving each other. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a crooked
cop who has forgotten why he's become a cop. He earns extra cash giving
information to Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito) who is the publisher of a trashy
magazine Hush-Hush. Vincennes is also the advisor for a cop TV show. Ed
Exley (Guy Pearce) is a straight cop who does everything by the book. He's
also a good politician and knows how to get what he wants out of his
department. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a cop haunted by his past and is
now taking every chance to try to correct what happened in the past, fully
knowing that he can't.
L.A. Confidential takes it's full two and half-hours to create its
wonderfully layered story. Sitting through the first hour I wondered what
the real conflict was. This was not because the script was unclear, but
because there are so many threads of story spun up in the first hour that I
was unable to figure out how they can all come together. As the film moved
into its second hour all the threads that were started in the first hour
start to tie together, and I was pulled into L.A. Confidential's engrossing
tale of corrupt cops.
L.A. Confidential is an adaptation of James Ellroy's book by Curtis Hanson
and Brian Helgeland. The script is the best thing about L.A. Confidential.
It is a tight script, that with the great direction from Curtis Hanson (The
Hand That Rocks the Cradle, The River Wild), winds its way through the two
and half-hours without losing the audience's attention. 
L.A. Confidential has a gritty look to it, which Hanson uses to build a
wonderfully dark atmosphere. But, unlike other movies, which depend on
atmosphere to carry them, L.A. Confidential shows that it can out do them
and have a tight script, genuine acting, and atmosphere.
If the script is the driving force of the film then the three leads carry
the film. All three are great. Spacey, like always, is a strange character
that one cannot really grasp what is going on in his head while watching
what his is doing. Spacey has a wonderful screen presence that is both
intense and relaxed. Pearce does a good job with his role but is not much
to write home about. The real great performance in L.A. Confidential is
Crowe's. Crowe who has starred in smaller films, and was really unknown to
me until L.A. Confidential, steals every scene that he is in. His tough guy
cop is an immensely likable guy and though he uses some strong-arming to
get what he wants from the criminals, we always know that he's doing it for
the good of L.A. and we can agree with what he does. Crowe does a good job
at switching between his calm-guy to mean-guy demeanor and he is the one to
watch for when you see L.A. Confidential.
Worth mentioning is James Cromwell (Babe, Star Trek: First Contact) who was
so nice and enjoyable in Star Trek: First Contact, but here in L.A.
Confidential he is a different man. A man filled with hate and evil, and
when you look into his eyes as he portrays Captain Dudley Smith, it gives
you a shiver.
Also worth mentioning is Jerry Goldsmith's score for the film. Goldsmith's
score is so well done that it is there but not distracting from the action
on the screen. And it is also worth mentioning that this is, so far,
Goldsmith's third score of 1997.
L.A. Confidential is a great film about corrupt cops. It's too bad that
L.A. Confidential hasn't had much advertising behind it. This is a great
film and is a pleasant surprise for me. It has a first hour that spins up
many threads of plot that eventually tie up into a tight cohesive story.
The build up for the story is long but the pay-off is well worth it. Don't
miss L.A. Confidential in the theatres.

Review for Empire Strikes Back, The (1980)
THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK SPECIAL EDITION (1997)
The Empire Strikes Back is the middle child of the Star Wars Trilogy. It is
darkest of the three and, for me, the best of the Trilogy.
The Empire Strikes Back introduces us to two new characters:  Lando
Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and the immanently smart Jedi Master Yoda
(voiced by Frank Oz).  My favourite, as all my friends know, is Yoda.  Yoda
serves as the voice of the Trilogy creator George Lucas and he has many
things to say and teach both Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and us.  Many of
the most memorable lines from the Star Wars Trilogy come from The Empire
Strikes Back and from Yoda.  (My favourite is "Try not. Do... or do not.
There is no try.")
I find ESB my favourite of the Trilogy because it has a good mix of action
and adventure.  This along with all the intelligence of Yoda makes for a
movie that I love to watch over and over again.  From the opening Hoth snow
battle to the escape through an asteroid belt and to the final lightsaber
duel, ESB is a joy to watch.
The updates for the special edition include some new views of Cloud City,
extra footage of Darth Vader, and some really pumped up sound.  The sound
is the thing that makes the biggest difference between seeing the original
version and the Special Edition version.  Star Destroyers now not only
cruise from back to front, they rumble from back to front.  The extra
allowances in the fidelity of today's audio equipment make for some pretty
exciting enhancements throughout the film.
I am glad that Lucas decided to leave in most of the original special
effects, instead of running rampant throughout the film and replacing them
with digital effects.  Lucas shows restraint and really only adds little
bits here and there to the special effects of the original.  Which I thank
him for because the original special effects are still quite impressive.
John Williams again scores this film and the score is like all of Williams'
other scores -- brilliant.  The best of the new score is "The Imperial
March" which is Darth Vader's theme, something that brings a feeling of
dread when you hear it.  Irvin Kershner does a great job taking over the
director's reign with The Empire Strikes Back.  He does not lose any of the
pacing set by George Lucas.
My favourite character of the whole Trilogy is Yoda.  Full of good advice
and intelligence, Frank Oz has created a creature that is the best addition
to the whole Trilogy.  And for The Empire Strikes Back Yoda is the best
actor of the film.  Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill have
settled in to their respective roles quite nicely.  The ever quibbling
C-3PO and R2-D2 are again in the film for some comic relief, which I loved.
ESB shows, more than Star Wars: A New Hope, how it is not the special
effects that make a movie, but the characters, story, and pure fun of the
adventure that makes the movie.  ESB pulls us into the tight circle of
characters and their adventures.  We follow Luke on his adventure to
Degobah to train with the Jedi Master Yoda while we cheer and bite our
nails as we follow Han, Leia, and C3-PO while they try to escape from the
Empire.  There is much for modern day Hollywood to learn from the Star Wars
Trilogy.
Don't Miss The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition.  I would recommend the
Special Edition of The Empire Strikes Back over the original for the sole
reason that it sounds so much better.  And be sure to see it wide screen --
if it's still running in a second run theatre catch it there, if not, get
the letterbox VHS release or the Special Edition Laserdisc collection.

Review for Face/Off (1997)
Just when you're sick of those loud and dumb summer action movies, there
comes one that proves that they are not all the same. The film is Face/Off,
and it is directed by the world acclaimed action director, John Woo.
I've admired John Woo mainly for his two Hong Kong works: Hard-Boiled and
The Killer. After I saw those two movies, I was convinced that Woo was the
ultimate action movie director. As much as I liked those films, though,
none of his American films has yet to generate such admiration, until now.
Hard Target was entertaining, but it didn't feel like an actual Woo movie.
Broken Arrow was better than Hard Target, but it still did not have that
Woo touch.
What is the Woo touch? In most action movies, you'll find an infallible
unfeeling hero who is nothing but good. Then you'll find his adversary, the
evil bug-eyed crazed madman. It's a simple game of good versus bad, no
in-between, no real character development. And, for most summer moviegoers,
character development is not the selling strong point of a summer movie. It
seems that more and more the summer films are getting worse at creating
real characters. The explanation for this is simple; not having character
development can allow for two hours full of action. What Woo does is create
a movie that is full of action but includes characters that are fully
fleshed out. His films have characters that think, feel, and are not afraid
to cry. The themes that he works with are still of good versus bad, but he
takes that theme to a new level. Woo adds gray area to the usual black and
white, good versus bad, action genre.
The other thing that Woo does is choreograph action scenes like nobody
else. Many try to copy his style, but none have achieved it. His action
scenes are agile and flowing like a ballet, and are hard to describe unless
they are seen.
In Face/Off, the two characters, though tagged good and bad, are not what
they seem. And a third of the way into the film, they truly are not who
they seem.
Sean Archer (John Travolta) is an FBI agent that has been chasing
terrorist, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), for many years now. Archer is
obsessed with catching Castor. This obsession stems from Castor
accidentally killing Archer's son. As Castor is leaving L.A., Archer gets
his chance to capture him. But instead of being captured, Castor ends up in
a coma after a large and violent gunfight and his brother Pollox is put
into prison. Archer finds out is that Castor and Pollox have planted a
large bomb somewhere in L.A., and it is going to go off soon. Pollox is a
paranoid delusional man and will not talk to anyone but his brother about
the location of the bomb. The only way to get Pollox to talk is to have
Castor talk to him, but of course Castor is in a deep coma. The solution
--and you'll have to suspend your disbelief for a moment-- is to take
Castor's face and plant it on Archer. Archer is unwilling to do it at
first, but agrees after some convincing. He takes Castor's face, is altered
to sound like Castor, and is sent into prison to try to find out the
location of the bomb from Pollox. While Archer is in jail talking to
Pollox, Castor wakes up from his coma and takes the only face that he can
find, Archer's. Castor kills everyone that knows about the plan to put the
face of Castor on Archer.
This twist gives John Woo the freedom to explore the theme of good versus
bad. Are you truly what you are inside? Or is it how you look? Or is it
your reputation? And what can you get away with while looking like someone
else? This leads both Archer and Castor to re-evaluate who they are and
what they believe in. That's a lot of drama for an action film, but it does
not bog it down a bit.
Archer, with the face of Castor, escapes prison and wants to put his life
back together, but no one knows of the plot to change his face. It is hard
for Archer because he ends up having to deal with the people that he fought
so hard against as an FBI agent, Castor's cohorts. He begins, though, to
see that the other side is not so bad at heart, and softens up a bit.
John Travolta gives a solid performance as both Archer and Castor. But it
is really Nicolas Cage who carries the film. Cage's performance as Castor
is, to say the least, maniacal. When he switches over to portraying Archer,
he completely changes his performance and tones everything down. Travolta,
though solid, does not give that feeling that he's someone else after the
face change. His performance feels mostly as if he were himself all the
time. But there are times when Travolta just unleashes, and those are his
stand out moments. The switching of faces also allows both actors to poke
fun at themselves, including Travolta, as Castor, saying to Pollox, "This
nose, this hair, this ridiculous chin!"
Woo fills this film with powerful imagery. One moment that remains in my
mind is that of Castor getting out of his car, and his coat blowing in the
wind. Once you see it, you'll be entranced by how powerful that one short
sequence is. Another scene that is quite memorable happens halfway into the
film. With the two main characters wearing each other's face, they come to
a standoff. Castor and Archer are standing opposite each other with guns
drawn. But, between them is a decorative double mirror. As Archer looks
into the mirror he sees himself with Castor's face. And on the other side
Castor looks at himself with Archer's face. All the sudden there is silence
and a realization by both characters that this is their chance to kill each
other. The image they face is of the person they want to kill, but on the
other side both know that it is an image of themselves.
This imagery goes further into the action sequences. Woo uses quick cuts
and odd camera angles to capture the action and the urgency. What Woo does
not resort to, and what most new action directors overuse, is the
unnecessary camera jiggling and shaking. Woo captures all of the action in
without having to use such a technique, which usually disorients and makes
sick more than it does capture the urgency of an action film.
Kudos to Mike Werb and Michael Colleary for putting together this wonderful
script. Though originally set in the not-so-distant future -- which makes
the face swapping a bit easier to swallow -- Werb and Colleary have adapted
the script well to Woo's request to set the story in the present.
Worth mentioning is John Powell's score for the film. It is reminiscent of
some scores done by Hans Zimmer, but it stands by itself. And it fits the
images on screen hand-in-glove. The opening theme with the images shown are
the perfect pairing of image and music. And the theme that Powell creates
for Castor Troy is unforgettable -- listen for it as Castor makes his big
entrance into the film at the airport.
Woo is one of the last true action directors. So, if you're sick of walking
into another theatre with the feeling that you'll be subjected to a loud
and dumb action film, don't worry. Go see Face/Off, which proves that an
action film just doesn't have to be loud and dumb; it can have a story and
characters that you'll care for. The violence is over the top, but is done
so well that it is almost poetic. If this is the first film of John Woo's
that you've seen, you'll find it amazing. If you're recovering from his
last two American outings, you'll be glad to hear that this film is right
on track with his Hong Kong films.

Review for Independence Day (1996)
Well, what can you say about a film brought to you by Roland Emmerich and
Dean Devlin, the "creative" team behind Stargate? Not much.  They bring
more uninspired sci-fi that is not more than a derivative of many original
films before it. To say the least, Independence Day is an overly long
special effects driven summer movie. Is that bad? In some cases no, and for
a while, it looked as if Independence Day was going to be good.
Independence Day is the textbook example of a special effects and media
hype driven movie. The story is almost quick and easy, aliens come to
Earth, they don't want to make friends and share in knowledge, they want to
destroy us and mine our planet for all its got. If Emmerich and Devlin
could have make the movie with such a short sweet premise and then driven
that with special effects, Independence Day would have turned out OK. But,
Emmerich and Devlin chose to add to the story. Adding to the story a large
set of two-dimensional characters and their stock cliched lives. And then
on top of that, to make Americans happy, they sprinkle on some hurrah for
the audiences in the US. This puts a tremendous weight on the film, and
halfway through the film, the weight starts to crush the film.
Independence Day starts off well with the song "It's the End of the World."
 And then gets even better with the alien attack.  But, after the attack,
the film starts to strain. And for the next forty some odd minutes, it
almost seems as if the film has come to a complete halt.  The ending is
exciting enough, but it is not a good enough pay off for the slow
midsection of the film.
I admit, I had a bit of silly fun when I saw the film, and I even own the
film on laserdisc. But, it is that center of mass in this film that crushes
the film. Independence Day runs two hours and twenty-five minutes, the film
could have easily been edited down to two hours or even an hour and a half,
but Emmerich and Devlin push on and try to tell a few love stories in
between. The special effects are there, and they are satisfying to a point,
but some of the effects look very retro in comparison to some of the
current crop of special effects.  The aliens look different enough from any
other movie alien, but the question is, how do those guys stand on those
small feet?  The aliens in here are scary, but they are not as scary as
Giger's Alien from the Alien Trilogy.  The spacecraft?  Cute, but mostly
uninspired, the mother ship is a blob, and the small fighter ships are
smaller blobs.
The biggest joy of the movie is Will Smith, who currently is still
protecting Earth from aliens in the more enjoyable Men In Black. Smith
gives as good as a performance he can with the limited role he is given.
Judd Hirsch gives a wonderfully funny performance as Goldblum's father.
And the last, though strangely morbid, joy of the film is the destruction
sequence that was shown oh-so-much during the trailers.
Pullman also does a decent job as the President of the United States, but
he looks a bit young for that position. As for the other supporting roles
they include the following. Vivica Fox as a stripper that Smith's character
is going to marry. Randy Quaid as a, get this, drunken pilot, and Quaid
highly overplays his part. Robert Loggia plays a stiff General. Mary
McDonnell gets to play First Lady.  Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek The
Next Generation) makes a guest appearance as a scientist working at Area
51.  There are about another half a dozen other speaking roles in
Independence Day.  With this many speaking roles, you can see how
characters can easily be turned into two-dimensional characters.  Had a few
of these characters been consolidated into a more three-dimensional and
interesting character, it would have made the movie better.
I can make a long list of gripes I have with the movie, but I won't (though
if you really want, email me).  See the movie and you can see why I have a
long list of gripes.  Sure, this is supposed to be a loud, dumb, explosive
summer film, but Emmerich and Devlin have taken the dumb part to an
extreme.  I think that in some cases they have taken it to an extreme to
inject some humor, but in other cases, as with the ending, they have just
taken it to the extreme.  This leaves the audience asking themselves, "How
dumb do you think we are?"
Is Independence Day fun?  Yes, to an extent.  The first third is fun.  The
last third is fun.  The midsection is atrocious.  Now that Independence Day
is out on video, rent it and try it out.  And be glad that your VCR can
fast-forward, because skipping the midsection is almost necessary to enjoy
the film.  Emmerich and Devlin's next "creative" outing will be next
summers' Godzilla, let's hope that somewhere between the release of
Independence Day and the editing of Godzilla that they have learned to cut
a faster moving, tighter, and a little bit smarter movie.  But, I doubt
this, for Independence Day had made a boatload of money because of early
media hype, which afterwards the film did not live up to.  Godzilla
previews have now started, and the media machine is turning, lets see if
Emmerich and Devlin can churn out something worthy of the massive media
hype this time.

Review for Affliction (1997)
Affliction takes a man with a messed up life and tears it to shreds. 
>From the opening of Affliction you know that this is not a Hollywood-type
film. The mellow opening with its seemingly still pictures of a quiet town
is a masterful way of settling the audience into the groove of the film.
And it also serves to start the film off on a happy note  a note that
doesn't last long in Affliction. As the film goes on, we hear an eerie
narration done by Willem Dafoe. 
Rolfe Whitehouse (Willem Dafoe) narrates and speaks about his brother, Wade
(Nick Nolte), who is the policeman in a small town. Rolfe lives in Boston
and is not the main character of Affliction. Wade is the focus of the film.
Wade is a loser, plain and simple. He's a man who's taken all the wrong
turns in life  many times taking the wrong turns twice. Wade and Rolfe
grew up as abused kids -- taking both verbal and physical abuse from their
father (James Coburn). Wade was more affected than Rolfe.
Wade's troubles include a job he hates, a daughter from his divorce that
hates him, and a dad who lives too close and is still quite abusive. Wade
does have better parts in his life, like his girlfriend Margie (Sissy
Spacek). As the film moves on, the troubles start to compound on Wade. The
flashpoint of the trouble start when Wade's friend Jack takes a rich man
out deer hunting. Something goes wrong and the rich man is killed. Jack
says it was an accident, Wade thinks different.
Though the death is the flashpoint, it is not the focus of the film. The
film concentrates on the characters. Wade being the biggest of them and
later on in the film Wade's dad is added. These two characters are so well
written that the film would have been engrossing even with out the hunting
accident. What we see is that abuse comes in vicious cycles  as we can see
how the cycle goes from Wade's father to Wade.
I'm not accustomed to seeing Nolte in dramatic roles, so it took me a
little to get used to him as Wade. But, once I accepted him as Wade,
Nolte's performance was brilliant. Nolte was able to make me sympathetic to
him throughout the film  which at points was hard since as the film
progresses, his character becomes more and more withdrawn from reality. The
character of Wade is what characters in Hollywood should be like. Fleshed
out and well-written, Wade shows that a movie doesn't have to rely solely
on special effects to be engaging.
Coburn as Wade's father is one of the scariest, most unpredictable
characters in the film  and in recent memory. Coburn turns in a
wonderfully textured performance as Wade's father.
The one small thing that felt out of place in Affliction was a short car
chase in the middle of the film. Is it some sort of requirement to have a
chase in every movie? But, this is a small shortcoming when looking at the
film as a whole.
The script by Paul Schrader is wonderful in its characterizations.
Schrader, working off of Russell Banks' novel, gives us characters that we
can follow and feel for. Schrader has put together a film that studies the
lives of many people and shows us what consequences come from their
actions. He humanizes Wade, a man who is spiraling down to an unknown point.
Affliction is not a happy film. It is depressing and gloomy by the end.
But, at the end we come to understand what it is like to be a man who has
made all the wrong turns in life and ends up at a point where there's no
turning back. Director/writer Paul Schrader has put together a character
study that will haunt the audience. Kudos to Schrader for not putting
together a Hollywood-type happy film and going his own way while making
Affliction. I read in an article where James Coburn says that Affliction
will not be a film that will have people lining up to see it. I agree that
this film with its limited distribution will not have people lining up to
see it. But, Affliction is a Don't Miss film. If you miss Affliction in the
theatres, Don't Miss it on video.

Review for Peacemaker, The (1997)
The Peacemaker is going to be scrutinized because of it being the first
release out of the much-touted DreamWorks SKG production company. Can
director Mimi Leder ("ER") and acting dual George Clooney and Nicole Kidman
make this be a great debut film for DreamWorks SKG?
It's interesting to note that four big players from the hit TV show "ER"
are part of The Peacemaker production: Award winning director Mimi Leder,
executive producer John Wells, actor George Clooney, and executive producer
Steven Spielberg. With these big names attached to the film, it has to be
good, right?
A group of terrorists steal ten nuclear warheads and create an incident
with one of the warheads. Dr. Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) is the head of
the group that is looking into this incident. She requests the assistance
of someone with a specialty in this field, and that someone is Tom Devoe
(George Clooney). He's a specialist in dealing with terrorism of this type
and at also dealing with illegal arms dealers. Together, Kelly and Devoe go
hunting for the rest of the nuclear warheads. Added to this is the
political plot of a "Serbian, Bosnian, and Muslim" man, who in the script
is attempted to be humanized with a sub-plot about his family being killed
off by terrorist.
What is strange is that the opening incident is dropped quickly after its
purpose is found out. I would have really liked to see what could or would
have been done to correct that incident, but it is dropped quickly to let
the action start. Which, in the case of The Peacemaker looks like a good
thing to have done, but it would have been interesting to see what could
have happened.
The best way to describe The Peacemaker is a two-hour chase scene.
Peacemaker has locations in Italy, Bosnia, Russia and the US. The world
travel is handled well. Each site has one action scene attached to it. I
especially love the car chase in Venice that plays like grown men in bumper
cars. Most of the action, though well done, is hardly imaginative and very
uninspired. The car chase is about as creative as the action scenes get.
The opening action sequence seems to take too long for what it is meant to
show. There is also the unnecessary gore that is used throughout the film.
Mimi Leder shows that she knows how to use the camera effectively.
Sometimes too effective and making some of the camera work unneeded and
distracting. Some of her shots that use the camera in motion are just for
the hell of it, and it is more distracting that anything. About halfway
through the film, you get the sense, even if you didn't know that Leder was
a director on ER, from her camera work that she is an ER director. The
constant fluid motion of the camera is a constant reminder of the camera
work in ER. Whereas in ER the camera fluidly follows a gurney or fluidly
does a 360 around a gurney, here in The Peacemaker the camera fluidly
follows another object or fluidly does a 360 around a character. 
The performances in The Peacemaker are nothing special. Kidman does OK as
Kelly. In one scene where she cries over the loss of nine soldiers, she
sheds a tear, gets up, and makes a call about a different matter. So quick,
so fast, and so brief was her cry that we don't really get the sense that
she really cared about those soldiers. Clooney does his usual character
role. Lost are his nervous ticks from ER which makes him look more
confident, but, he's not doing anything new here. His character is
likeable, but we don't really get to know his character enough to care for
him.
Hans Zimmer does the score for this film, and this is the best thing about
the film. The score is pulse pounding and follows the action well.
The Peacemaker is an average action film that has its thrilling moments.
Though the film is a bit on the long side, it does keep a good pace. I
recommend seeing The Peacemaker, but only during a matinee showing. I hope
that Dreamworks SKG has better films lined up to release after this mildly
entertaining and easily forgettable debut.

Review for Perfect Storm, The (2000)
I affectionately call The Perfect Storm "The Perfect Snore." It's hard to 
find a movie like The Perfect Storm. It is a movie with all the makings of 
a perfect movie, but somehow it fails miserably.
In October 1991, a storm like no other kicked up in the Atlantic. Trapped 
in this storm is the boat Andrea Gail, onboard the ship is a crew of grubby 
looking men and a million odd dollars of swordfish. It's hard to say what 
bothered me about this film, since it will spoil the film, but it rests 
completely on the reliability of the story.
The first half of the film deals with meeting the crew of the Andrea Gail 
and the people around them. Meet captain Billy Tyne (George Clooney), Bobby 
Shatford (Mark Wahlberg), Dale Murphy (John C. Reilly), David Sullivan 
(William Fichtner), Bugsy Moran (John Hawkes), and Alfred Pierre (Allen 
Payne). Now that you've met the crew, meet their wives, girlfriends, and 
women they meet at the local pub. Got all of those characters down? Now 
meet the captain of the other boat, Linda Greenland (Mary Elizabeth 
Mastrantonio); the owner of the company that owns both boats, the evil Bob 
Brown (Michael Ironside); a weather forecaster who seems to get too excited 
by storms, Todd Gross (Christopher McDonald); the crew of a sailboat also 
trapped in the storm; the crew of a Coast Guard ship out to rescue 
everyone; and finally the crew of a helicopter that never seems to go down. 
Now, after an hour of watching, you have all those people in mind. What 
should you do? Throw out all of them, except the crew of the Andrea Gail - 
the others, though used throughout the film, are mostly fluff.
The second half of the film focuses on the storm. Instead of focusing on 
how the storm and the impending gloom of death are affecting the crew, 
director Wolfgang Peterson focuses on "high five moments." One after 
another, we get scenes in which a crewmember's life is put into danger. 
But, miraculously they are saved and after this miracle, all around the 
boat are high fives and cheering. After the first two, this started getting 
old.
The special effects employed in the film are a mixed bag. Some are 
incredible (seeing a little fishing boat crawling up the face of a 
multi-storied high wave is incredible) but some are just incredulous (the 
whole helicopter routine, with some funny physics to go with it, was 
laughable).
On the acting front, everyone does what they can given the amount of 
characters in the film - and the limited amount of lines each actor has. 
Clooney, who I like a lot, is believable as the captain of the doomed ship. 
Wahlberg is, well, Mark Wahlberg again. Wahlberg doesn't seem to have a 
wide range of acting skills, and though he does what he does well, I'm 
still not impressed with him as an actor. The other actors, well, they're 
all a blur. John C. Reilly and William Fichtner are put into many more 
catfights than needed. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is put into the "return 
home safely dear" role. And Diane Lane, who plays Wahlberg's wife, doesn't 
get more that what Mastrantonio gets.
My disappointment comes from seeing a cast and crew of such potential in 
such a mediocre film. First, director Wolfgang Peterson is a 
disappointment. He put together such tense and interesting films as Das 
Boot and In The Line of Fire, why couldn't he have injected some of that 
intenseness into this bland and tedious film? Second, although there is a 
fine cast onboard, there are so many characters in the script that the duty 
of each actor gets diluted. Had the film concentrated on just the crew of 
the Andrea Gail and their emotional state, it would have been an intense 
film. And lastly, the special effects by ILM are disappointing - with 
quality wavering all over the place.
The Perfect Storm can be summed up by a laughable scene with Mark Wahlberg. 
Wahlberg is floating in the sea, bobbing up and down in slow motion, he is 
doing a voice-over, and superimposed on the screen with him is Diane Lane 
smiling and waving. The silliness of this scene, when one sees it, is the 
exclamation point to a dull film. Should you see this film? Sure, if you 
have extra time, if it is a matinee showing, and most importantly, if 
you've had a good night's sleep. There's nothing even close to perfect 
about The Perfect Storm.

Review for Switchback (1997)
A hitchhiker, a guy in a Cadillac, a sheriff running for election, and a
FBI agent. A strange mix of people and for the first half of Switchback a
great character study the film spins of these people. The writer and
director, Jeb Stuart, creates a story about these four men and for the
first hour and even past that, we get to look at these characters, see what
they are doing, and get to know how they would react in different situations.
The hitchhiker, Lane (Jared Leto) is a former doctor who left his
profession to travel west. He meets up with a guy, Bob (Danny Glover), who
drives a white Cadillac that has seats upholstered with nude pinups. Bob
was a former railroad worker who is now travelling west to return his
Cadillac to a friend. These two befriend each other on this trip.
In a Texas city where elections are being held a murder just occurred. The
current sheriff Buck Olmstead (R. Lee Ermey) is tasked with solving the
case while looking good to the public. Soon arrives a lone FBI agent, Frank
La Cross (Dennis Quaid), who helps Buck with the case.
What we find out is that La Cross is working on a serial killer case that
follows closely to the murder in Olmstead's town. But, does La Cross have
an ulterior motive for his work in this case? As the movie unfolds we see
that either Lane, the hitchhiker, or Bob, the guy in the Cadillac is the
serial killer. And the serial killer has a game that he wants to play with
La Cross.
Though this sounds like another whodunit mystery film in the vein of SE7EN
or Kiss The Girls, it's not. The killer's identity is revealed a little
after halfway through the film. And from this point the movie becomes a
taut thriller.
The performances throughout the film are great. R. Lee Ermey gives the best
performance of the film, stealing all the scenes he's in. (I sat watching
Ermey wondering where I've seen him before, and if you're going to wonder
the same, I've seen him in his memorable role in SE7EN.) Quaid gives a good
performance as the tough Frank La Cross who is desperate on the trail of
the serial killer. Jared Leto is good as the doctor-hitchhiker. And Glover
is the all around happiness-guy of the film. He is the guy that smiles
throughout the film and we find trust in him.
The only part of this film that bothered me was the lead up to the end that
comes off as somewhat thrown together and feels a bit unbelievable. But,
this is not a big deal because the rest of the film is so strong. The film
runs a bit over two hours, but at no time did I find myself looking at my
watch. This film moves pretty quickly and is very enjoyable.
This is the directorial debut for Jeb Stuart who wrote Die Hard and The
Fugitive. And it is a great debut for him. This is a must see film. It is a
taut tense thriller that entertains for its running time. The performance
of R. Lee Ermey is definitely one to look for.

Title
Review for Firestorm (1998)
Wow! What a great movie -- er, made-for-TV movie. It's now nine days into 1998
and I already have a film for an entry into my Top 10 Worst Films list.
I like Howie Long, he's a good guy, very down to earth looking and congenial.
His debut acting stint, starring opposite John Travolta and Christian Slater,
in John Woo's Broken Arrow was a good one. But, it was good for the fact that
Long was not the lead in the film.
Firestorm starts out with an action sequence that overuses just about every
camera technique known to movie making. From the slow-mo shots of our heroes
running directly towards the camera to the quick zooms to a
little-girl-in-distress. The opening sequence also uses some of the most hokey
cliches; a lost child in a burning house, the parents outside trying to get in
to save the child, cars in a fire with the requisite firefighter yelling,
"Run,
there's gas in the cars! They're gonna blow!", and the all annoying slow-mo
tight shots of happy firefighters jumping up and down in joy as their
teammates
come walking out of the blaze with a child in their hands (don't forget the
crescendo of music to follow this.) Whew, and that was just the first ten
minutes of the film.
Jesse Graves (Howie Long) is a smokejumper -- one of only a few hundred
firefighters trained in the specialty of jumping into a blaze to save stranded
campers and such. What happens next takes a leap of believability; a big-time
robbery prisoner (William Forsythe) breaks out of jail with the help of four
other prisoners, their plan brings them to an arson site where they, as the
big-time robbery guy tells the others, "Will become Canadian firefighters."
The rest of the film is spent following Graves, the bad guys, and the hostage
(Suzy Amis) around. The action is cheezy, uninspired, and plain uninteresting.
The action includes Howie in a fire, Howie in a building on fire, Howie on a
bike in a fire, Howie on a bike in a fire throwing a chainsaw, and so on. The
special effects for the fire are some of the worst I've seen, especially
during
the climax.
Firestorm marks the first film directed by Oscar winning cinematographer Dean
Semler (Dances With Wolves). Unlike another cinematographer turned director,
Jan De Bont (Speed, Twister), Semler does not have the eye for action. The
action is flat and bland in this film. His cinematographer, Stephen F. Windor,
tries to spice up the action with strange camera angles and techinques, but
none of these work. And worst yet all this "unique" camera work only worsens
the action. The camera work suffers from the dreaded shakey-makes-it-urgent
camera technique. Also used are a lot of extreme close-ups of things that
could
have been shot wider and the out-of-focus-makes-it-look-cool shots.
Scott Glenn and William Forsythe are the two A-list actors in the film and
both
do horribly. Glenn seems to be walking through this part since he's already
done it once before (hint, hint.) Forsythe opens the film with a somewhat
familiar imitation of the Sean Connery character, John Mason, from The Rock.
I'm glad that the film was just a few minutes under 90 minutes long. If it had
lasted any longer I would have walked out. Firestorm is a bad film that could
have past as a made-for-TV movie, but unfortunately it made it to the big
screen. Skip this film. Personally, I enjoyed the trailers more than I did the
film. (For those of you wondering, the there was a new and longer trailer for
Michael Bay's Armageddon, one for Chow Yun-Fat's US debut film The Replacement
Killers, and one for The X-Files.)

Review for Any Given Sunday (1999)
On any given Sunday during football season living rooms across America are 
filled with cheering men, with their beers in hand and their eyes glued to 
a TV screen.  These men sit glued to their TV sets watching warriors.  What 
happens on the field is pure; it's the game of football.  What happens 
before, during, and after the game off field, well that's business and the 
aim of Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday is to show what this business is.
Any Given Sunday is an ensemble film, but the three lead roles go to Al 
Pacino, Jamie Foxx, and Cameron Diaz.  Pacino is the head coach of the 
football team.  Foxx is the puking new quarterback of the team.  And Diaz 
is the former-owner's daughter who has taken over the franchise.  The 
conflicts are a bound in this film.  Pacino's Coach D'Amato and Foxx's 
Beaman fight it out over how to play the game.  Beaman goes from third 
string quarterback all the way to first string after the aging star 
quarterback, Rooney (Dennis Quaid), is injured.  Beaman is not quite a team 
player and doesn't listen to the coach.  D'Amato and Pagniacci (Diaz) are 
at each other's throats also.  D'Amato is losing his touch with his old 
school style of coaching and Pagniacci wants more for the coach including 
more wins.
Any Given Sunday is more of a movie about what happens off the field than 
what happens on the field.  We can see this by the way the on field play is 
shot.  The games are shot in a MTV style, which makes each and every hit 
look like a train hitting a car.  The cuts are fast and furious and it 
makes the game look great  though even if you tried you couldn't even 
figure out what is happening on field.  Cameras are placed everywhere and 
this visceral style puts the audience right on the field with the 
players.  What is ironic is that the MTV style used for the football games 
is so well done that when Stone puts Beaman in an actual music video for 
the film it looks chintzy.
What happens off the field is engrossing and the film could have been cut 
maybe 15 to 20 minutes if the nicely shot but useless on field stuff was 
cut out.  We see the locker room speeches, the politics of how a team is 
made viable.  We see how players and coaches are just commodities.  The 
game as it is played professionally is pure only on the field and even at 
that it is played for the money, as we see in LL Cool J's 
character.  Endorsements are what drive the players; money from wins is 
what drives the owners.  It almost seems like there is no love for the game 
and Stone makes this quite clear.  Stone is out to make a point and the 
point is that professional football, or any professional sport, is more 
about corporate earnings than it is about the love of playing the game.
All the actors in the film do well, but most of the ensemble cast is not 
given much to do.  It can plainly be seen with the James Woods character 
who seems likes a fully developed character, but does not get enough time 
onscreen to develop.  Pacino spends his time chewing scenery, which is 
fine, that's his style.  Diaz is good.  But, the big surprise was Jaime 
Foxx.  He plays his role perfect.  He knows when to be cocky, he knows when 
to be repentant.  Foxx is perfect in this film.  I hope he ventures out and 
does more roles like this.  Kudos to Foxx for a perfect performance.
I'll admit now that I'm not a huge fan of Oliver Stone.  There is just 
something about the films that he makes that turns me off, perhaps it is 
the way he tries to shove a message down the audience's throats with each 
and every of his films.  I don't know.  But, with Any Given Sunday I was 
enthralled and entertained.  This film is highly entertaining and well 
deserves the Don't Miss endorsement.

Review for Wild Bunch, The (1969)
Not being a huge fan of the Western genre I had only one reason to watch
The Wild Bunch.  The Wild Bunch director Sam Peckinpah is one the main
influences of my favourite director John Woo.  I was not expecting much
from this western.  Lets just say that by the end of the film I found
myself completely engrossed in the film and its characters.
The Wild Bunch is a group of six bank robbers led by Pike (William Holden)
a fellow who's getting old and is looking for something else to do.  In
1913, the Wild Bunch embarks on their last robbery, but unknown to them,
the place they are robbing isn't as cash-rich as they're led to believe.
After a bloody gun battle with a band of mercenary headhunters led by a
former Wild Bunch member, Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan), the Wild Bunch
escapes.  The town that they leave is left in tatters with citizens lying
dead in the streets.
The film follows Pike and his band of robbers as they try to find one more
robbery to do before retiring.  The band of robbers finally sign up to help
a Mexican general steal weapons from a US Military train.  Not far behind
them is Thornton.  Thornton's main drive to catch Pike is that if he
doesn't do it within 30 days, he'll be sent back to jail.  Thornton cut a
deal with the devil for his freedom from prison, in order to keep his
freedom, he must led a posse of inept bounty hunters in their chase of Pike.
Peckinpah is by no means an indirect director.  In The Wild Bunch he takes
on many themes including the main one of loyalty within a group.  And it is
with his unfiltered look at this band of robbers and the bounty hunters
that we see the contrast between the two groups in their loyalty.
Peckinpah doesn't make anything light or fluffy, including the action.
The action in The Wild Bunch is amazing.  I can see exactly where Woo gets
his influence.  There are two big action set pieces in the film that show
just how brutal Peckinpah wanted the film to be.  There are no pretty
deaths in this film everything is messy.  Peckinpah uses slow motion, quick
cuts, and multiple angles to capture the sense of urgency in the action set
pieces and does it so well that I was pulled right into the film during
those minutes.  But, as much as The Wild Bunch can be seen as an action
film, it has much more than that.
Peckinpah uses many objects and people in the film to not so subtly hit
home different messages.  His use of children in the film is one of the
best examples of this.  As the film opens we are treated to the image of
children, scorpions, and ants.  This whole montage is a foreshadowing of
what will happen in the town.  And as the film continues, we see that the
children in film are changing as the Wild Bunch is also.  From good and
innocent  flinching at the deaths in the town  to remorseless and immoral
the little soldier children.
Although all of the performers in the film are brilliant, there are three
that are standout.  William Holden as Pike is the absolute best casting for
this part.  With a face that shows a sense of tiredness at what he is
doing, Holden makes Pike a likeable bank robber/murderer.  Ernest Borgnine
as `Dutch', Pike's best friend, switches from different emotions as quickly
as needed and is completely believable: watch him after Pike `helps' one of
the Wild Bunch members who is blinded during a gun fight.  But, the best
performance, though not one that gets a lot of screen time, is Robert
Ryan's as the reluctant Thornton.  Although Thornton has to keep his word
and do his job, he is reluctant to do so because he doesn't have the right
people in his band of bounty hunters and because he is still has a little
loyalty to Pike.  Ryan gives a brilliant performance as Thornton.
Released in 1969 The Wild Bunch was a violent film that created a lot of
news  I'm not old enough to know, being born in 1975, but my friend John
Higdon who saw The Wild Bunch in theatres says, `As I recall, it was the
first movie I ever saw that had guts spewing out when folks got shot.'
Viewed today, the violence is still pretty gritty and gruesome, but a bit
on the lighter side because of the purveyance of gratuitous violence in
Hollywood.  The version of The Wild Bunch that I screened was the 1995
director's cut of the film.  I have not seen the original version and could
not tell you what the differences are, but the director's cut of the film
is amazing.  Don't Miss The Wild Bunch.  You can find the director's cut of
the film on DVD.

Review for Face/Off (1997)
Just when you're sick of those stupid, loud and dumb summer action movies,
there comes one that proves that not all summer action movies are the same.
The film is Face/Off, and it is directed by, the world acclaimed action
director, John Woo.
I've admired John Woo mainly for his two Hong Kong works Hard Boiled and
The Killer. After I seen those two movies I was convinced that Woo was the
ultimate action movie director. As much as I liked those films though, none
of his American films have yet to spawn such admiration, until now. Hard
Target was entertaining, but didn't feel like it was an actual Woo movie.
Broken Arrow was better than Hard Target, but it still did not have that
Woo touch.
What is the Woo touch? In most action movies you'll find an infallible
unfeeling hero who is nothing but good. Then you'll find his adversary, the
evil bug-eyed crazed madman. A simple game of good versus bad, no in
between, no real character development. And, for most summer movies goers,
character development is not a strong point for the movie. But, as more
summers roll around, the worst films have become in even creating some
character development. The explanation for this is simple, not having
character development can allow for two hours full of action. What Woo does
is create a movie that is full of action but includes characters that are
fully fleshed out. His films have characters that think, feel, and are not
afraid to cry. The themes that he works with are still of good versus bad,
but he takes that theme to a new level. The characters are labelled as good
and bad, but it's a matter of perception on who is good and who is bad.
The other thing that Woo does is choreographing action scenes like nothing
else. Many try to copy his style, but none have achieved it. His action
scenes are as most put it like a ballad. And are hard to describe unless
they are seen.
Face/Off is one of Woo's most Hong Kong films yet. After the success of his
last film, Broken Arrow, he must have got more creative control over
Face/Off. Most noticeable is that the two characters, though tagged good
and bad, are not what they seem. And a third of the way into the film, they
truly are not who they seem.
Sean Archer (John Travolta) is a FBI agent that has been chasing a
terrorist, Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage), for many years now. Archer is
obsessed with catching Castor. This obsession stems from Castor
accidentally killing Archer's son. As Castor is leaving L.A. Archer gets
his chance to capture him. But, instead of capturing Castor, in a large and
violent gunfight, Castor is put into coma and his brother, Pollox, is put
into prison. What Archer finds out is that Castor and Pollox have planted a
large bomb somewhere in L.A., and it is ready to go off soon. Pollox is a
paranoid delusional man and will not talk to anyone else about the location
of the bomb but his brother. The only way to get Pollox to talk is to have
Castor talk to him. Castor being in a deep coma is a problem though. The
solution, this sounds strange, but works in the movie, is to take Castor's
face and plant in on Archer. Archer is unwilling to do it at first, but
agrees to do it after some convincing. Archer takes Castor's face and is
altered to sound and look like Castor, and is sent into prison to try to
fine out the location of the bomb from Pollox. While Archer is in jail
talking to Pollox, Castor wakes up from his coma and wants a face.
Obviously, Castor takes the only face that he can find, Archer's. Castor
kills everyone that knows about the plan to put Castor's face on Archer.
This twist gives John Woo the freedom to explore the theme of good versus
bad. Are you truly what you are inside? Or is it the looks? Or is it the
reputation? And what can you get away with while looking like someone else,
who is good or bad? This leads to both Archer and Castor to re-evaluate who
they really are, and what they believe in. That's a lot of drama for an
action film, but it does not bog it down a bit.
Archer, with Castor's face escapes prison and wants to put back together
his life. It is hard for Archer, who has to deal with the people that he
fought so hard against. He begins to see that the other side is not so bad
at heart, and softens up a bit.
John Travolta gives a solid performance as both Archer and Castor. But, it
is really Nicolas Cage who carries the film. Cage's performance as Castor
is, to say the least, maniacal. When he switches over to portraying Archer,
he completely changes his performance and calms everything down. Travolta,
though solid, does not give that feeling, throughout the movie, that he's
really someone else. His performance feels as if he were himself all the
time. But there are times when Travolta just unleashes, and those are his
stand out moments. The switching of faces also allows for both actors to
poke fun at themselves, including Travolta, as Castor, saying to Pollox,
"This nose, this hair, this ridiculous chin!"
Woo fills this film up with imagery that is very powerful. One that remains
in my mind is that of Castor getting out of his car, and his coat blowing
in the wind. Once you see it, you'll be entranced by how powerful that one
short sequence is. This imagery goes further into the action sequences. Woo
uses quick cuts and odd camera angles to capture the action and the
urgency. What Woo does not resort to, and what most new action directors
over use, is the unnecessary camera jiggling and shaking. Woo captures all
of the action in without having to use such a technique. This technique
usually disorients and makes sick more than it does capture the feel of an
action film. Woo is one of the last true directors that knows how to make a
real action movie. So, if you're sick of walking into another theatre
dreading the feeling that you'll just be treated to a loud and dumb action
film, don't do it. Go see Face/Off, which proves that an action film just
doesn't have to be loud and dumb, it can have a story and characters that
you'll care for. The violence is over the top, but is done so well that it
is almost poetic. If this is the first film of John Woo's that you've seen,
you'll find it amazing. If you're recovering from his last two American
outings, you'll be glad to hear that this film is right on track with his
Hong Kong films.

Review for Green Mile, The (1999)
Just when I thought Hollywood was on a slide down into mediocrity, I see a 
great film like The Green Mile that proves that there are still good movies 
that come out of Hollywood.  Lately, it seems that the good movies are the 
ones that come from independent studios, but The Green Mile shows that a 
big budget movie out of the stables of Hollywood can still be a gripping 
movie and grab a viewers emotions and drain them.
The Green Mile is like a follow-up to writer/director Frank Darabont's 
"Shawshank Redemption".  Both movies take place in about the same time and 
both movies take place in a prison.  The Green Mile is a milder movie and 
has only one little flaw that can be overlooked if one tries hard enough.
The Green Mile is a prison ward that has a floor that is a light lime 
color.  In this ward is held men who are on their last mile, they are on 
death row.  The head guard on The Green Mile is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) 
and his belief is that these prisoners should be talked to and not stressed 
during their last mile of life.  One day the biggest prisoner enters The 
Green Mile; his name is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).  As it turns 
out Coffey is in prison for the murder and rape of two young girls, but as 
we find out he's just a gentle giant.  Did Coffey commit the murders?  We 
all can guess that plot point.
Coffey though, has a special gift and it is here that we have the little 
flaw that I mentioned before.  Apparently, Coffey can take away disease 
with a touch and spit it out in a cloud of computer-generated flies.  And 
the first time we are introduced to this is long into the movie, probably 
halfway or so (and this is a three-hour movie).  With this much time 
invested in a wholesome movie that doesn't need any suspension of 
disbelief, all the sudden we as the audience are forced to change mindsets 
when that cloud of computer-generated flies comes out of Coffey's 
mouth.  It's jarring.  It doesn't by any means ruin the film, but it is 
jarring.
Both Shawshank and The Green Mile are scripts adapted by Darabont from 
Stephen King stories.  I would say that Shawshank is the better movie, but 
The Green Mile is not far behind.  With Shawshank it is a straight film 
about real people.  With The Green Mile it's a film with some need to 
suspend belief because of Coffey's supernatural gift.
I must say the cast of The Green Mile is excellent.  All of the actors do a 
wonderful job.  Hanks and Duncan give standout performances.  Both were 
convincing and were perfect for their characters.  I have to give big kudos 
to Duncan who has been doing better and better roles.  I first saw him in 
Armageddon, then in The Whole Nine Yards, and now his best role yet in The 
Green Mile.  Among the other cast members that give great performances are 
Bonnie Hunt as Edgecomb's wife; David Morse, Doug Hutchison and Barry 
Pepper as fellow guards; and Michael Jeter as Del an inmate in ward.
The script by Darabont and Darabont's direction of the film are near 
perfect.  And this film is one of the best films of 1999.  I'm sad that I 
kept procrastinating and finally missed see The Green Mile in the theatres 
and ended up seeing it on DVD.  If you were like me and missed The Green 
Mile in the theatres, don't hesitate, go rent the video or DVD right 
away.  Don't Miss The Green Mile.

Review for Mission: Impossible II (2000)
What a way to kick off the summer of 2000! If you're a Hard Boiled Movie 
Guide reader, it'll be no surprise to you that I enjoyed Mission: 
Impossible 2 because of my heavy bias towards movies made by John Woo. So, 
to get this out of the way early: Don't Miss Mission: Impossible 2. Now, if 
you want the details, read on.
Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) can be likened to being the American version of 
James Bond. If you thought the first film was convoluted and confusing, 
you're not the only one. After watching it a few times, I was finally able 
to string most of it together. If you like that kind of spy-versus-spy type 
movie, M:I-2 will disappoint you. But, if you're looking for a cohesive 
story that is punctuated by some eye-popping pyrotechnics and shoot-outs, 
you're in for a treat.
The story of M:I-2 is pure and simple. A rogue IMF Agent, Sean Ambrose 
(Dougray Scott), has stolen a deadly virus. It is up to Hunt and his 
associates to track down Ambrose and retrieve the virus before it is 
unleashed to the world. There are twists and turns all through the film, 
most of them using the (overused) masked agent trick. Assisting Hunt this 
time around are Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie 
Newton), and Billy Baird (John Polson). Doing a short and sweet cameo is 
Oscar-winner Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's unnamed new boss.
As far as the story goes, it's enough to keep a summer audience's attention 
without being overbearing. The one drawback was the predictability of the 
script, and again the overuse of the whole masked agent bit. There is one 
real audience pleasing twist in the film. This twist involves Hunt planning 
a break-in while Ambrose figures out Hunt's plans. A brilliant cutting of 
this sequence makes the sequence superb.
For me writing a review of a John Woo film is both easy and difficult. It 
is easy because all of his films entertain me, but difficult because I tend 
to rattle on like an uncontrollable fan who can't look past the name John 
Woo. The action in M:I-2 is top-notch. Woo pulls out all stops with the 
action, but the action seems to be all crammed into the end of the film, 
making the film feel heavy in the beginning with exposition and heavy at 
the end with action. The balance falls in the sense of wonder and grandeur 
that Woo puts into the film. For instance, Woo shoots a flamenco sequence 
early in the film with such flair that it stands out as more than just a 
dance sequence.
As for the actors, we're not going to a summer movie to see Oscar-caliber 
acting, and the cast knows that. All the members do a good job with their 
parts, but don't expect Tom Cruise to be putting in anything but his silly 
grin. Also take into account that M:I-2 is the first film in which Cruise 
fires a gun onscreen. Worth mentioning is Thandie Newton who is absolutely 
gorgeous onscreen and steals every scene she is in. Sadly, Ving Rhames and 
John Polson do not get much to do in the film. Rhames is relegated to 
running equipment back and forth, or sitting in a van. Polson has even less 
to do.
Final word on Mission:Impossible 2? Go see it for some summer eye-candy 
fun. Don't Miss Mission:Impossible 2.

Title
Review for Negotiator, The (1998)
Movies can be seen as bookends and the books in between. The bookends are
the opening and closing of the film and the books contain the story and
subplots of the film. Most movies have beautifully crafted bookends and
thin poorly written books. The Negotiator goes the other way. The bookends
for The Negotiator are bent out of shape and not beautiful at all. The
books that the bookends hold are tense and well written.
The Negotiator has a cliched and unbelievable opening. Danny Roman (Samuel
L. Jackson) is the best negotiator in his department. In the opening, Roman
is trying to talk a man out of killing his own daughter. Roman finally uses
some dangerous tactics to get the girl free and for this, he takes some
heat from his commanders. What we find out later, during the cliched
after-I-saved-the-day party, is that Roman's partner suspects that some of
the officers in the department are stealing money from the department.
Before Roman finds out too much from his partner, his partner is killed.
Roman is suspected of killing his partner. Though we know that he is being
framed.
What comes next is the contrived part in an instant, Roman's whole
department turns against him. They all think he's the killer. What doesn't
ring true is that from what I've seen, cops are pretty protective of each
other. What is portrayed onscreen just doesn't jive. But, this is also the
point in which the movie picks up a lot of steam. Roman takes hostages, one
being a key figure in the money stealing deal. Roman wants to force this
person to admit to what has been happening; he wants to clear his name.
Roman demands that a negotiator from outside his department do the
negotiating, and he will only talk to Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey). Jackson,
who by himself is already a great actor and a big presence on the screen,
is now joined by Kevin Spacey as the negotiator. From now on, the acting of
these two intense actors drives the movie.
One other thing drives The Negotiator. Though we think that the person that
Roman is holding hostage is maybe one of the people involved in the money
stealing scheme, we also know that there are others from Roman's department
that are part of the scheme. But who? Director F. Gary Gray and writers
James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox throw all kinds of bones out. And it isn't
until the very end that we find out who is behind all of this. I loved this
because it kept me guessing as to who was in the scheme and who wasn't.
Jackson and Spacey are from two different ends of the intense-acting
spectrum. Jackson is verbal and loudly eloquent. Spacey, on the other hand,
carries an inner intensity that radiates with his eyes and his calm
exterior. The two light up the screen. It is the dialogue between these two
that kept my attention.
The script by James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox is very knowledgeable about the
ways of negotiators. Watch for the lessons about negotiations by Roman
during the film. I loved how DeMonaco and Fox worked in a lesson on what to
say to hostage takers. Roman also talks about what to look for in order to
see that a person is lying. I think that DeMonaco and Fox did some good
research before embarking on writing this script. The script itself has a
meaty midsection that is sandwiched by a weak opening and closing.
Director F. Gary Gray keeps the movie tight and tense. Roman takes hostages
in an office in the midsection of a high rise. Gray uses the tight quarters
of this office fully. The only complaint I have is that Gray and the
writers threw in an action sequence halfway into the film that didn't feel
right. I thought that Gray and the writers were doing very well with the
negotiations between Roman and Sabian, but then all the sudden there
appears this action sequence. But, this is a small complaint. Kudos to Gray
for putting together a taut film.
The supporting actors all fare well. Look for the late J.T. Walsh in his
final performance. David Morse and John Spencer turn up good supporting
performances.
Don't let the bookends of The Negotiator fool you into thinking that it's a
raggedy movie. Don't Miss The Negotiator in the theatres. This is a solid
film that will keep you at the edge of your seat from the beginning to the
end.

Review for Life Less Ordinary, A (1997)
The team that made Trainspotting has come back and made a new film, but
since I've never seen Trainspotting I didn't know what to expect when I
stepped into the theatre to watch A Life Less Ordinary.  What I got was a
wonderfully hilarious and silly romantic, action, comedy.  This is what
Alicia Silverstone's horribly terrible Excess Baggage should have been.
God has implemented a new strategy in heaven.   Angels are sent down to
Earth to make people fall in love and if the angels are successful, they
get to return to heaven.  If not, they get to stay on Earth.  O'Reilly
(Holly Hunter) and Jackson (Delroy Lindo) are the first two angels that
this policy gets stuck on.  Their job?  Get Robert (Ewan McGregor) and
Celine (Cameron Diaz) to fall in love.  The problem is that these are two
completely different people.  Celine is a spoiled rich girl of a
millionaire and Robert is a lowly dreamer janitor for the company that
Celine's dad owns.
Robert is fired and is being replaced by a robot.  He is evicted from his
home and dumped by his girlfriend.  His life is in the toilet and he's just
about to go postal.  And he does.  He goes to threaten his ex-boss into
giving him back his job but in a chain of events ends up kidnapping the
ex-boss' daughter, Celine.
Here we follow Robert and Celine in a road-trip type film and we see that
as much as we, and the angels, want to have Robert and Celine fall in love,
some strange cosmic force seems to be pulling them apart.  This makes it
different from the typical romantic comedy where the two would
instantaneously fall in love.  The two of them go through a series of
events that lead them to fall in love together, at least we think.  One of
the problems though is that in the events that Robert and Celine go through
don't really all seem to fit together well and they feel like a bunch of
funny skits put together.  Which for A Life Less Ordinary is not that bad.
I found myself laughing out loud many times during A Life Less Ordinary.
The film definitely has its moments.  The film is tries to be quirky and
sometimes it works out very well, but other times it just seems like the
film makers are trying way too hard.
Worth mentioning is the camera work and the music.  The camera work is
different to say the least.  It is very stylistic camera work and there
were more than a few shots that I really loved seeing.  The music is also
great.  The score itself is somewhat forgettable but the music that goes
along with the film is perfect.  This includes "Beyond the Sea" which is
the love song that Robert picks for Celine in a country-western karioke bar.
The performances were all great.  I loved Holly Hunter's over-the-top
performance the most.  She is hilarious throughout the film.  The two leads
are great too, though, I would suggest a haircut for McGregor, that nappy
hair just does not work.  Cameron Diaz, who starred in one of my favorites
from this summer, My Best Friend's Wedding, goes from the perky perfect
girl in My Best Friend's Wedding to the conniving, cheating, and spoiled
daughter in A Life Less Ordinary.  And Delroy Lindoy is just fantastic as
Jackson the poetic angel.
A Life Less Ordinary is a must see movie.  It is hilarious and very
enjoyable and its two-hour showing moves along rather quickly.  When you
see A Life Less Ordinary look for the exceptionally funny scene in which
Robert demands a ransom from Celine's father.  Now that I know what the
Trainspotting team can do, I'm going to go rent Trainspotting and see how
it's like.

Review for Batman & Robin (1997)
"Bring back Tim Burton! Bring back Tim Burton!" the little voice in the
back of my head kept screaming, and this was only five minutes into Batman
& Robin. The voice got louder and louder as the movie got worse and worse.
I've always loved Batman, from the cheezy campy TV show that I watched as a
kid to the comics to the Tim Burton movies to the animated series. When
Joel Schumacher came on board with the third installment of the big screen
Batman series, I thought he made a decent attempt a directing Batman
Forever. Sure, Forever had a different look and a different -- more action
-- feel to it, but it was a fun film.
With Batman & Robin it looks like Schumacher wants to take the series back
to the old days of the Batman TV series, adding a full compliment of
campiness to it. I'm thankful he hasn't -- yet -- brought the big exploding
lettered action cards to the big screen (remember? BLAM! CRASH! ZOW!) But,
Schumacher comes pretty close to it. To say the least, Batman & Robin is
the worse of the big screen Batman series. To be even more honest, it's one
of the worst big budget movies I've seen this year.
The script by Batman Forever's Akiva Goldsman is so paper thin that I'm
hesitant to even waste time explaining it. In one sentence: Mr. Freeze and
Poison Ivy want to kill Batman, Batman and Robin want to kill each other,
and we get a new add-on rubberized suit super heroine.
How's George Clooney as the new face behind the mask?  Clooney gives an
admirable performance as Batman, and is the only actor in Batman that is
not over-the-top or sliding deep past overacting. I like Clooney as Batman
more than I did Kilmer, but I still think that Michael Keaton is the real
Batman.   Chris O'Donnell is annoying as the annoying Dick Grayson/Robin.
Arnold Schwarzenegger must have been paid a lot of money to throw his
reputation on this awful movie.  He gives the worse performance of the
whole cast of big name stars.  His overacting is unbearable.  Uma Thurman
does a bit better than Arnold Schwarzenegger, but not by much.  And Alicia
Silverstone looks like she can barely fit into that kinky rubbersuit.
As for Clooney, of the three action films that I've seen of his -- Batman &
Robin, The Peacemaker, and From Dusk Till Dawn -- this is the worse film of
his action career.  He's a good actor, and he really deserves better that
any of his previous action films.  If you want to see Clooney in a somewhat
decent action movie, try The Peacemaker.
Schumacher has brought the whole Batman series to its lowest point with
this film.  And with rumors of another film in the series, I have only one
piece of advice for the studios, "Bring back Tim Burton!  Bring back Tim
Burton!"  As much as I like Clooney as Batman, at this point just about
anyone can be Batman.  Burton's Batman was a dark man living in a dark
world.  Schumacher's Batman is a cardboard cutout comic character running
around like a headless chicken in a comic book world.
Batman & Robin is just plain awful.  Save your money.  Miss it, Miss it,
Miss it.  I'm sorry I spent the two hours watching this film.  The only
thing that carried me on watching was to see how much worse the film could
get.  And after the first few minutes when the film starts to go down hill,
the hill becomes intangibly more steep as each passing minute comes along.
This film is not fun it's just painful.  Save yourself from the pain.

Review for Edge, The (1997)
The Edge is a beautifully photographed action thriller. There are two
strings of plot that run through the film, the biggest of them is of
survival. The other is about being rich. Who can you trust if you were a
multi-millionaire? Do people talk to you only because you're rich? Did that
pretty model marry because of your money? Life seems rough when you're rich.
The Edge follows the life of a multimillionaire, Charles Morse (Anthony
Hopkins), who is on a trip to the wilderness because his model wife has a
photo shoot with photographer Robert Green (Alec Baldwin). After the shoot
with Charles' wife, Robert wants to go find an old Indian bear hunter for
another shoot. Before going of to find the Indian, he invites Charles
along, and Charles agrees. They fly out to find the Indian, but catastrophe
happens and the plane crashes. Charles is an avid reader and has all sorts
of knowledge stored up in his head, including enough knowledge to help get
Robert, Stephen (Harold Perrineau Jr., who plays Robert's assistant), and
himself out of the wilderness.
The Edge starts out a little slow, but quickly picks up pace when a
specific character is introduced. This amazing character would be the
man-eating bear (Bart the bear) that is stalking Robert, Charles and
Stephen. Whenever the story gets a little slow, Bart the bear is called in
to help quicken the pace. And that he does just that. Bart the bear creates
some genuinely frightening and white knuckled moments.
There is a plot thread about Robert having an affair with Charles' wife,
and planning to kill Charles so that he can get both the woman and the
money. This plot thread is introduced early on in the film, but is left to
smoulder while Bart the bear thrills us. But, as I thought that the plot
thread was merely dropped it shows up again, and provides some good tension
between Robert and Charles.
The Edge is beautifully photographed, and there has to be lots of kudos
given to the cinematographer, Donald McAlpine. He captures the beauty of
the wilderness and never misses a chance to put in more. The film is
beautiful. Lee Tamahori (Mulholland Falls) does a great job at keeping the
pace of the movie quick and crisp. Though the beginning is a little slow,
he manages to move past it rather well. Tamahori handles the action
sequences very well, and is able to create some high tension during some
scenes.
The score by Jerry Goldsmith is worth mentioning also. The score fits the
movie well. The score is broad and moody just like the film. And the score
never becomes overbearing.
The two real reasons to see The Edge are for Anthony Hopkins and Bart the
bear. Hopkins gives a good multi-leveled performance. His performance is
the one that the film rides on, and he does exceptionally well. When we
look into his eyes, and listen to him state something on screen, we can
also see that he is stating something but his mind is focused on figuring
out what's ahead of that. Bart the bear is also a good reason to see The
Edge. He is mighty scary, and worth the price of admission itself.
The one person that I found as the weak link was Alec Baldwin. Maybe I'm
just used to seeing him in a more take-control part, but the whiner that he
plays in The Edge just doesn't work. He tries to be a whiner, but it never
comes off as being genuine. Baldwin hasn't had any good films lately, his
best role ever, for me, was his role as Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red
October. And though I didn't think he fit his role in The Edge, this is one
of his better and more memorable performances in the long while since The
Hunt for Red October.
The Edge is a highly entertaining movie about the survival of men in the
wilderness. It starts off slow but quickly picks up the pace. Its action is
thrilling and will keep you at the edge of your seat while its beautiful
photography will take your breath away. Hopkins is the star of the film,
and he does a great job with his role. Don't miss this film in the theatres.

Title
Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
Chow Yun-Fat is a world renowned actor from Hong Kong, largely known for
his incredible work with John Woo.  But, like all other things that are not
American, he's not known well here in the US.  The Replacement Killers aims
to change that.  But, can it?
John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat) is a hitman for hire.   Asian crime syndicate boss,
Terrance Wei (Kenneth Tsang),  wants the son of police officer Stan Zedkov
(Michael Rooker) dead.  Wei hires Lee to do the hit, but* while Lee has
cross-hairs trained on the young boy, he's unable to do the job.  John Lee
might be a killer for hire, but there are things that he cannot do.  Wei
finds this unacceptable and Wei, now gone mad, wants a lot of blood.  Wei
brings in the replacement killers.  While trying to make a run out of the
US, Lee needs the help of Meg Coburn (Mira Sorvino) who is a master
document forger.
That's as far as the story goes.  The script by Ken Sanzel is weak and
flimsy.  It's an excuse for first-time director Anton Fuqua to move from
action scene to action scene.  Chow Yun-Fat is given only a handful of
lines to perform and the rest of the film is him running around with dual
pistols.
I mentioned earlier that Chow Yun-Fat is a world renowned actor.  I stress
the word actor.  It seems like in the case of The Replacement Killers,
Hollywood has tried to boil Chow Yun-Fat down to just a typical "action
hero."  This is a sad thing to do, for Chow Yun-Fat is more than just that.
Anton Fuqua, a former music video director, tries hard to pay homage to
John Woo (who is one of the producers.)  It's unfortunate that rookie Fuqua
is unable to create the same type of action that master Woo can.  Fuqua
uses all sorts of Woo's tricks including Woo's signature slow-mo shots.
But, the feel of Fuqua's direction is purely mechanical.  And this
mechanical feeling goes all around; from actors to production crew.
Everyone seems to be "just going through the motions."
Yes, there are a lot of action sequences, but the problem is that Fuqua is
never able to inject the adrenaline into the sequences.  The sequences are
highly derivative and flat.
There were no real memorable action sequences from The Replacement Killers.
The action flies from office, to restaurants, to car washes, and to dance
clubs without any real connection to them.  I think that the movie would
have worked out if the characters weren't so one dimensional.  Mira
Sorvino's Meg is bland and we don't seem to care about her. Chow Yun-Fat's
John Lee is equally bland.  My test for bland action heroes? Easy: if the
hero gets shot in the shoulder (where most action heroes get shot) does the
audience cringe in sympathetic pain, or not?  I didn't cringe when John Lee
was shot in the shoulder.
The one redeeming quality of The Replacement Killers is the studio's
perceived big selling point of the film, Chow Yun-Fat. Though he is not
given enough to do to show how good of an actor he really is, he brings a
sort of charm and grace to his part.  It's hard to describe Chow Yun-Fat
and the way that he is onscreen.  He is suave, cool, and smooth.  And he
just looks good with two pistols in hand.  I just wish the script had more
for Chow Yun-Fat to do.
It's hard for me to recommend a mediocre action film like The Replacement
Killers.  If it had not been for the presence of the ever-cool Chow
Yun-Fat, there would be no merit to this film.  But, since this is the
first American Chow Yun-Fat film, it serves as an introduction to him for
many.  And for that reason, I lightly recommend this film.  The Replacement
Killers plays like it should logically play from a music video director, if
you really think about it. The movie feels like a ninety minute music
video.  See this film at a matinee showing or on video.
If you think that Chow Yun-Fat is cool and would like to see more of him,
check out some of these older films that he did with John Woo.  I would
recommend these Woo/Fat films:  The Killer, A Better Tomorrow, and my
ever-favourite Hard-Boiled.  These films will wow you more than The
Replacement Killers.

Title
Review for Knock Off (1998)
Just two weeks ago after I saw The Avengers, I walked out of the theatre
thinking, "Could there be any worse film than this?" After seeing
Jean-Claude Van Damme's Knock Off, a little voice in the back of my head is
screaming "Yes!"
The opening to the film is a mish-mash of non-adrenaline-pumping action. It
introduces us to the slim story line of the film There are bad guys,
Russians of course, who have miniaturized explosives to the point that they
are the size of watch batteries. The bad guys plan to put these mini-bombs
into everything, including pants, dolls, and radios. The bad guys want to
blow up the world unless the world is willing to pay to live.
The reason I went to see Knock Off was not for Van Damme, who is a complete
dolt, but because of the director Tsui Hark. Hark, who worked with John Woo
in Hong Kong, is the epitome of a Woo-knock-off. I wanted to see if Hark's
work has gotten any better than some of the stuff he's been putting out in
Hong Kong and his debut American film, Double Team. Has he gotten any
better? No. Hark continues to be a sub-par Woo-wannabe. And with this
second American film he still has one big thing working against him The
Jean-Claude Van Damme Curse.
I don't understand why some of the big Hong Kong directors making their
move to America have to be cursed with making their debut film with this
dolt Van Damme. First, John Woo made the mediocre Hard Target with Van
Damme. Then Ringo Lam made Maximum Risk. Now it's Tsui Hark, who didn't
learn with Double Team, trying again with Knock Off. Woo got off OK, but he
had to work hard to regain his status as a master filmmaker (following Hard
Target were the better Broken Arrow and Face/Off). Lam made a good effort
with Maximum Risk and has yet to come out with another film. What Hark
lacks, that both Woo and Lam have, is talent. Hark's direction in Knock Off
is hideous.
I would write about acting but there is none to be seen in Knock Off. Van
Damme can't and will probably never learn how to act. Van Damme makes me
miss Steven Seagal. Who surprised me in Knock Off was Paul Sorvino. What's
an actor like Sorvino doing in a movie like Knock Off? I guess every actor
has bills to pay. Rob Schneider is biting-aluminum-annoying in Knock Off.
Every time he was onscreen, I wanted a bad guy to take out Schneider's
character.
Knock Off shows that an action picture can be boring. I was constantly
looking at my watch during the film and felt sleepy 20 minutes into the
film. Call the ambulance; I think this film is dead. If you take anything
away from reading this review, take this message Skip Knock Off! Skip Knock
Off!

Title
Review for Crimson Tide (1995)
Taking a look at some of the movies that Tony Scott has put out (Top Gun,
Days of Thunder, The Last Boy Scout) it's hard to accept that Crimson Tide
is his movie.  It is even harder to accept that this is a Jerry Bruckheimer
and Don Simpson production.  As you look at the visual style of Crimson
Tide, it is obvious that this is a Tony Scott movie, and it is obviously a
Bruckheimer and Simpson production.  Fortunately, though the visual style
reflects the directorial and production people, the film itself does not.
Why do I say that it is hard to accept that Crimson Tide is a Tony Scott
movie initially?  Because Crimson Tide is so intelligent, so character
focused, and the action so tight.  In previous Tony Scott movies, such as
Top Gun, the action was wildly over-the-top and the characterization mere
one-dimensional.  But, this anomalous movie from Tony Scott shows that he
can do a movie that is all gloss but still filled with characters that we
care for and are truly dimensional and layered. 
Gene Hackman is Captain Frank Ramsey the captain of the nuclear submarine
Alabama.  His XO, executive officer, is out with appendicitis, and he needs
a new one.  Why?  Because his boat is about to set sail to take care of
some hostile rebels in Russia.  The new XO that Ramsey picks is Lt.
Commander Hunter, played by Denzel Washington.  These two men are almost
exact opposites.  Ramsey is a simple man that follows orders without having
to know why.  Hunter, a Harvard trained officer, wants to know why before
doing something.  This puts the men at odds when trouble arises.  And
trouble arises when they are forced to consider firing their nuclear
missiles.  And it is a broken message that puts the men at odds.  Should
they fire their missiles?  Or should they get confirmation?
Early in Crimson Tide, it boldly mentions other great sub movies as if to
taunt the audience to compare itself to them.  And, if one were to compare
Crimson Tide to the movies mentioned, The Enemy Below and Run Silent, Run
Deep, it would stand proudly next to them.  Instead of putting out a
completely mindless action movie, where the two men battle it out with
flying bullets and fists, Crimson Tide is the battle of will between the
two men.  The film makes the audience think with the two men, about the
consequences of their actions, and who is really right.  Though I was more
sympathetic and understanding to Washington's Hunter, Hackman's Ramsey was
not wrong at all either.
Washington gives a great performance as Hunter.  He presents Hunter as a
strong willed man, who is not afraid to take a stand against even a
superior when he believes that he is right.  Hackman also does a great job
with Ramsey.  Hackman gives a layered performance, putting a happy easy
going exterior to Ramsey, but showing the darker interior from time to
time.  It is the performances of these two that carry Crimson Tide.  But,
the supporting cast also gives great performances.  These include Matt
Craven, Rocky Carroll, Danny Nucci, and Lillo Brancato.  The strongest
supporting actor in Crimson Tide would be a toss up between Viggo Mortensen
(who you can catch right now in G.I. Jane) and George Dzundza.
By all means, Crimson Tide is one of the most enjoyable films made.  It is
well directed, well acted, and well scripted.  Tony Scott knows how to
build up emotions throughout the film, and does it well.  The film will not
only make you think, it will entertain you while making you think.  Sure,
this doesn't feel like a Tony Scott film at first, but you'll get used to
it.  And I hope Tony Scott can put out more great films like Crimson Tide.
Don't miss this one.

Title
Review for Rounders (1998)
If Martha Stewart were to make Rounders, here's how she would do it. She
would take one serving of the movie Rocky. From that she'd take out
Sylvester Stalone, not cute enough for her. She'd also take out the boxing,
too violent for her. Then she'd add Matt Damon in place of Sylvester
Stalone, cute to her. Also she'd change boxing to poker. To make the film a
bit more attractive, we add some sugar and spice, Famke Janssen (GoldenEye)
and newcomer Gretchen Mol. Stir until there are no lumps, bake for two
hours, take out of the oven and let cool for another ten minutes.
Rounders, though it doesn't seem like it at first, is a typical sports
film. The protagonist, Mike McDermott (Damon), opens the film losing
everything he has to a master poker player, Teddy KGB (John Malkovich). He
then falls into a state of acceptance that what he'd done was all wrong.
That is, until some external force, this time a character named Worm
(Edward Norton), brings the protagonist back into the fringes of the sport.
In Rounders, it's poker, where he must go through an uphill battle to try
to regain his confidence in the sport. And in a typical sports film, in
order for the protagonist to regain his confidence he needs to face the
person he lost it all to in the beginning of the film.
Rounders shows us where real poker is played. Real poker is not played in
the glitzy casinos. No, real poker is played in smoky black rooms. Real
poker players can figure out what the other players's hands are doing just
by watching their reaction as they get their cards. Real poker is a game
where you can lose everything you have in a hand.
As formulaic as Rounders sounds, it's quite a good character study of the
two main characters, McDermott and Worm. McDermott is the guy who thinks
that he's escaped the draw and glitter of poker but really hasn't. Worm is
the risk-taking self-destructive character who could win it all straight,
but still cheats to win just for the thrill.
Damon, who seems almost typecast as the "smart normal guy" plays McDermott
not too differently than he did with Will Hunting (Good Will Hunting).
Which is not a bad thing, especially for Rounders. We feel for McDermott as
he gets dragged deeper and deeper into the underground poker rooms.
Norton, who was brilliant in Primal Fear, turns up another great
performance in Rounders. He plays his character Worm as an unpredictable,
self-loving, and self-destructive person who will risk even his life for a
thrill.
Newcomer Gretchen Mol isn't given much to do. She gets relegated to the
role of the whiny girlfriend who lives in a boring - and unneeded -
melodramatic subplot. Also the beautiful Famke Janssen is also given
nothing to do but to smile and walk around in alluring dresses.
Worth mentioning is John Malkovich as Teddy KGB. Malkovich is just fun to
watch. His Teddy KGB likes to eat Oreo cookies, slowly chewing on them and
enjoying the cookies. Malkovich, like his Teddy KGB, likes to use his
Russian accent. He takes his Russian accent and slowly chews on it and
enjoys it. Malkovich steals the screen.
Director John Dahl keeps Rounders from sliding into boring seriousness by
slipping in some funny moments throughout the film. The humor keeps the
film moving. I loved how the poker players hit the casinos and play against
unsuspecting tourists. At the casinos, none of them are playing as allies,
but they still end up taking money from the tourists like candy from a baby.
The ending to Rounders is not hard to guess, especially given what kind of
film Rounders is. And it is the predictability of the film that makes it a
bit hard to sit through its running time. I wish the writers and film
makers would have taken a chance, a risk, like the poker players, and put
in a ending worthy of the film. I recommend Rounders if you have a spare
two hours to spend.

Title
Review for Midnight Run (1988)
Midnight Run shows how a simple formula film can be more than just another
road-movie or action-film. George Gallo populates his script with colorful
and memorable characters. All of the characters are thoughtful and
dimensional. The two leads are even more so than the minor characters, but
all are well rounded.
Jack Walsh is a bounty hunter, working for a sleazy lying bondsman, Eddie.
Walsh was not always a bounty hunter though, he used to be a Chicago cop,
but a mobster, Jimmy Serrano, ran him out of Chicago. The bondsman, Eddie,
has a problem on his hands; he bailed out a white-collar criminal, Jonathan
Mardukas on a very large bail, and that money means a lot to Eddie.
Mardukas, or the Duke, has embezzled a large chunk of money from the
mobster Serrano. The FBI, led by Alonzo Mosley is on the hunt for the Duke
and so is Serrano. The FBI wants the Duke to testify against Serrano,
Serrano just wants him dead. There is also a second bounty hunter looking
for the Duke, Marvin. Marvin is a clumsy and dim-witted bounty hunter.
Walsh just wants to find the Duke for the $100,000 bounty.
Walsh finds the Duke in New York and has five days to bring him to Los
Angeles, to collect his bounty, which he plans to open a coffee shop with.
Sounds easy, but not so. The movie goes from here as a cross-country road
trip with Walsh and the Duke. All of the time is trying to outrun the mob,
FBI, and Marvin.
The characters and the interaction between them are intricate, but not so
large that the audience gets lost. Action flies between airplanes, trains,
buses, cars, trains, and a few other vehicles. But, with all of this
action, the story is not lost. The director, Martin Brest (Beverly Hills
Cop), makes the movie very balanced. Just when the action is too intense,
he throws in some humor. And when the action or humor get in the way, he
stops and puts in a scene to develop character. Brest does a good job of
moving between these three.
Robert DeNiro gives a great performance as Jack Walsh. He is gives a
humorous, yet serious, portrayal of Walsh. And when he is funny, he is
funny. He gets his laughs, not by going all out for them, but by letting
his character do funny things but not know it. Charles Grodin gives an
equally great performance as the Duke. On screen they are the perfect
odd-couple. It is the chemistry of the two leads that carry the story along
the casting director should be congratulated for casting such a perfect pair.
Along side the leads are the good performances by the supporting cast.
Dennis Farina looks as if he's having a great time as the mobster Serrano.
He is mean and very scary on screen. Yaphet Kotto is also mean and scary on
screen, as the FBI agent, Alonzo Mosley, who is looking for Walsh and the
Duke. Joe Pantoliano is the wild, and potty mouthed, Eddie, the bail
bondsman. But, the most memorable supporting cast would be Wendy Phillips
as Jack Walsh's ex-wife.
The music, by Danny Elfman, is worth mentioning. Instead of orchestrating
the music for the film, the music is done by a small band. The music is
jazzy when the action kicks in, but slow and moody when there is a
character development scene. The music, like all other Elfman scores, fits
in so well with the film that at times you don't notice it.
Midnight Run is an example of the perfect smart and funny action film.
Characters that are dimensional and likeable populate it. Midnight Run is
on my list of most favorite movies, and after you see it, it'll be on yours
too. Don't miss this film.
"You two are the worst bounty hunters I have ever seen! You couldn't even
deliver a bottle of milk!" - the Duke

Title
Review for True Romance (1993)
"True Romance" is one of those films that I love because of style over 
substance. The writing is excellent and the direction is excellent. The 
story is average and the ending abysmal, but the path in which "True 
Romance" takes from start to that ending is astonishing.
"True Romance" follows a couple, Clarence (Christian Slater) and Alabama 
(Patricia Arquette). Clarence is a strange fellow who works in a comic book 
store and enjoys "classic" kung-fu movies. Alabama is a call girl who has a 
large sense of innocence  Clarence is only her fourth client.
Now, since this is a script written by Quentin Tarantino you can expect 
lots of violence, sharp lines, and plot-twist that you wouldn't see from a 
mile away. So, let me drop some actor names and characters on you and see 
if you can put them together, as to not spoil the film for you. There's 
Gary Oldman playing a mean pimp, Val Kilmer plays a famous dead rock star, 
Samuel L. Jackson makes a quick stop, Dennis Hopper is a father, Bradd Pitt 
is a lazy bum roommate, James Gandolfini is one scary mobster, and 
Christopher Walken is, well, Christopher Walken. Now, there are some really 
interesting elements in the film too. Elvis, a suitcase of cocaine, guns, 
lots of guns, a bag of money, and well an eye-patch. Can you make head from 
tail of those things? You'll see how they all fit together when you see 
"True Romance".
Tarantino's script for the movie is absolutely brilliant in the sense that 
it has some of the best dialogue around. And all of it is memorable. The 
story though is a bit bland and the ending, well, it's quite reminiscent of 
Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs" (not to mention director, Tony Scott's recent 
"Enemy of the State".) But this is not to say that the movie is 
unwatchable. Watching "True Romance" is more about watching interesting 
character speak interesting lines. It is also about watching the style of 
direction that Tony Scott puts into the film.
Scott, whose films include "Top Gun", "Days of Thunder", "Crimson Tide", 
and "Enemy of the State" shows off his visual flair with "True Romance". 
Every scene is meticulously setup and polished and it is very evident with 
what is seen. Though Scott is a brilliant filmmaker in these polished 
sequences, the one thing he cannot shoot are shootouts. Looking at the 
shootouts in "True Romance" and "Enemy of the State" he seems to capture 
the chaos of a shootout, but he does not put it in a way that is easy to 
follow. The camera wiggles and flies, bodies fly, there are loud sounds, 
but it's all a blurry mess.
The two leads in the film do well. Slater, who I don't think is an action 
star, does well with his part as a slightly crazed Clarence. He has that 
subtle look of innocence that is easily mixed with a dark psyche. Arquette 
is great as Alabama, who like Clarence looks innocent and acts that way 
too, but has a hidden dark side that escapes in the film. Both create a 
superb chemistry onscreen. What was surprising were the large names in the 
supporting roles. As mentioned before, you can see that there are many big 
names in this film and they play rather smaller supporting roles. This 
leads to a film that is rich in good performances. Worth mentioning is 
James Gandolfini ("The Sopranos") who is absolutely terrifying as a mobster.
If you watch True Romance for the characters, the great dialogue, and 
visual style you'll not be disappointed. If you want a good story, you'll 
be a little disappointed. Don't Miss True Romance. This a film with words 
to remember.

Title
Review for Con Air (1997)
Con Air is the first production of Jerry Bruckheimer's without the late Don 
Simpson. Con Air also brings Nicolas Cage back to work with Bruckheimer again. 
Last summer's The Rock was their last film working together. So how does Con 
Air hold up to The Rock?
Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a man whose life story seems to be about being 
in the wrong place at the wrong time. On his way home from the Army, Poe meets 
with his newly pregnant wife Tricia (Monica Potter) in a bar. They kiss and 
they dance, but their dance is cut short by a group of rowdy men in the bar. 
Poe and his wife leave the bar, running to their car in the rain, as they 
arrive at their car they meet those rowdy men again. In a fight with the men, 
trying to protect his wife, Poe kills one of the men. Poe is sent to jail for 
murder. After serving eight years of his sentence, he is now ready to go on 
parole.  He is ready to meet his daughter for the first time.
Poe catches a ride home on an airplane full of convicted murders and rapists. 
He rides along with his cellmate who is being transferred and is badly in need 
of a needle to take his insulin. John Cusack, who is quickly becoming one of 
my most favourite actors, is US Marshal Vince Larkin, who is on ground 
overseeing the transfer of all these prisoners. As the plane takes off, Cyrus 
"The Virus" Grissom (John Malkovich) and Nathan "Diamond Dog" Jones (Ving 
Rhames), two really bad men, escape their cells and take over the flight, 
dubbing the flight Con Air. From this point on, we are supposed to suspend our 
disbelief and go along for the ride. For some movies it is easy to do this, 
especially since it is the summer movie season, but in Con Air it is difficult 
to swallow.
Con Air tries to go over the top, like last summer's The Rock, but rookie 
director Simon West is unable to create the same excitement in the action 
sequences as Michael Bay did in The Rock. He is unable to reach the same 
level. And the end result is a movie that does not work for this exact reason. 
 West is unable to create the action sequences that would have helped the 
audience to over come the implausibility of the film.
The ensemble cast gives a great performance except for a few. Colm Meaney 
gives more of an annoying performance as an angry DEA agent. Renoly, as Sally 
Can't Dance, really has no place in the film more than comic relief. And to 
that extent, it is poorly executed. Steve Buscemi, as Carland "The Marietta 
Mangler" Greene, who is describe as worse than the whole Manson family 
together, is in the film, but for the life of me, I cannot figure out why.
On the bright side the lead performers give solid performances. Nicolas Cage 
does well as Cameron Poe, though it takes a little time to adjust to his 
strange adopted accent in this film. "If you see muh waif, tell er ah love 
er," he tells US Marshal Vince Larkin. John Malkovich is genuinely scary as 
Cyrus the Virus. He portrays Cyrus as a dangerous and insane, yet very 
intelligent man. Ving Rhames, although not as strong a performance as in 
Mission: Impossible and Pulp Fiction still pulls off a great performance.  
John Cusack is the guy that is right, but is always doubted, and as US Marshal 
Vince Larkin, he shows his frustration.
Con Air tries really hard to be a loud summer action movie filled with 
explosions and action, and to an extent it is successful.  But it doesn't try 
hard enough and it has many shortcomings, including the hard to swallow story 
and some weak supporting performances.  If you really have two hours to burn, 
and those two hours happen to fall into a matinee show time, then catch Con 
Air.  If not, save your money, Con Air crashes and burns before it even takes 
off.  Maybe next time Jerry Bruckheimer.

Review for Gattaca (1997)
In the not too distant future you can have the child of your dreams. Don't
want your child to have violent tendencies? The geneticists can remove that
gene. Disease? The geneticist can tell how long your child will live, what
the child will die from, and can eliminate that gene also. Want the child
to be a piano prodigy? Well, lets give him twelve fingers. 
The premise for Gattaca is great. In the not too distant future, DNA
manipulation is helping society crank out near perfect children. Natural
inception is no longer wanted, instead, society has geneticists who will
help create the perfect child. Everything about a person can be told with
as little as a hair, dandruff, a drop of blood, or saliva.
Though law prohibits gene discrimination, the law against this
discrimination is also not well administered. Discrimination is now not
based on sex, age, or skin color, but on genes. Obviously, the perfected or
valid children get more than the "unperfected" or in-valid children.
Society is now split because of this. Vincent is one of the "unperfected"
children growing up with his older brother who is a perfected child.
Vincent aims to go to the stars, but, because of his genes, companies will
accept him. Because no matter how hard he tries, he will never have the
genes of a laboratory created child, which is what the space company
Gattaca is looking for.
Working with a gene broker, Vincent meets up with Jerome. Jerome is a
perfected child but is now left to languish because he was hit by a car and
is paralyzed from the waist down. Vincent uses Jerome's blood, urine, and
hair to get into Gattaca. But, after qualifying for a yearlong trip to a
moon of Saturn, there is a murder in Gattaca and Vincent becomes the number
one suspect.
Gattaca is a well-intentioned film with a well-intentioned message. And
there are passages of Gattaca that are really enjoyable. The set design and
the cinematography create a world where everything is sterile. But, the
director and writer Andrew Niccol creates characters that are,
unfortunately, also as sterile. The performances of the lead actors are
just as sterile. Hawke shows little to no emotion during the film, even at
the climax. Uma Thurman seems to be in the film just to look good.
What stands out and is not sterile are the supporting cast and the music.
The supporting cast includes the inspector played by Alan Arkin and Jerome
played by Jude Law. Arkin gives a wonderful performance but is not given
enough screen time. Law is given more screen time and does a better job.
Law is the one to look for during the film. The music is quiet and haunting
and fits the movie just right.
Gattaca is without its flaws. Though, most of them don't show up until one
steps out of the theatre. For example, the security entrance for Gattaca
uses a little pin that pricks one's finger for blood that is
instantaneously analyzed. This lets the computer allow or deny one's
entrance into the company based on their DNA. Vincent easily gets past this
device, but I can thing of many ways that can be added to this device that
are more conventional and less painful. (Maybe retinal scans? Fingers print?)
Gattaca is definitely a matinee film that, if you can wait, could be seen
on video. A very well intentioned film that falls because of its length,
exceptionally slow pace, and sterile performances by its lead actors. For
those expecting to see some heavy sci-fi, action and special effects, you
will be disappointed. This is a drama wrapped around a sci-fi premise.

Review for Die Hard (1988)
Well, what can you say about the film that set up it's own genre? This
film, though may not have been the first of it's type, was the one that
spawned a whole slew of copy cats who used the high-concept of "Die Hard in
a ."
This is the first film of the Die Hard Trilogy. It is Christmas and John
McClane (Bruce Willis), a New York cop is flying into LA to see his kids
and his estranged wife (Bonnie Bedelia). As he waits to talk to her
privately in the new Nakatomi building where she works and where the
company is holding its Christmas party, all hell breaks loose as terrorist
seize the building. McClane escapes the grasps of the terrorists but stays
in the building to wreak havoc on the terrorists' plans. Unknown to the
terrorists McClane is also staying in the building to save his wife who is
part of the group taken.
Outside the building we have a set of stock characters, except for one. The
stock characters include a bumbling police chief whose only job seems to be
to act stupid and disagree with everything McClane says, a pair of dumb FBI
agents whose job seems to make the life of the terrorist much easier, and
an ambulance chasing reporter who goes to extremes to get the live story. I
think most of these outside stock characters could have -- should have --
been removed to ease the story. The only things these characters do is slow
up the story and ruin the pace. The only character outside of the building
that seems normal and developed is Reginald VelJohnson's Sgt. Al Powell.
Inside the building is one of my most favourite bad guys, Hans Gruber (Alan
Rickman). Gruber is an educated man who exudes calmness while he secretly
has his reasons for leading the terrorists into the building. Gruber though
is not a man to play with; he is ruthless and will go to any extreme to get
it.
The action in Die Hard has to be seen. It is some incredible action and
director John McTiernan shows that he can shoot action sequences well.
There is the famous scene with Willis jumping off the top of the building
with an explosion behind him. But, if you thought that was exciting wait to
you see how McTiernan continues that sequence and gets you to the edge of
your seat. There are other well set up action sequences in Die Hard that
have this stand out quality.
The performances that I loved were those of Bruce Willis as John McClane
and Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. And though Willis is supposed to be the
lead character of Die Hard, it is Rickman who steals the show with is
controlled insanity as Gruber.
Die Hard made it's own genre that everyone tried to follow, but there is
only the one true Die Hard. Don't miss this film.
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherf*cker!" - John McClane.

Review for Cruel Intentions (1999)
Cruel Intentions is one of those films that you'll like if there is someone
in the film you enjoy watching. Else, the film is a somewhat toned down and
less enjoyable version of Wild Things. For me, I enjoyed the film only
because of Sarah Michelle Gellar. I'm sure that there will be flocks of
young women who will enjoy the film immensely because of Ryan Phillippe.
Cruel Intentions is loosely based on "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" by
Choderlos de Laclos. The film starts off with an intriguing shot; it's a
helicopter shot aimed directly at the ground, the only things we see are
white motion-blurred objects flying by. It took me a few seconds to realize
what I was looking at, and when I did, I knew this was foreshadowing for
something that was going to happen sometime later in the film. 
Sabastian (Ryan Phillippe) is a bored guy, who can bed just about any girl.
The only girl he wants to bed, and can't, is his stepsister Katherine
(Sarah Michelle Gellar). These two promiscuous stepsiblings are bored with
their sexual conquests; they are just too easy for them. Sex is just a game
that these two have mastered it. They turn their attention towards
outsiders; they are cruel and know that they can use sex against others.
Other people's misery is their pleasure. In a game, Katherine bets
Sabastian that he can't bed the daughter of the new headmaster of their
school. A self-proclaimed virgin-till-she-meets-the-right-guy, Annette
(Reese Witherspoon) is the ultimate challenge for Sabastian. If Sabastian
is able to sleep with Annette, then he gets the ultimate prize: a night
with Katherine. If he can't, then Katherine gets his prized possession: his
sports car.
Cruel Intentions is, by all means, an uneven film. The performances, music,
film score, and mood were all uneven. The only thing that is solid is the
cinematography by Theo Van de Sande (Blade).
Performance-wise Gellar and Phillippe put in decent, if a bit sterile,
performances. Both of them hit their parts right on and are believable as
conniving and evil. Selma Blair does not fare as well. Blair's performance
is the sore thumb of the whole film. Her character was just too offbeat and
strange, she did not fit into the film and every time she took to the
screen it drew me out of the film and into the state of thinking, "Does she
think she's in There's Something About Mary?"  The one performer that was
fabulous was Resse Witherspoon.
For the record, no one gets naked in Cruel Intentions (though Phillippe
shows off his butt), there are a few erotic scenes, but nothing too racy in
the film. Still, this film is not for the younger teenage crowd  which the
producers and studio seem to be taking aim at. Cruel Intentions is one of
those films that tries hard to entertain and only accomplishes the task
halfway. The script and direction by Roger Kumble is mediocre at best.
There's a film that I kept thinking is similar to Cruel Intentions and that
film is Wild Things. Wild Things didn't take itself so seriously, and in
the end Wild Things was more enjoyable. Catch Cruel Intentions at a matinee
showing, else, wait for video.
