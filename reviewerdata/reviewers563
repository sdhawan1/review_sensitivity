Review for Black and White (1999)
Starring Brooke Shields, Robert Downey Jr., Ben Stiller, Allan Houston,
Elijah Wood, Bijou Phillips, Power. Directed by James Toback. Rated R.
I think that in making Black and White director James Toback took all
of the ideas he had and threw them up into the air with his eyes closed
and fingers crossed, hoping to God that they somehow land in the right
place. Indeed, the pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. The film
is about a lot of things and all of them are prevalent in one way or
another. With such a maddeningly large array of themes and subjects,
it's mighty impressive that Black and White works as well as it does.
And yet instead of visualizing a cinematic genius intricately crafting
a complex work of art, the image I got from watching the movie was that
of Toback, sleep-deprived and haggard, desperately attempting the
Herculean task of putting together a magnum opus in 15 minutes and
miraculously succeeding.
There are a lot of overlapping storylines here and in its plotting, the
film resembles a (deliberately?) disorganized version of Magnolia or
Cradle Will Rock. It is being sold as a look at white people obsessed
with black culture, but that is only one of the stories. It involves a
documentary filmmaker (Brooke Shields) shooting a film about the
subject, the group of kids (including a surprisingly convincing Elijah
Wood and Bijou Phillips) who are her focus and her husband (Robert
Downey Jr.), who is obviously gay even though his wife doesn't seem to
realize it.
There is also the story of a star college point guard (real basketball
player Allan Houston), who is approached by a policeman (Ben Stiller)
posing as a gambler. His proposition: throw the upcoming game and get
$50,000 cash. The purpose of this maneuver is to set the nice but
gullable kid up and then blackmail him into ratting out one of his
buddies who is the head of a gang. The policeman also approaches the
district attorney whose son is involved with the gang leader with a
different sort of proposal. And then there is Mike Tyson who, playing
himself, is funny just by showing up.
Aware that a conventional filmmaking method for such unconventional
subject matter wouldn't do, Toback decided to let the actors improvise
a lot of their scenes. He gave them a general direction in which to
head, turned on the camera and let them do their thing. The result is
exactly what he was aiming for: the scenes have a flowing, unforced
feel to them. It doesn't feel like we're watching a documentary but
rather a movie that genuinely reflects real life. And anyway, no movie
in which Mike Tyson gets to say "This is what I'm deciphering from your
vernacular" can be all bad.
The surprise here is Allan Houston who has a real affablility and
screen presence. Unlike fellow basketball-star-cum-thespian Shaquille
O'Neal, Houston may have a real career in store for himself if he
chooses to use his talent wisely and not accept projects trying to
exploit his basketball stardom. In Black and White, Houston's troubled
point guard is the only character I liked as a person.
Not everything works. Not every theme comes through loud and clear. The
Ben Stiller character gets a lot of screen time and the movie makes a
big deal out of him but he's never really explored and we struggle to
understand him. In the end, Black and White works as a gritty slice-of-
life movie, not trying to say anything concrete but simply to show. A
lot is thrown on the screen and most of it hits home.

Review for Fever Pitch (1997)
"They were f***ing rubbish last year. And they were f***ing rubbish the
year before. And I don't care if they are top of the League, they'll be
f***ing rubbish this year, too. And next year. And the year after that.
I'm not joking."
Starring Colin Firth, Ruth Gemmell. Not Rated (some strong profanity,
not much else... would probably still get an R rating).
Having lived in Europe for nine years, I experienced first hand the
sensation that is soccer. One of the world's great mysteries, in my
opinion, is how America managed to almost completely avoid this
phenomenon. Sure, there's a league, and yeah, there are fans, but does
anyone ever hear anything about the teams? Are they ever on the news? In
the paper? Do the games set attendance records? Never. Indeed, the USA
blasphemously renamed it "soccer", alloting its real moniker,
"football", to a sport where feet are hardly ever even used.
For the doubters of this sport's unearthly popularity comes a little
British movie named Fever Pitch. It isn't a soccer movie as much as it
about obsession with soccer. It has some sports elements, but at its
core its a love story and a life story. It doesn't always work, but it's
always pleasant. It is not a comedy, though apparently it's being
marketed as one, but rather a serious, often somber drama about a man's
life being ruined by his pious devotion to a sports team.
Based on the autobiography of one Nick Hornby, who also adapted it for
the screen, Fever Pitch explores the life of Paul, a mildmannered
schoolteacher who turns into a rabid, profane fan at soccer games. Since
he was a child, Paul has closely followed the soccer team "Arsenal".
They have not captured the league title for 18 years, and for all that
time, he has been patiently waiting for them to get somewhere. Now, all
signs point to yes -- it seems the time has come for Arsenal to go all
the way. Paul has never been this excited, but the timing couldn't be
worse.
You see, he has entered a relationship with a co-worker (Ruth Gemmell).
Needless to say, she is not a soccer fan, nor is she happy with Paul's
Arsenal obsession. She assumes, not incorrectly, that his team means
more to him than both she and his upcoming baby, and she sees the sport
as something she has to compete with to earn his boyfriend's attention.
Paul recognizes the problem, but something subconcious keeps him from
letting go of his soccer life, even a little bit.
Besides his life as an adult, the film also tracks some of Paul's
childhood; specifically how his father inspired his love for soccer.
Though a few of these scenes have a clunky feel to them, they tend to be
the movie's least contrived. The ones that work have a more natural flow
to them than some of what we are presented with in Paul's adulthood.
Much of Fever Pitch is affecting and sincerely felt. It's premise isn't
the freshest I've ever seen but it's unconventional enough to make an
occasional impact. Colin Firth's Paul is a very effective character; his
everyday Joe affability mixes ominously with his uncomfortably deep
obsession with what is merely a hobby for most. Firth's generally
reserved, occasionally explosive performance contributes to his
persona's impressive on-screen presence.
The biggest problem with Fever Pitch is the pseudo-romance at the heart
of the plot. We are never shown any positives in their relationship. The
two spend the whole movie giving each other wounded looks -- when they
aren't bitching, that is. We are supposed to want the relationship to be
mended; we're expected to root for Paul to devote more of his life to
it, but we can't. From what we are shown, there isn't any reason for
these two to stay together. The only feeling they ever display towards
each other is contempt.
The happy ending reduces the otherwise unusual film to being merely an
ordinary sports movie, muddling its message. It felt like it belonged in
another, more upbeat movie, and here it was simply out of place. It
leaves the audience at a loss, unsure what to make of Fever Pitch. On
one hand it's a dark tale of obsession, on the other it's a
simple-minded fable about blind devotion. The movie's denoument leaves
us wondering just which one of them it is.
This is a British Indie film, and it was more superficially entertaining
than I have come to expect from its type. Unfortunately unlike works of
Brits like Mike Leigh, it is also confused about what exactly it wants
to tell us. It engrosses the viewer and then proceeds to confuse him.

Title
Review for Tigger Movie, The (2000)
Featuring the voice talents of Jim Cummings, Nikita Hopkins, Ken
Sansom, John Fiedler, Peter Cullen. Directed by Jun Falkenstein. Rated
G.
You would expect the first theatrical feature based on the popular A.
A. Milne Winnie the Pooh tales to be something memorable, children's
entertainment for the ages. You'd think so, wouldn't you? Well, Disney
never ceases to surprise us. This release seems purely perfunctory,
made for a quick buck with no heart or much effort poured into it. It
doesn't even star everybody's favorite bear (assuming you don't like
Yogi). The Tigger Movie is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff; the youngest
set of kids might enjoy it, but I doubt they'll want to watch it again
or even remember it after a couple of days. Call me a Disney purist,
but when it comes to their animation department, I expect the best and
am rather irritated when I don't get it.
Pooh has crushingly little screen time because, as one might glean from
the title, the focus of the film is Tigger, that lovable, striped
companion. Unable to find anyone to "bounce" with him one afternoon,
Tigger realizes that he might have a family somewhere and goes off
searching for it. He looks for a family tree -- literally a tree,
because he doesn't know any better. He's inevitably disappointed
because even with the help of his moderately bouncy young kangaroo
companion Roo, the search comes up empty.
Seeing their pal's disappointment, Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit and Iore plot
to write a phony letter from his family and then have a phony family
(them dressed in Tigger costumes) show up at Tigger's door. The final
message, of course, is that friends are your family too and, as might
be expected from a movie whose target audience's age is in the single
digits, it is delivered with little subtlety. I'm perfectly fine with
this as long as there is a certain grace and joie de vivre to the film.
That's where this Tigger comes up short.
The animation is old-school and that's the way it's supposed to be. It
has that very Pooh-ish storybook quality that fits the franchise like a
glove; it's Disney's one cash cow that has refused to be taken over by
high-tech gimmickery. What doesn't work is, well, everything else.
Tigger's a pretty good character, but his babbling, word-butchering
schtick gets old pretty fast. That's usually where the supporting
players come to the rescue but The Tigger Movie doesn't let them be
themselves. Winnie himself shows up only a couple of times so that he
can do his trademark climbing-a-tree-after-honey-only-to-be-attacked-by-
a-swarm-of-bees. Iore's presence, too, is merely for the sake of him
being there. Piglet barely even opens his mouth. The Disney movie mill
has stripped these beloved, age-old characters of almost all
personality for the sake of commercialization and also to fit everyone
into an 80-minute movie while focusing primarily on Tigger. The Winnie
the Pooh series was so enduring because the characters worked together
to solve a problem; this really is Tigger's movie.
I, of course, am not the target audience for this film so I am hard-
pressed to say whether you should take your children to see this movie
or not. The youngest set will almost certainly enjoy it. But when it
comes to continuing the Pooh saga with grace and dignity, The Tigger
Movie doesn't get the job done. It's passable, but I apparently wanted
more than Disney could provide with a film that isn't their
annual "animated feature."

Title
Review for Rush Hour 2 (2001)
Starring Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Chris Penn, John
Lone, Ziyi Zhang. Directed by Brett Ratner. Rated
PG-13.
I guess it's a credit to Jackie Chan and the general
likeability of the franchise that Rush Hour 2 could
not be ruined even by the nauseating "comedy" of Chris
Tucker. I'm a fan of Jackie Chan in just about any
medium, and this movie lets him not only do his
impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick, but show off
his comic timing as well. It would have worked better
if he was the only name above the title.
The plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline
for stunts and special effects. This time around, the
evil smugglers are led by Ricky Tan (John Lone), who
makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into
the United States (I'm still not sure how you can make
a fortune doing that: is there a place where one can
exchange fake bills for real ones?). The only way to
tell the phony money from the genuine article is to
set it on fire and see what color it burns.
Of course, it's up to Hong Kong Detective Lee (Chan)
and trash-talking LAPD Detective James Carter (Tucker)
to take the bad guys out and the authorities, to the
extent that they even exist, stay out of their way.
Rush Hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that
here it's Carter who gets the two of them into trouble
and Lee who winds up having to get them out.
I guarantee that my rating would have been at least a
half of a grade higher had anyone other than Chris
Tucker been cast as the foil for Jackie Chan. He
refuses to shut up. Not only did his voice feel like a
jackhammer on my head, but his jokes just aren't
funny, a pathetic mixture of sub-par Eddie Murphy
fasttalking blather and wannabe Chris Rock
white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more
offensive than funny. I realize that in a movie like
this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the
actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates, but
didn't anyone realize how irritating Tucker's
incessant ranting and raving was? If this is all the
comedian has to offer then I don't care to see any
more of his films.
Fortunately, Chan makes for a marvelous straight man,
and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely. It's
not often that one actor can so completely save a
movie, but there is no other name for what he does;
whenever he's on screen, Rush Hour 2 comes to nearly
breathtaking, often hilarious, life. Much of it hinges
on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch Chan
try to be a "player," but who cares? I can think of
few high concepts that are funnier.
The movie ends with outtakes that, as usual, show that
Chan isn't perfect, and that it does, indeed, take him
a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to
look seamless. Chris Tucker botches some lines as
well, and his mistakes are funnier than anything he
says in the whole movie.
A lot of people have pointed out Rush Hour 2 isn't
very different from its predecessor in tone or style.
But I liked the original, and I like the sequel,
though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best
to ruin it. Director Brett Ratner (The Family Man)
keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to
keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable
hit to miss ratio of the jokes (I guess sometimes the
shotgun approach works). It's not great Jackie Chan,
but it's Jackie Chan, and that's enough.

Review for Blue Streak (1999)
Martin Lawrence is in the first stages of big-time Hollywood fame. The
amiable comic got his very first breakout hit earlier this year with
Life, in which he co-starred with Murphy. Almost right on its heels
comes Blue Streak, another sure-fire box-office winner which puts
Lawrence at the head of a genre-hopping plot and an unexpectedly clever
script. He delivers and the movie triumphs. A nice recovery, also, on
the part of director Les Mayfield whom I all but gave up on after the
travesty that was Flubber.
Wasting no time, Mayfield throws us into the action. Lawrence plays
Miles Logan (have you ever heard a phonier Hollywood name?), a high-
stakes jewel thief, and in his latest heist, he has a complicated plan
to steal a diamond the size of a golf ball. He blunders big time and the
police are on to him, but before he can be arrested, he hides the
diamond in what seems to be the ventilation shaft of an abandoned
warehouse. After two years in the slammer, he comes back to retrieve his
treasure, only to find that his hiding place is now a police station and
the ventilation shaft is smack in the middle of the robbery homicide
department.
He attempts to infiltrate the building by posing as a pizza delivery
man. No luck there. "There are two kinds of people who get through that
door," he is told. "People wearing handcuffs and people wearing a
badge." Now there's an idea! He goes to an old buddy of his, who finds
it in his heart to make Miles fake police ID. He enters robbery homicide
claiming to be a newly transferred detective with an astonishing 16
(count 'em) citations in his former place of employment. Miles, being
the seasoned veteran that he is, is partnered with a newbie in the
department and proceeds to show him how the "big boys" work, often to
riotous results. He searches for "his baby" while attempting to come off
as a convincing police officer. He has unexpected success in the latter,
of course. He does find the diamond almost right away, too, but nothing
is that easy -- otherwise we wouldn't have a movie.
Blue Streak's plot is trite and generic, an assortment of formulas from
all different sources, including but not limited to the buddy movie, the
wacky cop movie and the always reliable mistaken identity caper. How
does it work, exactly? A lot of things come together for Mayfield, who's
a pretty lucky bastard, considering what he had coming into this high-
risk project: a sharp, witty script from Michael Berry and John
Blumenthal, as well as the extremely talented Lawrence, whose
performance will surely help his Hollywood status (read: raise his
asking price).
It got off to a slow start, and I was getting into that weird mind-set
of mine where I am actually excited about hating a film, but 20-25
minutes in, Blue Streak was beginning to grow on me. I realized that the
jokes were hitting the target. The script found new ways to wring laughs
out of tired situations, and though it wasn't consistently the most
hilarious things I've ever seen, I found solace in the fact that this
movie would still have been made had the writing relied only on old,
formulaic gags, like so many of today's Hollywood screenplays tend to
do. I enjoyed the parts that worked, and a good many did, but I could
even appreciate those that didn't quite get there, because most of them
found fresh ways to fail.
Martin Lawrence rises above the material every chance he gets. A
skillful ad libber, he is more than a fast-talking Eddie Murphy wannabe
(Chris Tucker comes to mind). He is a good actor with a tough but
strangely outgoing style. He has a way of looking like he wants to hurt
you when necessary, but really just wants to be your friend. As a
result, his characters tend to be less one-dimensional even when the
script calls for a walking cliché. Lawrence brings that same spirit to
Blue Streak, making what could have been a mean-spirited comedy an
affectionate one.
Look, this isn't Dr. Strangelove. It isn't even Bowfinger. But for what
it was, I liked it. Blue Streak is probably the most original unoriginal
comedy I've ever seen: a film that finds new ways to handle situations
you thought have been beaten into the ground by screenwriters past.

Review for Talented Mr. Ripley, The (1999)
Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett.
Directed by Anthony Minghella. Rated R.
He's a talented one himself, this Anthony Minghella. Three years ago,
he scored big-time with his WWII weepie The English Patient. The film
all but swept the Oscars and was a resounding critical and box-office
success. Now Minghella comes out with another Oscar shoo-in that also
happens to be one of the year's best films. The Talented Mr. Ripley is
Minghella's proof that The English Patient was no accident.
A janitor at a philarmonic, Tom Ripley leads a rather boring life until
he is sent ti Italy to persuade Dickie Greenleaf, the snobby son of a
wealthy American businessman to come home. When he arrives, he finds
himself falling in love with Dickie's lifestyle. Instead of actively
pestering him to go home, Tom lives it up in Italy and Dickie's father
pays for it. Before long Tom falls in love with Dickie himself.
Halfway through the movie there is a confrontation wherein Tom murders
Dickie and takes on his identity. From there, he plays an elaborate
game of cat and mouse with the police and with Dickie's girlfriend
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), trying to make the police think that he is
Dickey and make Marge think that Dickie's dumped her. The twist is that
Tom is not some great conspirator; rather he is a modern reincarnation
of Machiavelli, a man who thinks on his feet and kills when he must
kill to achieve his goal. He is a great improviser.
You may have heard about the enigmatic Oscar nominee Cate Blanchett
having a role in this movie. Her part is small, but it's there. She
plays an American whom Tom tries to carry on an affair with while
juggling his many other problems. Her character serves to demonstrate
Tom's ability to inadvertently get way in over his head and then get
himself out of trouble with his quick thinking ability.
The Talented Mr. Ripley runs almost two and a half hours and yet the
pace and tone of the movie is pitch-perfect. By making the villain the
focus of the film, Minghella (or perhaps novelist Patricia Highsmith,
whose work this movie is based on) builds suspense quietly but
undeniably. It's far from being a traditional thriller: the director
doesn't use the soundtrack as an easy way out. The suspenseful scenes
are mostly dialogue based, with only a few incidents of real violence
but the result is as tense as anything.
Matt Damon gives what is surely his best performance to date as the
title character. He perfectly conveys Tom Ripley's central trait: he
doesn't seem to realize that he is a psychopath. At first he kills in
his own best interest; by the end of the movie he kills because he has
become addicted to lies, but he never seems to recognize that what he
is doing is wrong. He sees that police are chasing after him but he
never feels any guilt or remorse for his actions nor does he see any
reason why he should.
I've liked Jude Law since I first saw him in the intelligent sci-fi
thriller Gattaca and now, after a major role in eXistenZ, he one-ups
himself. His Dickie is one of the films biggest joys (please, no pun
intended) -- a spoiled brat who is also a decent guy and a compelling
character. I liked Gwyneth Paltrow almost as much: she is one of the
hardest-working actresses in show business and it always amazes me how
she can turn in such deeply felt performances in movie after movie
after movie.
One doesn't realize it at first, but The Talented Mr. Ripley is an
extremely bold endeavor: a supposedly mainstream thriller that deals
with concepts like homosexuality, betrayal and pathological lying in a
deliberately paced, long production. I felt grateful that this movie
was made. I didn't want it to end.

Title
Review for Hardball (2001)
Starring Keanu Reeves, John Hawkes, Trevor Morgan,
Bryan Hearne, Julian Griffith, Michael Jordan, Graham
Beckel, Allan Ellis Jr., Christopher Lofton, Michael
Perkins, Brian Reed, DeWayne Harris. Directed by Brian
Robbins. Rated PG-13.
Hardball isn't what the advertising made it look like,
but it's too close. It could have been an
extraordinary story in a familiar framework; instead,
it's a conventional story with a few extraordinary
moments. Indeed, there are times, usually a few
seconds long, when the film is so genuine and
heart-rending that you wonder if the story cliches
weren't dictated to director Brian Robbins in the
interest of making something populist. Oh, and in
serious movies, Keanu Reeves seems to consistently be
a problem.
Conor O'Neill (Reeves) enters a church late at night.
The priest tells him that it's time to lock up, and
asks "Do you need faith? Forgiveness?" The response?
"I need the Bulls to make the spread." And how:
O'Neill is thousands of dollars in debt to bookies and
sports bar owners around Chicago. His last resort is a
wealthy stockbroker friend of his, who's at the end of
his rope. Instead of "lending" O'Neill another twelve
thousand dollars, he agrees to pay five hundred a week
to coach an inner city kids' baseball team.
One of Hardball's virtues is humanizing the "street
kids," most of whom eventually become gang members, or
worse. They're streetsmart and trash-talking, but
they're kids, with the same fears and anxieties as any
other 10-year-old. And as O'Neill predictably
rehabilitates himself through coaching this
disorganized-but-talented group of baseball players,
the most vivid personalities that emerge are those
same children.
There are moments when Hardball comes utterly alive. I
got bleary-eyed during the scene at the major-league
stadium, when the kids wave at Sammy Sosa and... he
waves back. Another scene has O'Neill visiting the
Projects home of Andre, one of his players. When
O'Neill asks what the kids do around here for fun,
Andre responds: "Play baseball with you."
For all the success the movie has with those little
moments, it strikes out with the main storyline, which
takes precisely the course you would expect. There's
not a single surprise along the way, from the kids'
gradual acceptance of O'Neill and vice-versa, to his
miraculous recovery, to the "sudden" death of one of
the main characters to the Big Game at the end (though
to the movie's credit, the game itself isn't shown,
but the penultimate game is). There's even the naughty
sidekick who tries to pull the protagonist back into
his nightmare.
Keanu Reeves is problematic. He has had mild success
as a serious actor -- I liked him in The Devil's
Advocate, and The Watcher -- but here he's too
jittery, as if someone told him to exaggerate his
every motion to the point of his performance looking
for all the world like a pantomime. I didn't buy Diane
Lane as teacher/love interest either, but maybe that's
because the script doesn't give her a chance to become
a character.
I can't give Hardball a high rating, but I suppose I'm
fond of it. It has some real poignancy, and real
people, somewhere under that nightmare of a plot. In
light of recent events, and the daunting prospect of
"rebuilding," here's a movie about a character who,
however predictably, rebuilds himself. If only it had
been, say, Ed Norton, instead of poor, old Keanu. But
I hear The Matrix Reloaded has started filming.

Review for Love Stinks (1999)
"I'm gonna sue your ass for damages; FOR DAMAGING MY ASS!!!"
Starring French Stewart, Bridgette Wilson, Bill Bellamy, Tyra Banks.
Rated R.
The anti-romantic comedy is a genre (and it is a genre) that can never
aim for blockbuster status at the box-office. Who wants to see a comedy
about bad relationships? Most people have enough of that in their own
lives. To kick off the 1999 fall season, here's a movie -- and a good
one -- that tries to play off that notion. Touting the eye-catching
tagline "A Movie About a Relationship that's Worse than Yours," Love
Stinks, a shamelessly hilarious comedy, says that it's all right to
laugh at people's romantic travails.
3rd Rock From the Sun vet French Stewart gets his first shot at a
leading role playing Seth Winnick, a successful sitcom writer who falls
for Chelsea (Bridgette Wilson), a spunky interior decorator. Seth is
well-intentioned, but his new girlfriend has just one thing on her mind:
marriage. She is manipulative and deceitful -- even more so than most
other women (sorry, couldn't resist) -- and is willing to go to almost
any length to get an engagement ring out of the indecisive Seth, who,
in, turn refuses to say that he doesn't want to marry Chelsea but
doesn't propose either.
As his romance with Chelsea gets worse and worse, so does his sitcom
(which he likes to base partly on his life), and he is in danger of
losing his job. Chelsea doesn't seem to care; she schemes and plots all
the more intensely to walk down the isle with Seth. But when after a
year of waiting, Seth gives her diamond earrings instead of a ring, she
goes bonkers, moves out and slaps Seth with a palimony suit, leaving him
with nothing to do but think up a scheme of his own.
After I realized that the first 15 minutes of Love Stinks stunk, I was
starting to get psyched for actively hating the rest of it. But the
comedy picked up and before I knew it, I was laughing hysterically and
immensely enjoying this irresistably anarchic production. Indeed, Jeff
Franklin's (I can just hear a tv spot announcing "From the man behind
Full House comes an audacious comedy in the spirit of American Pie...")
film breaks every rule of the romantic comedy and does it with such glee
that even when a gag is fully predictable it's still entertaining.
I can see people perceiving Love Stinks to be a tirade against women. At
first glance, that's just what it seems to be. But, as the trailer for
the upcoming American Beauty proclaims, "Look closer." Everything that
transpires in the film is as much the guy's doing as it is the girl's.
The film's final twist shows us that it's not only women who can be
scheming and manipulative.
French Stewart is engaging, though slightly irritating as the unwilling
potential groom-to-be. His voice started to get on my nerves about
halfway though, but it's a respectable first lead performance. Bridgette
Wilson is deliciously bad-grrl, but Tyra Banks, who plays Chelsea's
friend should keep her day job (she's a supermodel). Under the laid-back
direction of Franklin, we tend to notice mostly the good in the
performances; the flaws are masked by hilarity.
The most important virtue of Love Stinks is that it is very, very funny.
The gags come at a furious pace, and even the ones that don't work
manage to supplement the film's purposefully unromantic atmosphere. If
it were a romantic comedy, it would be one of the best ones of the year;
as it stands, Love Stinks is a glorious antidote to the romantic comedy.
It's a movie about a relationship that's worse than yours. Go see it.

Review for A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)
"The real conundrum isn't to create a robot that can
love. It's getting a human to love it back."
Starring Haley Joel Osment, Jude Law, Frances
O'Connor, Sam Robards, William Hurt, Jack Thomas,
Brendan Gleeson and the voice of Jack Angel. Directed
by Steven Spielberg. Rated PG-13.
Everyone is talking about A.I. Artificial
Intelligence, and everyone wants to talk about it as a
collaboration between Steven Spielberg and the late
Stanley Kubrick. Though there are some interesting
points to be made on the subject, they have by now
been made elsewhere, and I'm not interested in
discussing it. The bizarre, upsetting, wonderful movie
stands on its own as a provocative masterpiece, that
rare piece of work with the courage to bewilder, be
misinterpreted and start arguments.
Like many, it took me two viewings to realize this. I
knew right away that I had seen something special, but
the film disturbed me so deeply that I looked for
flaws, and I found them. The second time, it was more
apparent that this is easily Spielberg's most mature,
most meticulous movie to date; what I perceived as
flaws were choices, not errors, and damn good ones in
retrospect.
A.I. begins with the familiar sight of crashing ocean
waves and narration by Ben Kingsley, who describes the
world after the melting of the polar ice caps. Major
cities, including New York, were drowned; thousands of
people starved to death. Strict population controls
were imposed by surviving governments. Humans became
increasingly dependant on mechas, robots that simulate
human appearance and behavior.
By now, Spielberg has already set the mood for at
least the first section of the film: chilling,
foreboding, the darkness of the subject matter
clashing with the sterile comfort of the futuristic
society it depicts; those expecting another E.T.
should already be disappointed. We fade to a
conference room, where Dr. Allen Hobby (William Hurt)
gives a speech on the prospects of building a robot
who can feel real human emotions, a robot child who
can love. Someone poses a question that Dr. Hobby is
unable to answer, one of the film's central themes: if
the robot genuinely loves its owner, what
responsibility does the human have towards the
machine? The answer isn't, as Roger Ebert
thoughtlessly wrote, "none." If we are responsible for
what we create, are we also responsible for the
emotions of a robot boy? After all, his feelings are
hardly more "simulated" than ours; they're all
electrical signals traveling through a network of
neurons.
Cybertronics, Inc. creates a prototype named David,
played here by Haley Joel Osment, and gives it to
Henry Swinton (Sam Robards), an employee, to try out.
He and his wife Monica (Frances O'Connor) already have
a son who is in a coma after an accident, evidently
beyond science's reach. Monica, understandably, has
trouble accepting a mecha replacement, and Henry
doesn't push her. David looks and acts like a real
boy, but not quite; there's something subtly off about
his behavior (for one thing, he never blinks). This
part of the film is icy and ominous, though you can't
put your finger on exactly why; this is the closest
Spielberg comes to channeling Kubrick.
David comes with an imprinting protocol, a sequence of
words that must be said to him that will seal his love
to his owner forever. If, after imprinting, the owner
decides not to keep the mecha, it must be returned to
its manufacturer for destruction. At first, Monica
doesn't like the idea; David creeps her out by
suddenly appearing everywhere she turns, and the idea
that this is a machine seems always to be in the back
of her mind. Then, almost impulsively, she imprints,
and, in an amazing scene, David calls her "mommy" for
the first time.
Martin regains consciousness. He's Henry and Monica's
"real son," and David isn't spared this information.
Martin sees him as just a cool toy to play with, but
when he sees that his mom is infatuated with this
fancy new "mecha," he sets out to make David seem like
a threat.
After being taunted by kids at Martin's birthday
party, David appeals to Martin for protection and, in
the midst of the chaos, drags him into the pool and
almost drowns him. The next day, under the guise of an
intimate drive through the country, Monica takes David
back to Cybertronics. Only she can't bear to destroy
this mecha that seems so lifelike. So she decides to
leave him in the woods with his talking teddy bear and
let him fend for himself.
This is where my emotions started to run amok. The
scene in the forest is so heartbreaking, so genuine in
its despair that were I a few decades older I may have
had to be wheeled away; I would have cried if I wasn't
so shellshocked both times I watched it. But the scene
is even more powerful when you ask why it was so
affecting. After all, David isn't a real boy, but a
machine. So isn't it like leaving a toaster in the
woods, or a microwave? This is the genius of
Spielberg's work here. He isn't going for pure
manipulation; he plays with your emotions and then
prods you to consider why you felt the way you did.
A.I. then shifts in tone completely, as David is
caught by a local "Flesh Fair," a "celebration of
life" in which robots are flamboyantly destroyed on
stage, under the guise of "destroying artificiality."
The head of the fair, played by Brendan Gleeson,
shouts that these mechas were made to replace humans,
and the film's ending proves him right.
David spends the rest of the movie searching for the
Blue Fairy, a character from Pinnochio, which he
overheard when Monica read it to Martin. He wants to
become a real boy so that his mommy will love him
again. His companions are Teddy and Gigolo Joe (Jude
Law), a single-minded, runaway lover robot. Joe was
Kubrick's idea, considerably toned down by Spielberg.
The film is insanely ambitious and brave. It dares to
regard the human race as a petty distraction in the
grand scheme of things, and to view existence as a
state of mind rather than flesh and blood. Why do we
claim to have a monopoly on consciousness and emotion?
If we make a computer program that learns, feels and
reasons, how do you distinguish it from the structure
of our brain which is similarly programmed by instinct
and genetics?
In his third act, Spielberg fearlessly jumps 2000
years into the future, with a denoument that combines
unabashed sentimentality with an undercurrent of
darkness. Critics who gripe that Spielberg compromised
Kubrick's vision with a trademark happy ending
couldn't be farther off the mark; the conclusion is
chilling, recalling Kubrick's own cryptic last act of
2001: A Space Oddyssey. No matter how you interpret
A.I.'s last few seconds, they are the result -- or the
continuation -- of a robot boy's dream, a dream that
could never have come true in the world that created
David.
A.I. is anchored by an amazing Haley Joel Osment, who
again brings with him the emotional maturity most
"adult" actors can only wish for. Jude Law, in his
showiest role to date, is by turns hilarious and
devastating as the troubled sexbot, and Frances
O'Connor gives a courageous performance in what's
likely to be one of the year's most despised roles.
I suppose it's not hard to see why American audiences
have resisted and rejected A.I., though it is
disheartening. It's Spielberg's most serious, most
profound, most adult film; it's also his strangest.
Moviegoers were confused by the daffy third act, and
hard-pressed to see the point of it all. If you had
that reaction, I think you should see it again; it's
amazing how much becomes clear on second viewing.
This is the kind of movie that stays with you. Weeks
after seeing it, I can't shake it. The image that has
haunted me the most isn't the shockingly cruel scene
in the woods, or the powerful conclusion, but Gigolo
Joe's simple, stunning statement of existence. "I am.
I was."

Review for Stir of Echoes (1999)
Starring Kevin Bacon, Kathryn Erbe, Illeana Douglas. Rated R.
And so the horror craze of 1999 continues. The audience is hungry for
more fright-fests and Hollywood is more than ready to deliver them.
David Koepp, screenwriter of such flashy nothings as The Lost World and
Mission: Impossible is the latest to take a stab at this most lucrative
of genres and his Stir of Echoes is entertaining and, for the first time
this year, scary, though far too conventional. There have already been
complaints about the film Echoing The Sixth Sense and they are not all
together incorrect, though Stir of Echoes is a far more light-hearted
effort than its poignant predecessor.
Kevin Bacon's "center of the movie universe" status (popularized by the
"Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" party game, in which a player would try to
connect Bacon to another actor in six movies or less) has been fading,
of late, what with this being only his second "major" motion picture
since Sleepers in 1996 (unless you count Picture Perfect, but you'd have
to be insane). This is probably a step down from Wild Things in clout,
but certainly a step up in quality.
Bacon plays Tom Witzky, a Chicago electrician, living with his wife (the
magnificent, though heretofore inconspicuous Kathryn Erbe) and his young
son. He notices that his son talks to someone who isn't there (in fact,
this is the basis for a staggeringly effective opening scene) but passes
it off, until something happens that opens his eyes. Now, Tom is
introduced as a harshy cynical fella, so when at a party his sister-in-
law starts talking about feats performed with the help of hypnosis, he
dares her to hypnotize him. Not surprisingly it works. Another wonderful
scene, and before we know it, he is out of stasis -- but something isn't
quite right.
He starts seeing visions. Scary visions. Violent visions. They pop up at
the oddest times. Then they disappear. At first Tom is scared, but he
soon becomes curious. Who is his son talking to? What's happening to
that strange girl in his dreams? What's that song he keeps hearing? How
can he make all this go away?
Scream's got nothing on this baby. In terms of jolts, Stir of Echoes is
second to none; a vertable jump-o-rama. In that sense, this is the first
"scary" movie this year: neither Sixth Sense nor The Blair Witch Project
managed this sort of visceral thrill (though these two were going for
psychological suspense rather than "Boo" moments).
Another thing Stir of Echoes has going for it is its unexpectedly witty
script. Not only is it full of one-liners, some generic, some not, but
it also has some funny characters. Tom's new-age sister-in-law has some
truly guffaw-worthy moments, and Tom's own blind determination towards
the end of the film is presented in an unconventionally innocuous way.
The film manages to keep up an extraordinary level of suspense while
maintaining an easy-going and unpretentious attitude. The action is
ominous and somehow gleefully facetious at the same time.
Plot comparisons to The Sixth Sense are not only inevitable, they're
justified. Stir of Echoes can not be faulted for being a "rip-off", per
se, as it was the first of the two to be filmed, but to those not made
aware of that crucial detail, the similarities between the two will seem
suspicious, at best. The most prevalent parallel, of course, is of a
young kid who talks to ghosts. Another: both films involve a murdered
girl whose ghost appears to the main character and wants him to do
something for her. The two movies are so uncannily similar in some
respects that I'm forced to wonder whether the two screenwriters aren't
roommates.
Of course to those (few) who didn't see The Sixth Sense none of this
will matter one bit. Standing on its own, this is pretty good stuff: an
entertaining and reasonably frightening thriller that, quite
shamelessly, makes you laugh and jump almost at the same time. If you
did see Sixth Sense, I'm going to say that this one is only worth paying
to see if you are willing to put the Bruce Willis movie out of your head
for two hours. It isn't a fun experience if you're subconciously forced
to constantly make comparisons to something you've seen before. It also
isn't particularly fair to this gem of a thriller, which, I shall remind
you once more, was filmed before its unwitting companion.

Review for Edtv (1999)
Peruse through Ron Howard's legacy and you'll find few smudges. From the 
titillating Ransom, to the awe-inspiring Apollo 13 and Cocoon, he's 
brought us quality yet unpretentious entertainment through his years as 
a director, a producer and a writer (and who could forget his stint as 
Richie Cunningham on Happy Days?). But everyone of his followers knew 
that, like every great director, he wouldn't be able to keep his lucky 
streak alive forever (remember Steven Spielberg's 1941? Francis Ford 
Coppola's Jack?). As luck would have it, the place where Howard's train 
derails is the moronic new comedy EDtv. Not only does this film have the 
dubious distinction of beating a great concept straight into the ground, 
but it also does it with no dignity whatsoever.20
How does Matthew McConaughey's career continue? He's been universally 
panned, he can't act, and he has single-handedly spoiled (or at least 
reduced the quality of) almost every film I've seen him in. But continue 
his career does, and everyone who sees EDtv will wish that it didn't. He 
stars as Ed, a video store clerk selected by a struggling cable network 
to be on tv 24 hours a day, with his whole life in continuous live 
broadcast. This, of course, involves cameramen following him around 
everywhere he goes, which, understandably, presents some problems for 
him and the people around him.20
At first, Ed jumps at the chance to become famous and wealthy. And for a 
few months he wallows in being begged for autographs, being nationally 
recognized and getting huge bonus payments. He has fun with the 
cameraman who have the unenviable task of staying with him all day and 
all night. But then, things start to get out of whack. His girlfriend 
(Jenna Elfman) dumps him because of lack of privacy. His brother writes 
a book entitled "My Brother Pissed on Me." His family becomes alienated. 
He wants to quit, but will the network let him?20
Of course, this is a great opportunity to present some anti-media social 
commentary. And you know what? This whole thing sounds a bit like that 
little movie that we all saw last year called The Truman Show, doesn't 
it? Yes, comparisons to that masterpiece are inevitable. While Truman 
presents its themes with maturity, subtlety and hilarity, EDtv is 
childish, in-your-face and dull. Truman did not scream "Mass-media is 
bad" at its audience. EDtv pummels the audience with images of people 
shielding their faces from cameras while dramatic music plays. When you 
compare the two films, the latter is almost insulting.20
All of this wouldn't be so bad if the characters were compelling or if 
the film was funny. No such luck. Ed is not even a character but a 
nebulous representation of your everyday, happy-go-lucky guy. 
Unfortunately he is also a total and complete loser. He has no life and 
few friends. He talks like he's drunk and he's not funny or interesting 
in any conceivable way. This makes the already very weak film completely 
collapse. Think of a 2-hour film centered around one person who you'd 
rather not spend 2 hours with, and you'll be thinking of EDtv.20
The failure of Ed the character and EDtv the movie can be at least 
partly blamed on the failure of McConaughey in the lead (what do you 
mean, "What else is new"?). Certainly anyone else (Jim Carrey, for one, 
ridiculous as the suggestion is) could have done at least a slightly 
better job portraying the protagonist of this lame picture, or at least 
as good a job as the god-awful script would permit. The supporting 
actors fare slightly better. Woody Harrelson as the brother whom Ed 
pissed on is equally horrible, but Ellen DeGeneres and Rob Reiner as 
studio executives are occasionally funny.20
This is a very, very bad film. But somehow I feel that there is more at 
stake here than millions of people wasting two hours of their lives. The 
problem is that thanks to EDtv, in the future, any filmmaker that 
attempts a film about a person trapped in a tv world will likely be 
beating a dead horse. The Truman Show presented the concept. 
Pleasantville reinforced it. EDtv grabbed it by the throat and pounded 
it's metaphorical head against the ground

Title
Review for Jurassic Park III (2001)
Starring Sam Neill, William H. Macy, Tea Leoni,
Alessandro Nivola, Trevor Morgan, Michael Jeter, John
Diehl. Directed by Joe Johnston. Rated PG-13.
Jurassic Park III is shameless populist entertainment,
short, breezy, well-made and unpretentious. It's the
epitome of the cliche that is the "popcorn movie."
Free of the scientific and ethical mumbo-jumbo that
polluted the first two installments in the series,
director Joe Johnston, with a prodigious technical
skill that rivals Spielberg's, simply turns on the
dinosaur machine and gives the audience what they
expect from a Jurassic Park movie: a hell of a ride.
Plot and dialogue are likewise formalities Johnston
feels free to dispense with, and for once, it's fine
with me. The movie's skeleton is this: paleontologist
Alan Grant (Sam Neill), the only character returning
from the previous films, is recruited by Mr. and Mrs.
Kirby (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni, uh,
respectively), to be their guide as they fly over Isla
Sorna, the island where genetically engineered
dinosaurs roam free. Grant is extremely reluctant to
do this, as he has been extremely critical of the
experiments that brought the specimens into existence.
So imagine his shock when the Kirbys, who have an
ulterior, if not malevolent, motive, land on the
island without consulting him, leaving them to fend
for themselves in a confined space with huge,
unexpectedly intelligent lizards running around.
Then, with nothing standing in its way, the movie
takes off. The dinosaurs look awesome, with the
special effects team employing a new method of mixing
animatronic reptiles with CGI ones. When a giant
lizard chases the characters, the sight is genuinely
frightening; for the first time, the dinosaurs
actually look gargantuan. Like Spielberg, Johnston
also knows what to do with them; too many movie
special effects just sit there on the screen,
expecting us to be awed by their mere existence. These
dinosaurs do everything we'd expect an actual dinosaur
to do, and there is even a jar of T-Rex urine that
makes an appearance.
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Jurassic Park
III is its running time of less than 90 minutes. A lot
of directors feel that when they are given a lavish
budget, they must make a long movie to justify it (see
The Mummy Returns), and a lot of them wind up feeling
tortuous. Johnston realizes the film's breezy,
thrill-park-ride nature and works accordingly. There
isn't a word, moment or shot wasted; this is the most
stringently utalitarian movie I have ever seen.
The credits roll just about when we would expect the
third act to begin. Though I was having a great time,
this was okay by me. I like suprise endings no matter
the nature of their surprise; others I've talked to
have felt slighted at the lack of a de facto climax,
but their complaints sounded fairly moronic (sorry,
guys). At least you can't call the movie repetitive.
I'm grateful for movies that truly want to entertain,
rather than drown the audience with special effects
and marketing gimmicks. The phrase "popcorn movie"
seems to apply to everything that's not considered an
"art movie," but there's an art to popcorn movies as
well. It is clear, despite the film's simplicity, that
a great deal of work and thought went into all of the
aspects of Jurassic Park III, and not just into the
special effects. Artistry can be found in the
unlikeliest places. 

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
"I said he could stay. That doesn't make him my son."
With the voice talents of Tony Goldwyn, Wayne Knight, Brian Blessed,
Glenn Close, Alex D. Linz. Rated G.
Despite the recent success of pictures like Dreamworks' Antz, Disney
continues to reign as the king of animation. In recent years, it has
found a way to make "cartoons", as they are still affectionately called,
equally accessable to both children and adults. Works like Aladdin
entertained tykes with broader gags while keeping the often unwilling
parents glued to their seat with the razor-sharp wit that has since
become a trademark of Disney animation. The Lion King kept moviegoers of
all ages riveted with the unexpected power of its story (and I'm still
known to hum Hakuna Matata). So it comes as a disappointment that
Disney's latest production contains the least in years to interest
adults. Tarzan is one of the few features from the Mouse that fails to
transcend both age groups.
Loosely adapted from Edgar Rice Burroughs' classic tall-tale, Tarzan is
no longer a novelty, with nearly 50 films sporting some variation on the
legendary Ape Man. Even some of Tarzan's target audience has seen films
like George of the Jungle and have experience with the plot. And that
plot has nearly become a mimeograph, a template for filmmakers to
slightly tinker with and pass off as their own creation. Tarzan is
abandoned by his family in the jungle (due to the family's death),
discovered and raised by apes. Then Tarzan meets Jane, falls in love but
gets in trouble with his ape family as well as some of Jane's malevolent
companions.
With Tarzan, Disney has dared to release their first non-musical feature
in years, wisely keeping the songs being played in the background.
Unfortunately it is also the most non-memorable Disney feature. The
humor that punctuated films like The Lion King and Hercules is virtually
absent from this effort. Furthermore, Tarzan lacks interesting
characters, owing to the fact that Tarzan barely ever speaks. Visually,
this is one of the most impressive animated films to date, but as
Hollywood has discovered the hard way lately, visual flair is hard-
pressed to replace other, more important cinematic qualities. Still,
Tarzan seamlessly blends non-intrusive CGI images with the always
impressive handiwork to make a movie that is a sublimely effective piece
of eye-candy. And it tends to be more aesthetically pleasing to see an
animated Tarzan swinging gracefully through the vines then, say, a live
Johnny Weissmuller do it; he just doesn't have the knack for acrobatics
demonstrated by our animated friend. If nothing else, this new Tarzan is
gloriously devoid of campiness.
To its credit, this Tarzan has the guts to defy animation conventions.
Not only does it omit the redundant showtunes, but the hero doesn't have
a sidekick (what some might perceive as one isn't really a sidekick to
Tarzan; more like a good pal) and the villain has no henchman. It's
refreshing to see a different animated film, but unfortunately Tarzan
leaves out some of the good qualities along with the bad.
The film is voiced rather undistinctively by Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan,
Glenn Close as Tarzan's ape mother, Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's pal and
Lance Henricksen as the skeptical head of the ape family. The only
talent that stands out in Tarzan is that of the delightful Minnie Driver
as Jane; whose deliciouisly sarcastic and often hilarious delivery is
the only one that has a chance of appealing to the more sophisticated.
Family films need to be equally enjoyable to adults and wee ones alike,
thus the "family" moniker. But movies that can be equally alluring to
all age groups are exceedingly rare. Tarzan is superb childrens'
filmmaking, but adults might fare better skipping this surprisingly sub-
par endeavor.

Title
Review for Election (1999)
Starring Matthew Broderick, Reese Witherspoon, Chris Klein. Rated R.
It comes as a walloping disappointment to moi that Election is being
actively marketed as the latest derivative teen flick. Derivative it
ain't, and it isn't a teen flick either, although mature teenagers are
likely to enjoy it. Instead it is a brilliant, biting satire about
crossing the very boundaries of dignity and sacrificing one's career for
something one believes in -- or thinks he believes in.
Matthey Broderick, whom I have never really appreciated as an actor (not
even in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, which I think deserves to be a
classic) finally takes a step in the direction of thespianism. He plays
Jim McCallister, an extraordinary teacher who truly loves his job, loves
his profession, loves his life. His legacy and image are virtually
unscathed, until the latest Student Council Election comes along. You
see, there's this girl named Tracy Flick. She's your perfect example of
a know-it-all over-achiever -- she's the kind of student that is often
the only one to know the answer, leaving the teacher desperately looking
for another student to call on. Tracy is a member of every committee
imaginable; she spends long hours and weekends working on school
projects.
McCallister loathes her with all his heart. Perhaps he is jealous,
perhaps he is simply annoyed by her, but either way when she runs
unopposed for Student Council President, he can't stand to see her win.
He dreads that someday someone like her will rule the country. He is
afraid to imagine what it will be like then. The only thing to do for
him, it seems, is to launch a counter campaign. He singles out Paul
Metzler, a good, popular, albeit slightly slow guy to run against Tracy.
Unfortunately his anger soon leads him to go much farther than that to
prevent Tracy Flick from becoming the next Student Council Prez.
If satire is simply a witty exaggeration of ordinary events, then this
is satire at its brightest. Besides being an effective political satire,
this can be viewed as an affectionate take on what can happen when a
student becomes the pet peeve of an important teacher. But underneath
this is also a serious movie, one about sacrifice and revenge and it
works like a gem, emotionally sincere as well as scathingly funny.
Broderick is brilliant; his character is unabashedly subversive but he
makes him touchingly and unsentimentally sympathetic as well. I look
forward to Broderick doing more movies like this one (unfortunately, his
next project is Inspector Gadget). Reese Witherspoon (Pleasantville) is
not quite as effective, but she does a decent job as well, although
realism isn't one of her strong points in this one.
Those who argue that Election is morally depraved because it puts the
perfectionist Tracy in a bad light are missing the point by a mile.
That's not what this movie is about. It's about anger, it's about
revenge, it's about obsession. Director Alexander Payne's movie is about
important and significant things, and is above and beyond caring whether
it offends a select group of people who have no reason to be offended.
I love this movie. It's a satire that blends hilarity with resonant (but
not overwhelming) moral statements. It's brutal, it's funny, it's
brilliant.

Title
Review for Insider, The (1999)
"That's not the point, whether you tell the truth or not!"
Starring Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer. Rated R.
I don't have too much respect or patience for movies that scream at me.
Subtlety is not always a virtue and many times just putting whatever
you have to say right out on the table is the prudent thing to do. But
an audience shouldn't be forcefed and the themes of the movie shouldn't
be rammed down our throats. Do that and you insult your viewers.
Michael Mann's much lauded "60 Minutes" biopic The Insider succumbs to
the urge to hit the audience as hard as it can with its message. The
film comes on so strong, instead of comprehending what it's trying to
say we reel from it.
Mann is working with one of the year's most impressive casts making
this even more of a disappointment. Our favorite thespian from New
Zealand, Russell Crowe, stars as Jeff Weigand, a chemist who has just
been fired from one of the biggest tobacco companies after working
there for more than a decade. He is forced to sign a confidentiality
agreement requiring him not to share with anyone any information he may
have acquired during his stint at the company. Should he break the
confidentiality agreement, his generous severance package (including
health insurance for his little ones) will be terminated and the
company will commence litigation against him.
In the meantime he is being hounded by Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino),
producer of the popular tv newsmagazine "60 Minutes." Lowell believes,
correctly, that Weigand is an insider with knowledge crucial to public
safety. More specifically, Weigand knows that the tobacco companies are
indeed aware of the addictive and harmful nature of nicotine, a fact
the CEOs passionately denied at a prior hearing.
This is pretty important stuff. Lowell is determined to air Weigand's
testimony, but the tobacco company will stop at nothing to silence him.
They resort to (alleged) death threats against him and his family, a
lawsuit against him and, more importantly, a lawsuit against "60
Minutes" should they decide to air the segment. Basis? Assisting
Weigand in breaking the confidentiality agreement. The lawyer for CBS,
the network in charge of "60 Minutes" advises Lowell and star of the
show Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) that should such a lawsuit be
brought to trial and be successful, the tobacco company may wind up
owning CBS, a possibility which gives the network pause.
Running an exorbitant 157 minutes The Insider manages to entertain for
its first two hours, but runs out of steam towards the end. It's
bloated and self-important, with the apparent conviction that
everything that was shot is too essential to cut. The result is a messy
denoument that muddles and undermines the rest of the movie, which is
for the most part engaging and focused. Since when is it a rule that
Longer is Better? After all, though films of epic length do, for some
reason, tend to dominate the Academy Awards, the two-hour Shakespeare
in Love did, rightfully, beat out the three-hour Saving Private Ryan.
Today's directors need to learn to keep their rambling at a minimum.
What is the movie trying to say? Journalistic integrity is very, very
important. The problem? Well, a) it's not exactly a new and original
idea and b) the film insists on overwhelming us with it. It even goes
so far as having the characters scream this primitive and simplistic
message right into the camera. At the two hour point, I was rapidly
losing my patience and wsa tempted to scream "I got it already!" at the
screen. But The Insider showed no signs of letting up. There will not
be a more redundant movie this year.
Russell Crowe and Al Pacino sure are dynamite. They both give
explosive, occasionally powerful performances, just like I would expect
from two first-rate actors such as this pair. The standout, I think, is
Christopher Plummer who perfectly projects his character's vanity but
also his goodness. If anyone deserves an Oscar nomination for this
inconsistent affair, it would have to be this guy. I can't wait until
his next film (which happens to be Posessed, where he plays a priest).
A little subtlety never hurt anyone. It shouldn't be so subtle that
it's vague but screaming doesn't exactly serve the movie's purpose
either. A film has to hold our attention throughout and deliver its
message in the meantime. Viewer intimidation is not the way to go.

Title
Review for Blair Witch Project, The (1999)
Starring Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams, Joshua Leonard. Rated R.
The Blair Witch Project will go down in the books as one of independent
filmmaking's biggest triumphs because of the extent which it has broken
through to the mainstream. Not only has it gotten an inordinate amount
of unabashedly positive reviews from critics but in its first few weeks
of limited release it has also achieved commercial success of gargantuan
proportions. Whether this $20,000 project can attain box-office bliss by
studio standards remains to be seen, but, if nothing else, it's already
a cult hit.
Popularity is fine, but is the movie any good? That's unrelated to its
Hollywood status and it demands more thoughtful discussion. It's
certainly original -- I've never seen anything like it. But does it have
any cinematic merit? Is it junky fun or is it a serious movie? This is
one of those films, I think, where the answers to all of these questions
are solely in the eye of the beholder -- and that's okay. What seemed to
me clearly true, however, is that this is no masterpiece of American
cinema: it is far too flawed to attain that status even though many fans
and even some critics, who have gone off the deep end, insist the
opposite.
Three student filmmakers -- Heather, Josh and Mike go on a hike into
Maryland woods to film a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local urban
legend. They disappear. A year later their footage is found. The Blair
Witch Project is that footage and nothing but that footage. They film
the whole trip, from the interviews they do with people in a Maryland
town to the hike. When one of them loses the all-important map they are
lost in the middle of nowhere with something mysterious and frightening
on their tail.
Inevitable tensions escalate within the group. Josh and Mike are furious
at Heather for refusing to turn the camera off and and focusing on their
dire situation. Heather and Josh are furious at Mike for apparently
kicking the map into a creek. Their desperation and refusal to cooperate
with each other threatens to destroy them. So, evidently, does the Blair
Witch.
The Blair Witch Project is constantly creepy and occasionally unnerving
but up until the gut-wrenching climax its format prevents it from being
genuinely scary and even then it seems to dilute it somewhat. It's a
grand idea -- making a movie solely filmed with a hand-held camera by
its characters -- but it has its drawbacks. All too often it's slightly
hard to tell what's going on because, understandably, the camera doesn't
stay steady when the people behind it are in hysterics. It's very
difficult to argue that being sure of what's happening is scarier than a
menace unknown, which is why something like The Game or the best of
Hitchcock's stuff is always more frightening than any slasher movie.
Tense anticipation makes the "boo" moment anticlimactic. Still, when the
viewer is utterly confused (which, luckily, happens only in a few
instances here) horror films tend to have less effect.
The dialogue, much of it improvised (the directors sent the actors alone
into the woods to film the movie), surprisingly comes off as realistic.
It's not particularly witty but it seems to resemble what real people
would utter in that kind of situation; it never feels fabricated or
manipulative. Profanity abounds but hey -- would you expect anything
less from three mightily pissed-off young college students?
Some will insist that even adequate execution of such brilliantly
original idea is enough to make this movie a milestone in cinema;
especially horror cinema. I disagree strenuously. It's enjoyable stuff
but folks, it's nothing to write home about. The climax approaches
terrifying and it contains many suspenseful, well-made sequences but by
the same token The Blair Witch Project is inconsistent, confusing and
unevenly paced. In a word (three, actually, but never mind): hit and
miss.
This nifty little film gets off to a slow start (to the extent that is
possible in a film running barely over 80 minutes) and drags through
some of its first half. But when it's going, it's good. Crafty,
visionary and enjoyable, this may not be a masterpiece, but it's a
refreshing digression from the pretension that indie filmmaking tends to
represent and from the horror movie clichés that make this movie's
companions so dull.

Title
Review for Felicia's Journey (1999)
 Starring Bob Hoskins, Elaine Cassidy, Arsinée Khanjian. Rated PG-13.
There are many superficial similarities between Atom Egoyan's flawed
but resonant new movie Felicia's Journey and his 1997 critical smash
The Sweet Hereafter, but the two films are fundamentally different.
Hereafter was a concept movie, dealing with the idea of grief after a
tragedy. Felicia's Journey is nothing of the sort. It's a character
movie, one that plunges into the deepest, darkest depths of human
nature. The main character is a serial killer and yet the killings are
never shown; the movie is not about them.
Young, naive, pregnant Felicia comes to Great Britain from Ireland in
search of her lover, who has reportedly gone away to serve in the army.
He promised Felicia he would write every day, but she has not heard a
word from him since he left. The only information she has came from a
friend of a friend, and that is that he works in a lawnmower factory.
She wonders around England's industrial midlands in search of
Wonderboy; she is instead taken in by Joseph Ambrose Hilditch (Bob
Hoskins), who obligingly assists her in her search but has dark
ulterior motives himself.
You see, Hilditch has murdered a number of young women. They were all
lonely young things, undergoing major crises. He preyed on their
emotions and when they tried to leave, he killed them. Hilditch himself
doesn't know he did it: he remembers the girls, but not the crimes. He
obsessively follows along with tapes of his classy mother's old cooking
shows, where he, as a child was the co-star -- whenever his mother
needed someone to humiliate.
Meanwhile, Hilditch takes steps to make sure Felicia stays by his side
and she never suspects him for a moment. Felicia's Journey develops
into a suspense thriller that uses drastically untraditional methods to
generate that suspense: no quickening of the pace, no dramatic swells
of the soundtrack to indicate something exciting happening. The result
is, unfortunately, an effective drama but not much of a thriller. We're
involved, emotionally and viserally, but never particularly, um,
thrilled. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
One of Egoyan's more tangible fallacies here is the film's first 45
minutes. He limps out of the starting line with a deadly slow first
third, to the point where I had almost given up on the movie by the
time things got interesting. It's a well-known fact that non-mainstream
directors like to take their time, but isn't grabbing the audience's
attention immediately one of the first rules of filmmaking?
Fortunately, once things get interesting, they really get interesting.
The performances quickly develop into rich, deep characterizations and
the plot becomes intricate and involving. Egoyan is a craftsman, one of
the most effectively subtle directors in the business. His films take
on an eerie quality of a whole other level running beneath the main
storyline. We get glimpses of it once in a while, through character
revelations, script allusions, et al -- or we think we do -- but for
the most part it remains hidden from us. Of course, it may not even
exist, but in that case Egoyan's deliberate, mystical style is sure
good at making us imagine it.
The ending of Felicia's Journey is a tour de force. At that point,
everything becomes clear and you realize just how good everything that
preceded it was. It creates the temptation to go back and watch the
movie again (something I plan to do, since I have the video) to learn
more about Joseph Ambrose Hilditch.
I do wish the character of Felicia was more of a person than a concept.
She barely even has dialogue and, as a result, never fully becomes
human. Thus, we can't identify with her and the film's protagonist
becomes the serial killer himself, something that should turn off
audiences. It also makes the title kinda strange -- this is hardly
Felicia's journey. The movie ceases to be about her as soon as we see
Hilditch's first cooking scene.
I'm not as enthusiastic about this movie as I was about The Sweet
Hereafter because it's rougher around the edges. The film "wakes up" in
its last 20 minutes, but there is no reason why the whole movie
couldn't have been as rich and as complex as those final moments. But I
won't complain too much. Go see this one.

Title
Review for What's the Worst That Could Happen? (2001)
Starring Martin Lawrence, Danny De Vito, John
Leguizamo, Glenne Headly, Bernie Mac, Nora Dunn,
William Fichtner. Directed by Sam Weisman. Rated
PG-13.
What's the Worst That Could Happen? sneaks up on you.
It starts out direly, then unexpectedly gains
momentum, finally surviving on the charisma of star
Martin Lawrence and the experience of co-star Danny De
Vito. There's nothing brilliant here, but enough funny
throwaway gags for the film to just squeak by and pass
itself off as "entertaining." It strings together
conventions in an amusing way. Perhaps the best praise
I can give this movie is that I was rarely bored.
Martin Lawrence, who has starred as a criminal in four
out of his last five movies, plays Kevin Caffrey, a
professional thief. He and his partner-in-crime,
played by John Leguizamo, rob a house owned by Max
Fairbanks (Danny De Vito). Fairbanks was ordered to
stay away from the mansion by a bankrupcy judge, but,
never one to obey something as frivolous as a court
order, he goes there anyway with his Playboy
centerfold girl-toy. He catches Caffrey red-handed
and, as the thief is being handcuffed by the police,
he steals Caffrey's lucky ring simply by saying that
it's his. It's the millionaire's word against the
crook's, and who's kidding who?
Caffrey will do anything to get his ring back, but
Fairbanks is convinced that, since the ring
coincidentally has his company's old logo on it, it's
his lucky ring. Bernie Mac plays the stolen goods
dealer who tries to help him. Wildly inconsistent
chaos ensues.
Lawrence is an extremely talented comedian, who has
risen above his material and rescued his films from
the gutter on many occasions. But he can't seem to
carry this one, which may explain why the opening
scenes have a clunky feel. Whenever he is on screen by
himself or with his love interest, the movie up and
dies. But whenever De Vito, Bernie Mac or William
Fichtner are on screen -- the latter hysterical as
slightly feminine detective Alex Tardio -- What's the
Worst That Could Happen? suddenly picks up steam.
Perhaps this is because Kevin Caffrey isn't a terribly
interesting character. He's the stereotypical "thief
with a conscience" that we always see in sappy movies
like this; he falls in love with a girl who thinks
that he is a "businessman" and swears to reform, but
something happens and he has to continue on his
less-than-righteous path. That's really all there is
to him, which isn't much to laugh at.
The point at which I realized that I was enjoying
myself came when Max Fairbanks was testifying before
Congress. Provoked, he suddenly starts spouting
profanities at the distinguished lawmakers. A dumber
movie would have left it at that -- look, he's cursing
at stiff high-class types! -- but What's the Worst
That Could Happen?, in what may have been its single
stroke of near-brilliance, also includes a
sign-language interpreter who gets a little carried
away. That's Stephanie Clayman, by the way, as the
iterpreter; I've never seen her before, but will look
for her in the future.
What can I say about a movie like this? It's not
inspired, it's not consistent, it's doesn't have a
terribly good script. But it's well-acted, it has some
good gags, and it held my attention for 97 minutes. I
can't ask much more of a movie from which I expected
so much less. 

Title
Review for Mickey Blue Eyes (1999)
"Here's a painting by one of our newest artists. It's entitled 'Die
Piggy Piggy Die Die"
Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Burt Young. Rated
PG-13.
Hollywood actors with strong British accents and no desire to master an
American one will have trouble getting roles that don't involve playing
an Englishman in America. This has led to the constant typecasting of
talents like Hugh Grant who always ends up playing the bumbling Brit in
romantic comedies when he is likely capable of so much more. Thus his
performances have become excruciatingly predictable. As many have
pointed out, Hugh Grant is a great personality and an even better screen
presence. A shame his personality and presence are precisely the same in
nearly every film he does.
Mickey Blue Eyes is a romantic comedy but it is also a spoof of
organized crime. It is not the outright parody that Mafia! was and it
takes its story very seriously but the script certainly has a satirical
edge. Grant plays Michael Felgate, a New York auctioneer who is madly in
love with Gina Vitale (Jeanne Tripplehorn). He finds an elaborate way of
proposing marriage to her. It backfires, but when he does get around to
asking her to marry him she breaks into tears and runs away.
Why? Mike finds out that she is part of a mafioso family. Most of her
relatives have spent time in jail at some point in their lives and are
still very much mobsters. Gina insists that shoe can't marry him because
it will get him involved in her family's dealings. They do you one
favor, she says, and you're indebted to them forever.
Eventually Gina gives in and the couple weds, but only after Michael
solemnly swears that he will not get involved with her family. He does,
of course. The mob scratches his back and he is forced to scratch back.
They (Gina's father, played by James Caan, her uncle the mob boss
portrayed by Burt Young and others played by Joe Viterelli and John
Ventimiglia) get Michael involved in a money laundering scheme by making
Michael auction off various paintings of theirs, making people that owe
them money buy those paintings and making Michael hand over the money.
This gets Michael in some trouble with the FBI who are wise to the
mobsters' schemes.
Scripted by Adam Scheinman (Little Big League) and Robert Kuhn (The
Cure, an underrated 1995 gem) and directed by Kids in the Hall veteran
Kelly Makin, Mickey Blue Eyes is a tremendously funny movie. The jabs at
the mafia are not as in-your-face as they were in Mafia! but they are
twice as witty and twice as entertaining. A few, indeed, garnered none
other than belly laughs from me, which took me by surprise because what
I had expected least from this movie is the do-anything-for-a-laugh
attitude it employed.
The highlight of this energetic romp has to be the brilliant, knee-
slapping turn by the often humorless James Caan (Eraser). Everything he
tries with his deadpan performance works and the result is comedy bliss.
Hugh Grant is equally effective; he manages to be funny even though he
is playing the same role he's played in countless movies. The only weak
link in the cast is Jeanne Tripplehorn who manages to make her character
bitchy for 99% of her screen time. Why would Hugh Grant want to marry
her again?
It's a shame that the romance disappears for most of the middle portion
of the film to make room for Michael's mafia antics. Funny as those may
be, if this is the romantic comedy that Warner is oh-so-feverishly
trying to promote, why not make the romance a central part of the
picture? That worked so well in Notting Hill.
The ending of the movie is far too convenient and too cloying, but
everything leadiing up to it is a comic delight. Affectionate, hilarious
and light as a feather, Mickey Blue Eyes may not be the movie of the
year but it's an entertaining -- if instantly forgettable -- diversion.

Title
Review for Musketeer, The (2001)
Starring Justin Chambers, Mena Suvari, Stephen Rea,
Tim Roth, Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Peter Hyams.
Rated PG-13.
Alexander Dumas' The Three Musketeers is one of the
most often-adapted literary works, and for good
reason: the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just
a story. Perhaps The Musketeer, a new film that
"reimagines" the novel in the spirit and style of The
Matrix, is one adaptation too many. It's just awful:
spiritless, silly and unforgivably boring,
transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of
old-as-time clichés and incoherent, repetitive action
sequences.
This time, D'Artagnan is played by Calvin Klein model
Justin Chambers, who can't even pronounce his
character's name. As a boy, he watched his father get
killed by Febre (Tim Roth), a lackey of power-hungry
Cardinal Richelieu. He vowed to have vengeance. After
undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman,
he goes looking for his enemy.
On his quest, he embroils himself in a struggle for
control at the highest levels of the French
government. The Royal Musketeers have lost their
gusto, what with their jobs being taken over by the
Cardinal's own guards. Only a few loyal swashbuckers
remain, among them Athos and Portos (who are only
figureheads in this movie). Together with D'Artagnan,
they fight to extricate the Queen (Catherine Deneuve)
from the traps that Febre and Richelieu are trying to
plant. Oh, and as an afterthought, D'Artagnan falls in
love with the poor maid at the local inn (Mena
Suvari). Just thought I'd mention that.
Now, look: I don't know whose idea this was, but
whoever is responsible deserves a severe
tongue-lashing. I have nothing against "modernizing"
classic works of literature - at the very least, they
can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but
films as dull as this have no positive side effects.
Director Peter Hyams, known for such masterpieces of
modern cinema as Timecop and End of Days, has
jettisoned everything that was great about Dumas'
masterwork: the sense of excitement, cause, and
camaraderie. Instead, we get impressively
choreographed but somehow vacuous, uninvolving action
sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to
nothing. When the musketeers finally get to holler
"All for one, and one for all," I could have sworn
that was Dumas rolling in his grave that I felt.
Maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here
is the Hyams's tone, which is unreasonably dark and
brooding when you consider the Reader's Digest
condensed version of the story that he gives us. It's
as though anything that may have been construed as
"fun" was purposely expunged from the production. The
joylessness of the proceedings, from the oppressively
shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes, can be
felt in every frame.
Chambers can't act; Suvari, Roth and Deneuve can, but
aren't given the chance. And when push comes to shove,
the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious,
though at least Roth gets to play a villain without
having to wear an ape suit.
Some movies seem sloppy and careless, clearly made for
a quick buck. With The Musketeer we get the sense that
it was meticulously crafted to be awful. The film is
intricate, stylish and precise, hitting the wrong note
every single time. 

Title
Review for Bandits (2001)
"Mexico? You know I have sanitation issues!"
Starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate
Blanchett. Rated PG-13.
Bandits is a fun, uninhibited little comedy, with a
plot that's a red herring for the bizarre wit of its
dialogue. It also offers the rare sight of Billy Bob
Thornton aping Woody Allen, as well as Cate Blanchett
doing physical comedy. How great to see a mainstream
film that revels in writing and little character
moments rather than trying to overwhelm us with
overwrought action and story. Its attempts at "heart"
and any other form of significance are quickly and
cruelly dashed, but there are images here that are so
strange, I won't soon forget them.
The film was directed by Barry Levinson, a remarkably
versatile director who has experimented with nearly
every genre one could imagine and his results have
ranged from abominable to incredible. Here, he's
assembled two great character actors and one great
leading man and sticks them into a plot that
compensates for its conventionality with sublime
ridiculousness. There's also an oddball structure:
Bandits begins with what seems to be the title
characters' last crime, then fast forwards to a
reality crime show where it is announced that the
"Sleepover Bandits" died in a shootout immediately
following it.
The next scene goes back to the beginning, as Joe
(Bruce Willis) and Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) escape
from prison by hijacking a cement truck and driving it
through numerous chain-link fences. After they're sure
that they have lost their pursuers, Joe proceeds to
rob a bank with a magic marker. Later, as they're
stealing new clothes from a random house, Terry comes
up with the perfect bank robbery: do it early in the
morning, with the full cooperation of the bank manager
whom they kidnapped the night before.
Back up. To explain my fascination with this seemingly
formulaic heist flick, I need to describe the
personalities of the two partners-in-crime. Joe is
actually a fairly "regular" (in the Hollywood sense)
criminal: fast-thinking, charming, charismatic and
cocky. But Terry, ooooh boy. He's intelligent and
pragmatic, but his positive qualities are far
outshadowed by his unbelievable neurosis. One of his
phobias is antique furniture, and he doesn't want to
escape to Mexico because of "sanitation issues."
If it seems impossible for Blanchett to somehow wedge
her way into this story, it is, which is why Levinson,
consistent with the tone of the rest of the script,
gives her a completely non sequitur entrance before
actually integrating her with our protagonists. She
plays a neglected housewife who accidentally winds up
tagging along with our sleepover bandits and falls in
love with both of them. I don't think I need to
mention (but I will anyway) that she is the source of
all of their problems.
Certain scenes here are pure comedic gold. The problem
with reviewing the film is that it is impossible to
convey the humor, or even the spirit, of those scenes
in words. Suffice it to say that while little here
would be funny if taken out of context, seeing
Blanchett's character try to scare Terry out of a
sneezing fit is one of the funniest things I have seen
in a long time.
It's strange, at first, to see the A-list stars and
director devote their time to what is doubtlessly an
exercise in frivolity. Lately it becomes clear: rarely
has so much talent been dedicated to writing such
frivolity. Bandits is absurd, rambling, and very, very
funny. 

Title
Review for Jakob the Liar (1999)
 "I DON'T HAVE A RADIO!"
Starring Robin Williams, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Alan Arkin, Liev
Schreiber. Rated PG-13.
Robin Williams has the rarest of gifts: the ability to rise above the
most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style.
Overwhelmingly, his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and
enjoyable at best (with the notable exception of Flubber). So when I,
the one person who has refused to abandon him despite Patch Adams, tell
you that not even Williams can save his latest project, you know it's in
trouble. Jakob the Liar is a confused, muddled little movie; a
generically "uplifting" film with a fundamental contradiction: the
message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie
doesn't realize it.
Williams plays Jakob Haim, a Jew imprisoned in a Polish ghetto during
World War II. One night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly
sent to the office of a high-ranking German officer for his punishment.
Jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a
radio broadcast. The announcement (in English, but punctuated by a
triumphant "Heil Hitler!") is that Russian troops are only miles away
from Jakob's ghetto. Liberation! he thinks. The next day, Jakob tells
the news to his closest friend, a volatile prize fighter named Misha
(Liev Schreiber), who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message
along.
Soon, it is a common assumption in the ghetto that Jakob has a radio
hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death. This is absurdly
false, but the more Jakob tells the people of the ghetto this, the more
convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in
the war that is to decide their fate. The danger, of course, is that the
Germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto, and rumors
about the radio can get out and put Jakob in great danger.
In a curiously irrelevant subplot, Jakob finds a 11-year old girl who
has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small
home. Apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered, and goes to
great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is
never made clear. He and the girl build an uninvolving, generic
relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as
it was in the beginning.
The moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine. But Jakob the
Liar forgets that the hope that Jakob brings to his ghetto is false.
Such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when
those expectations aren't met, the results are far worse than if there
was no hope. That's the film's biggest detriment: it is based on a false
assumption and thus comes off as painfully false. It's never moving
because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by. Jakob the Liar fails
to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing.
Robin Williams doesn't inject the film with life, as a matter of fact,
he seems a little out of it, as if crippled by his fake accent. He is
stragely unenthusiastic; his character is one who spreads hope but his
performance is lifeless, hopeless. Not since Good Will Hunting has he
abandoned his signature style to this extent; this isn't the Robin
Williams we know and love. In Good Will Hunting he became a serious
actor and won an Oscar for it. Here, he is more of a wannabe serious
actor; an impostor.
Jakob the Liar will be compared with last year's Life is Beautiful
because it is being marketed as a "Holocaust comedy". It's not a comedy.
It tries, sometimes, but it rarely works. Is it a melodrama? A war
movie? A character study? No, no, and no. Jakob the Liar is the kind of
movie that can't be placed into a category; not because it covers so
many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it
attempts.

Review for Lost & Found (1999/I)
Lost and Found (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/lostandfound.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring David Spade, Sophie Marceau. Rated PG-13.
In many comedies, energy is everything. The quickness of the pace, the feel
of the script and the gusto of the stars can make or break a comedy. A movie
with energy can easily involve the audience in the action, while a film
lacking it has to work harder to obtain momentum in other areas. Energy is
especially important if a movie lacks some of the other qualities necessary
for a good comedy, such as originality, or a solid script. Sheer energy is
where David Spade's new vehicle Lost and Found almost overcomes its many
faults. Most of David Spade's major movie roles have come as a
"second-stringer", usually surrendering the spotlight to two-time co-star
Chris Farley, in movies such as the cult hit Tommy Boy and the despicable
Black Sheep. The untimely death of Farley and the fact that Spade is just a
very funny guy, finally earned him a starring role, and it's a doozie. He
plays Dylan, a struggling restaraunt owner who falls for his beautiful new
neighbor, Lila. The problem is that while he's a pop-culture American, she
speaks five languages and is a professional (although career-less) celloist
and she's got a cocky ex-husband who tags along and is determined to compete
with Dylan for her, although she tends not to like him. So to get the upper
hand, Dylan decides to steal her dog, in the hopes that he, benevolent as he
is, could look for it with her, and that she'd get to like him. He was only
planning on it being a few hours, tops, and then he would return the dog and
be a hero. But the dog eats his brother's diamond engagement ring that he
asked Dylan to keep, so now returning the animal is out of the question. He
must wait until the dog passes the ring out. The only problem: Lila's
conniving ex finds out about Dylan keeping the dog and wants to expose him as
the jackass that he is.
Indeed, the film elicits quite a few laughs during its short running time,
many of them thanks to the divinely funny David Spade, whose ordinary guy
charm not only gets his character out of many compromising situations but
also engages us in him and the movie's mediocre script. And the climactic
scene, which I will not reveal except to say that it is an odd ode to Neil
Diamond, featured Spade -- for the first time in his movie career -- being
daring.
Unfortunately, we've seen all of this before. Much of Lost and Found was
clearly inspired by the success of last year's There's Something About Mary,
with the same kind of humorous dog abuse (if such a thing exists) and raunchy
humor. The subplot about trying to save the business by catering a big party
is straight out of the box-office flop (but cinematic success) Simply
Irresistible. Sucking up to the banker to obtain a loan is also nothing new.
David Spade manages to squeeze a serviceable amount of laughs out of tired
devices, but face it, it's not as funny the second time.
This would be forgiveable if only Lost and Found was as sap-less as There's
Something About Mary or Simply Irresistible. Unfortunately director Jeff
Pollack settles for that old hanky (panky?) ending, complete with a heart-
wrenchingly lame apology, followed by a jokey line of acceptance, the
obligatory kiss, immediately followed by the vomit on the person sitting in
front of me. It never fails to disgust me how modern filmmakers are always
willing to insert the "couple reunion" conclusion into so many comedies. I
think audiences are too smart to fall for that anymore. The formula is no
longer a hanky-fest, it's a cringe-fest for nearly everyone watching.
It's a shame that David Spade's exuberant efforts are wasted, because he
can't quite save this comedy, although he sure comes close. I choose to look
at this as a sign of a bright future for a talented comedian, rather than a
complete waste. If more people see this movie the way I do, perhaps we've
found our next Jim Carrey.

Review for Lola rennt (1998)
With the abundance of trite, recycled movies in the late '90s, there is a
tremendous demand by movie lovers (never mind movie critics) for movies that
present the wide film audience with something truly original: perhaps
audaciously, perhaps purely thematically. For the former, you need look no
further than director Tom Tykwer's incredible German thriller Run Lola Run, a
movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards. Lola,
a contemporary Goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone
call from her boyfriend Manni one day. It seems that because she was late
delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand Marks, and
if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty
minutes, he will be killed. This gives Lola twenty minutes to come up with
100,000 marks, or her boyfriend dies. So she runs -- not just jogs, sprints
-- in hopes that somehow, someway, she'll be able to obtain the money and
save a life.
>From there, as critic Steve Rhodes described it, Run Lola Run plays a bit
like "Sliding Doors on steroids. With a non-stop techno soundtrack, wierd
camerawork, all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace, anyone that
is bored with Run Lola Run has to be smoking something. Indeed, the movie is
often outrageously exciting, as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious.
Very much like Titanic, Run Lola Run is an achievement with filmmaking much
more than it is an achievement in film. The way the movie is made, for pure
visual style, Tykwer's movie is breathtaking (literally, sometimes).
Thematically it does leave something to be desired; it toys around with some
intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance
behind all of the flash.
While you are watching, this will not matter. Running a breezy 81 minutes,
this is one movie I wished was longer because it was so damn good while it
lasted. It is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and
fun that it offers. Š1999 Eugene Novikov

Review for Mummy, The (1999)
Starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah. Rated PG-13.
I cherish energy in a movie. I cherish genuine wit even in the most
unlikely places. I cherish escapist fare that truly deserves that name -
- a movie that makes even the most critical of viewers forget it's own
faults (as well as the viewer's own troubles, if only for two hours),
sit back and enjoy. The Mummy is a movie I cherish.
The Mummy, believe it or not, is actually a remake of a 1932 horror film
of the same name and starring Boris Karloff. It is not a horror flick.
It's about a super-cool adventurer named O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) who
leads a young librarian (Rachel Weisz) and her brother (John Hannah) in
search of a forbidden Egyptian city. When they find it (quite easily, I
might add), the librarian screws up. She reads from a forbidden book and
that, you see, wakes up The Mummy (Aaron Vosloo), who has been stuck in
a tomb for thousands of years, has been given the powers to bring
horrible plagues on Egypt and needs human flesh and blood to regenerate.
>From the moment The Mummy awakens, director Stephen Sommers's (Deep
Rising) film goes into hyperdrive. It becomes a non-stop tirade of
special effects, action scenes and jokes. Damned if it doesn't work.
Throughout, The Mummy maintains a contageous sort of glee, a sense of
almost self-ridiculing facetiousness. It is the kind of movie where when
someone asks someone else what to do because the boat has been sabotaged
and is burning down, the other person responds "Stay here, I'll get
help" and jumps overboard. It's the kind of movie where the main
characters are constantly in jeopardy and yet the movie almost tells us
"Don't worry about them, look at that awesome wall of sand!"
Most of The Mummy is utter nonsense. Not only does the plot not make
sense, but the movie doesn't even make any attempts to justify it. This
is not a plot movie. All that matters is how the characters try to
escape their situation -- not even whether they escape, but how they go
about doing it. It's an excuse to showcase some eye-popping imagery, but
it's also a hell of a lot of fun.
The performances from Vosloo, Weisz and Fraser are barely worth
mentioning because they don't matter. I'm sure that their performances
are satisfactory, but if Stephen Sommers and his screenwriters could
have gotten rid of characters all together, they probably would have, so
the wall of sand could be the official star of the movie. The only
performance that bears any significance in The Mummy is that of John
Hannah -- the script has some ingeniously funny scenes reserved for him,
some of them eliciting applause from the audience (myself included).
There is a lot in this movie to hate. Cinematically, it's a piece of
crap. However, no human should be bored. Most should be greatly
entertained.
You have to get yourself in the right state of mind to enjoy this
picture. Don't look at it as a movie; view it rather as an outrageously
entertaining theme park ride. If you're not willing to strap yourself in
and drop your cinematic pretentions at the door -- don't go.

Title
Review for Angela's Ashes (1999)
Starring Robert Carlyle, Emily Watson, Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens, Michael
Legge. Directed by Alan Parker. Rated R.
Few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as
Alan Parker's adaptation of Frank McCourt's memoir Angela's Ashes. Many
dismissed it as an humorless, sentimentalized, uninteresting version of
the hugely popular novel; others hailed it as a heartfelt, sincere
portrait of the human spirit. I'm somewhere in between, leaning
strongly towards the latter. It's certainly well-made and it never
becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be.
But I have a feeling that Parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical
shots of rain falling on the homely streets of Ireland just so it can
have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "I'm important!"
McCourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving
from the US to Ireland in the early 1900's, a time when most people
were desperately trying to get into the US. As he comments, "we were
the only Irishfolk to say goodbye to the Statue of Liberty." In
Ireland, Frank (played by Joe Breen as a small child), his 3 brothers,
his mother Angela (Emily Watson) and his father Malachy (Robert
Carlyle) get financial help from Angela's mother, a stereotypically
strict Catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a Northern
Irishman.
She helps them get a rat-infested apartment and Malachy goes looking
for a job. Positions are scarce and when he does finally find one, he
is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking.
Meanwhile, Frank goes to an uptight Catholic school, where the
instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their
heart desires. Two of Frank's brothers soon die, crippled by the
dreadful living conditions and malnutrition. As if the poverty and the
suffering weren't intense enough as it stood, Malachy and Angela have
another baby, worsening the situation further.
I imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot. That's probably
because it isn't one. These are people. This is their story. Director
Alan Parker (The Commitments) knows how to tell a good story and
Angela's Ashes, despite its relentlessly literary tone remains
interesting. Though the film occasionally indulges too much in its
gloomily picturesque Irish setting, it avoids looking like a glorified
travelogue.
Supplementing Parker's able direction are the engaging, often poignant
performances of the leads, some of them seasoned thespians, others
relative beginners. Carlyle, the charismatic British actor who has
shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick
comedy to the villain in a James Bond movie and now to sentimental
melodrama, perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character. We
empathize with the guy, but we don't like or admire him. Emily Watson
turns in a heartfelt, sincere supporting performance. It is mostly she
who implants that lump in our throats. Also worthy of mention is little
Joe Breen, whose face graces the film's superb poster. It is Breen's
first feature film and he's extraordinary as young Frank. Not unlike
sudden Oscar darling Haley Joel Osment of The Sixth Sense, you can peer
into the character's soul through Breen's sad eyes.
On the flip side, one thing that could have vastly improved Angela's
Ashes is a more decisive editor. While Gerry Hambling sure makes the
most of the scenery, he and Parker also leave in at least a half an
hour of unnecessary footage. The first half, especially, could have
been trimmed down, bringing the film to a more reasonable running time
and doing our bladders a favor in the process. Things pick up at about
the halfway point, sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms I
accumulated during the opening hour, but I maintain that the
aggressively deliberate pace Parker and Co. set in the first half was
ludicrously unnecessary.
*Spoiler Warning! Skip next paragraph if in suspense!*
The film's final message is somewhat conflicted, as Frankie, in effect,
leaves his family famished in Ireland while he himself goes back to
America. What, exactly, are we supposed to make of that? His mother
doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her
son, as any mother would, but it still seems inconsiderate of him. I
haven't read the book, but I'm sure that McCourt justifies his actions
therein; therefore, I'm suspicious. Another thing that's never made
clear in the movie is the meaning of the title, which, I'm sure, is
also explained in the memoir.
If seen as a film onto itself, rather than an adaptation, Angela's
Ashes stands tall. Despite a few minor setbacks, it is a captivating
story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society
where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the
financial ladder.

Title
Review for Ninth Gate, The (1999)
Starring Johnny Depp, Frank Langella, Emmanuelle Seigner, Lena Olin.
Directed by Roman Polanski. Rated R.
I saw Roman Polanski's The Ninth Gate right after Final Destination,
and I'd be lying if I said that these circumstances didn't affect my
judgment at least a little bit. Many will argue that comparing the two
would be comparing apples and oranges because they are so superficially
different but I'd say that they have more in common than meets the eye.
After all, they have the same intention: to generate suspense and evoke
occasional laughs. So why does The Ninth Gate succeed while its more
mainstream counterpart fails? Because instead of relying on mayhem and
explosions, Polanski's superb supernatural thriller uses quiet,
building tension. By the time the ending comes around, I realized that
a) the time has flown by and b) I've moved precariously close to the
edge of my seat.
The movie has a mustached, older-looking Johnny Depp as Dean Corso, a
bibliophile specializing in extremely old and rare books. He does a lot
of mundane, regular stuff like appraisal and not-terribly-exciting
searches. He also has a few employers who expect more. One of these
employers is the creepy Boris Balkan, who has a gargantuan collection
of ancient volumes all having one thing in common: Satan is the main
character.
Dean has done things for Balkan in the past and has been paid
handsomely, but this time Boris has a special assignment for him. He
has one very special book, said to conceal the secret to unleashing the
devil's powers. Conveniently, it was written in 1666. There are three
surviving copies. Dean is to go to Europe and seek out the other two in
order to verify that Boris's is the real deal and not a phony.
The Ninth Gate is probably the most intense movie experience I've had
since Arlington Road, which is remarkable because there is not a whole
lot of action. The movie was quiet and slow, yet the excitement kept
building. This is partly because the plot is so inherently interesting -
- as Dean Corso begins to uncover the secrets of the mysterious book,
we're with him every step of the way, just as curious as he is. It also
has to do with controversial director Roman Polanski's masterful
plotting and staging of scenes. An example (minor spoiler ahead, skip
to next paragraph if you don't want it): in France, Dean meets up with
an enigmatic woman, who seems to pop up everywhere he goes in the most
opportune circumstances. At one point, we see her fly. Dean does not. A
lesser director would have punctuated the scene with loud music,
heavenly choruses, et al. Polanski stages it matter-of-factly; it's a
surprise made all the more creepy by the fact that it's not highlighted
in any way. Blink and you'll miss it.
When people talk about Johnny Depp, especially with negative
connotations, I always suggest that they watch The Astronaut's Wife and
Sleepy Hollow back to back to get a sense of the actor's astonishing
range. Now, I add The Ninth Gate to that list. He's a veritable
chameleon (a title usually reserved for the deserving, though less
daring, Edward Norton) and it's unbelievable to me that he has never
received an Oscar nomination. Here we see yet another side of him. His
performance is more subtle, not as distinctive, but that doesn't make
it any less impressive or engaging.
The one thing that prevented me from calling The Ninth Gate a full-
blown masterpiece is the ending. If Polanski's intention here was to
leave us with unanswered questions, he succeeded, as his movie just
sorta stops instead of giving us a satisfying and rewarding conclusion.
As spectacular as everything that came before the ending was, such
ambiguity was a letdown.
Still, there is so much good about The Ninth Gate that I recommend it
strongly despite a disappointing ending. There's nothing like a little
devil worship to complete a weekend, don't you think?

Title
Review for Dîner de cons, Le (1998)
Starring Jacques Villeret, Thierry Lhermitte, Brochant Francis Huster,
Daniel Prévost. Rated PG-13.
The Dinner Game, a good-natured, old-fashioned French farce by Francis
Veber (La Cage aux Folles) isn't particularly good, but to the
filmmakers' credit it could not have been much better. It's the kind of
movie in which the plot itself is a restriction, preventing it from
being more than a disappointingly broad, mildly entertaining situation
comedy. One of cinema's biggest problems is movies that fail to realize
the potential of their respective storylines; here's one that milks the
most out of its storyline but still turns out to be merely serviceable.
The cockeyed premise behind this fairly futile attempt is this: a group
of rich, snobby Frenchmen get together every week for a very special
dinner. To this dinner each must bring a very special guest. This guest
must be the biggest, most boring idiot they can find. They make the poor
saps humiliate themselves by simply talking, and whoever brings the
biggest idiot is the winner.
Publisher Pierre Bronchant (Thierry Lhermitte) is lacking an idiot just
a couple of days before the dinner. One of his pals, however, pulls him
out of potential hot water and finds him a dilly of a buffoon: François
Pignon, a lowly accountant who makes miniature models of famous
structures out of matchsticks. Bronchant is sure he has a winner on his
hands so he invites Pignon to his house for a drink and then to his
dinner under the guise that his publisher friends are interested in
doing a book on his models.
Unexpectedly, Bronchant hurts his back and can't go to the dinner. He is
unable to prevent Pignon from coming over to his house anyway. So it is
that Bronchant winds up at his idiot's mercy: nearly immobilized and
with his wife leaving him (oh, I'm sorry, did I forget to mention
that?), he has nothing to do but reluctantly accept Pignon's help. The
results are not pretty.
The Dinner Game plays out with all the wacky spontaneity of a Seinfeld
episode; unfortunately it also has the same sitcom humor and feel. Much
of the film is undeniably funny, but unfortunately Veber has yet to
learn the meaning of the word "subtlety". The movie may be amusing but
it's also fairly dumb and frivolously hollow; the jokes fly at you but
as they register in your head you can think of only the fact that you
could turn on the tv and see undeniably funnier stuff.
The performances are certainly good: veteran actor Jacques Villeret is
delightful as the oddly charming buffoon and Thierry Lhermitte's
Bronchant is duly contemptable. Indeed, the actors often make The Dinner
Game funnier than it perhaps should be; a classic example of performers
not only rising above their material but bringing it up a notch too.
The Dinner Game is a well-intentioned movie, making sure that it gets
across its message: don't judge a book by its cover. Unfortunately by
the end of the movie Veber still hasn't learned the meaning of the word
"subtlety" and the movie's theme winds up being conveyed in an
annoyingly outright manner. Instead of making it a constant
undercurrent, he just comes out and tells us what he wants us to
perceive from his movie.
If nothing else, The Dinner Game is a good try; an engaging and amusing
-- although not intelligent or subtle -- farce that entertains even as
its flaws are clear as day. I can't come right out and recommend this
movie but it isn't a bad way to spend an evening, especially if the
alternative selections don't appeal to you.

Review for Superstar (1999)
"You might not want to say 'Superstar' anymore because some people
might say that you super suck."
Starring Molly Shannon, Will Ferrell, Elaine Hendrix, Mark McKinney.
Rated PG-13.
I love Saturday Night Live. The legendary variety show has slipped a
bit in consistency of late, but it's still the smartest, funniest 90
minutes on tv. The good thing about the show -- and head honcho Lorne
Michaels is still not getting this -- is that the laughs come in four
minute skits. That's right, four minutes. Four, not ninety. When a
concept that can barely fill four minutes with laughs is stretched to
more than twenty times that length, very bad things happen. Those bad
things are called "SNL Movies".
There have, actually, been a couple of successful ones. The Blues
Brothers was a hit, and Wayne's World developed an inordinately large
fan following, though I didn't really like it. But they were followed
by abominations such as Wayne's World 2, It's Pat! (a title eventually
tagged with "but who cares?") and A Night at the Roxbury, proving that
a variety sketch is not the best model for a feature-length movie. And
yet the saga continues with Superstar, which earns points for breaking
the gender barrier but quickly loses them for being, well, not very
funny.
Whether she likes it or not, the film belongs to SNL vet Molly Shannon
who plays Mary Katherine Gallagher, an unpopular schoolgirl with dreams
of big-time stardom and fantasies about the French-kissing the school
hunk (Will Ferrell). Her dream is to become famous so she tries out for
her Catholic School's talent show ("Cheerleaders Fight VD"). Being the
most unpopular girl in school, she is mocked and jeered at every turn,
except, of course, by the school psycho (Harland Williams) who
inevitably turns out to be a sweet and tender "big lug".
There are obstacles everywhere, from Mary's grandmother who wants her
to be a business woman, to the nasty Evian ("Go drink a bottle of
yourself," Mary exclaims), the head cheerleader whose goal in life is
to make Mary miserable. Can she hop over all the hurdles in her path
and become a Superstar? What do you think?
There is something inherently amusing about watching 40-year-olds play
high-schoolers (not to give any bright minds in Hollywood any ideas),
and I liked the fact that they let Shannon, a woman, do all-out Carrey-
style full body humor. In fact, Shannon is a funny and talented
actress, but she is stuck with a script that makes her rerun the same
gags over and over until even she looks like she is about to bail.
Superstar is intermittently amusing, but those moments are few and far
between. It's full of jabs at Catholicism (I'm surprised the ubiquitous
and rather blind to reality Catholic League didn't make this film a
prime target of its protests; at times, it's downright offensive) that
aren't particularly clever, just mean-spirited.
Superstar is redundant, repetitive and not particularly amusing, with
an unacceptably low gag-to-laugh ratio. A gleeful spirit surrounds the
film's star, but she is lost in a meandering plot and an unsatisfying
screenplay. I have a feeling that sooner or later she will get the
project she deserves; for now, she'll have to settle at making us laugh
on tv, forgetting this misguided production as quickly as possible.
Shannon is a veritable superstar already. This was the last thing she
needed.

Title
Review for Besieged (1998)
Starring Thandie Newton, David Thewlis. Rated R.
What we have here is one of that rare breed of movies that can flaunt
both style and substance; visual éclat as well as thoughtful thematic
undertones. Coming to us from the famed Italian director Bernardo
Bertolucci (The Last Emperor, Stealing Beauty), Besieged is an
involving, artful love story and a meditative look at lives lost and
lives gained as one moves to a higher social existence.
The film begins with African folk music, and a young woman named
Shangurai (Thandie Newton) riding her bike along a bumpy road in what
seems to be South Africa. Menacing-looking cars pass her, and before
long she sees her husband, a local schoolteacher, being dragged to jail.
Devastated, Shangurai relocates to Rome (the move happens in a flash: I
missed it), where she becomes a live-in housekeeper for an eccentric
American man named Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis).
Kinsky falls in love with the beautiful Shangurai and passionately asks
for her hand in marriage, saying that he will do anything to make her
love him, to which she responds "Get my husband out of jail!" The
impeccably well-intentioned Kinsky backs off, and unbeknownst to her
starts a campaign to set Shangurai's hubby free. Evidently, she figures
it out and is shocked, because he sells everything, including his
beloved piano to make his love happy.
The significance of Besieged lies in the transition between Shangurai's
two lives. Her first is the one she led in Africa, and the culture and
memories stick with her. She has trouble letting them go; this is
manifested through music and her faith for her lost husband. And yet as
her life in Rome progresses, she is mesmerized by Kinsky and his
existence until finally, in the ending, their heretofore affair erupts
and leaves Shangurai's previous life outside the front door.
This is at the core of Bertolucci's film, which actually consists of
minimal dialogue. What it does have, however, is visuals aplenty; a
cornucopia of gorgeous images and deft camerawork. Bertolucci has a way
of moving the camera at blazing speed yet having the film flow smoothly.
Watch for this during Shangurai and Kinsky's first main conversation:
the lens moves frantically from one face to the other creating a level
of tension while at the same time maintaining the film's consistently
hypnotic mood and pace.
I liked Thandie Newton (Beloved) as Shangurai, with her achingly
expressive eyes and her trembling yet assertive voice. I likewise
enjoyed the underused David Thewlis in the Kinsky role, although neither
performance will earn any formal recognition because of the lack of
dramatic dialogue involved.
Besieged is a solid, unpretentious arthouse dweller (is there such a
thing?) that doesn't aim very high and hits the target. It's a light
endeavor that doesn't stay with you for long (although the ending is
powerful) but it's nevertheless an effective love story all the while
being a thoughtful meditation on the social differences of life in two
separate worlds.

Review for Happy, Texas (1999)
 I can't remember a single memorable quote from this dud. Sorry.
Starring Steve Zahn, Jeremy Northam, William H. Macy, Illeana Douglas,
Ally Walker. Rated PG-13.
Happy, Texas is the worst kind of disappointment, a film that has no
idea what to do with its ingenious comic premise. It takes a good idea
and then does everything wrong. Nothing works. The performances are way
off, the direction misses the point and the laughs are conspicuously
absent. Here is a film with nothing -- nothing -- going for it; how it
became a big hit at the Sundance Film Festival is completely beyond me.
The film actually shares some plot traits with the infinitely better
Three to Tango. Both films are about heterosexual people forced to
pretend they're gay; in this case to escape arrest, in the other to get
a job. Here our protagonists are two escaped convicts; Wayne Wayne
Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn), who is very volatile and slightly slow and
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam), who is the smart one -- and we know he
is smart, you see, because the movie tells us that he was convicted for
credit card fraud. See? Smart guy! In any event, the two manage to
escape when their transport van crashes. They seek refuge in a town
called Happy, Texas where they are mistaken for a gay couple who
organize kiddie beauty pageants.
Being smart, Harry decides to stay there. He appoints Wayne Wayne Wayne
as the pageant master while he himself deals with the more pressing
business such as planning a bank robbery and courting a town gal (Ally
Walker) without revealing his true sexual orientation (gasp! -- he is
straight!). Wayne Wayne Wayne struggles to manage the wee ones while
Harry hangs out with townfolk. Told you he was smart.
What smart Harry didn't count on was Chappy (William H. Macy), the town
sheriff and a closeted homosexual. All of a sudden Chappy decides that
Harry is his kind of guy and wants to go out with him. Not wanting to
compromise their position, Harry goes with him to a gay bar and fakes
a "relationship". Since he doesn't want to "do anything" with the
kindly sheriff, he must convince him that he likes to "move his
relationships along slowly".
This movie is a total mess. The premise is handled incorrectly. The
jokes just sort of sit there; director Mark Illsley never aspires to
take them a step further. Northam's Harry spends most of the running
time essentially denying the premise; he refuses to accept his own idea
of pretending to be gay. Even in his scenes with Chappy, he is oddly
reserved, never bursting into a sort of outrageousness we would expect
from a movie like this. Zahn hams it up like nobody's business to the
point where he is like one of the three stooges. Not funny. In the part
of the would-be pageant coordinator we want someone clever who will
think on his feet and give us something creative rather than some moron
who will do little but make a fool of himself.
The only performer who emerges out of this ordeal with some dignity
left is the great William H. Macy, the one actor here who is successful
in his role. Zahn and Northam simply have the wrong idea; their
performances are inadequate because of the way they choose to play
them. I don't know why someone didn't at least momentarily halt this
production half-way through and insist that it wasn't working. The real
disaster isn't even the film itself but the fact that reportedly
intelligent people let this movie's inadequacies get to the point of no
return.
Happy, Texas could've worked. All it needed was a good think-through.
Performances should have been altered and the script reworked. That's
what the film needed. It didn't get it. This is the result.

Review for Topsy-Turvy (1999)
Starring Jim Broadbent, Allan Corduner, Lesley Manville, Eleanor David,
Ron Cook. Directed by Mike Leigh. Rated R.
I think I missed something here. I have seen cream-of-the-crop critics,
whom I greatly respect, name Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy the absolute best
film of 1999. I'm not trying to sling mud on their decision -- maybe
their choice was a valid one. But I just don't see where they are
coming from. The movie is rock-solid: I enjoyed it tremendously and
thought it was a 3 hours well spent. But best movie of the year?
Goodness, no. But if ever there was a movie that's actually easy to
overpraise, this would have to be it right here.
At first glance, this elaborate costume drama seems like a bizarre
choice for Mike Leigh, acclaimed British director of more human dramas
like Naked and Secrets and Lies but after closer examination you
realize that Topsy-Turvy has quite a bit in common with those films. It
is the story of notorious playwrights Gilbert and Sullivan --
fictionalized, I'm sure -- and their struggles with success, the idea
of being the "kings of Topsy-Turvydom," as well as their personal mini-
rivalries.
Allan Corduner plays composer Sullivan as a pretentious man,
dissatisfied with the pair's 10 hits in a row. He doesn't like the
fluffiness of their work, the relative insignificance of it. He wants
to do something more significant, like a real opera, something to show
for himself. He has kidney problems and goes on a "recovery trip" to
Europe. When he gets back to Britain, he meets again with his artistic
partner Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and, for the first time, refuses to
work with his latest scenario, dismissing it as sheer folly at a time
when he wants to do something that will be remembered.
Gilbert is faced with a dilemma: Sullivan refuses to set his piece and
the theater owner who puts on their plays is pressuring them for
another (they're currently reviving one of their classics). He searches
for inspiration and gets it when his wife takes him to a Japanese
culture festival. He has a good time and when he gets back home, he
realizes that he has his next play at his fingertips: "The Mikado."
Leigh's production is distinguished by obsessively meticulous attention
to detail. He takes the time to actually put on good chunks of Gilbert
& Sullivan's plays and it seems he has spent at least half of Topsy-
Turvy's budget just setting them up. Though I sometimes wonder about
the purpose of having so much play footage, which stretches the movie's
running time to nearly three hours, I have to admit that it does look
good, as well as authentic (Leigh spent a lot of time working in
theater as well as film).
The more interesting of the two playwrights is definitely Gilbert, who
is portrayed as a man afraid of his own success. At one point, he
almost sabotages his own show by cutting out a crucial song. When The
Mikado is first put on, he wanders the street for most of the
performance and when he gets back, the first thing he asks is "How bad
was it?" Sullivan doesn't come off as quite that complicated; he's an
adulterer and an operetta composer with delusions of grandeur. Still,
this is a human story: the characters' inner conflicts (as shown here)
are actually vastly more interesting than the body of their work.
Both Corduner and Broadbent are relative unknowns in Hollywood and
since this is the polar opposite of what we would call a "Star
Vehicle," casting them was probably a good idea. This goes double
considering that they turn out to be top-notch actors as well. Leigh
could not have asked for more from their performances. Broadbent is
especially effective, funny when he needs to be but also human and
affecting.
The movie is chock full of great acting, great sets, great costumes,
great lines and even some (sketchy) character complexity. For that I am
most greatful. But when people say that this is the best movie of the
year, I say there needs to be more. I certainly don't mean to belittle
this effort, though. Indeed, a job well done.

Review for Plunkett & Macleane (1999)
 "The wise man mocks the man, the mocked man mocks the mocker"
Starring Johnny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Liv Tyler, Ken Stott, Alan
Cumming. Rated R.
Plunkett & MaCleane is a period piece mired down by modern MTV
pretentions. I have nothing against the MTV approach to filmmaking --
used properly it can save a movie (see Stigmata) -- but it ruins this
one, making a muddled, incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting
premise. There are certain genres that just don't go together.
The film opens with a sequence that I still don't understand. It
involves some sort of prison outbreak, a robbery, and a gem that keeps
being eaten. In any case, the caper (whatever it may be) brings
together Plunkett and MaCleane (Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller,
respectively), two happy-go-lucky Brits with no way to make a living.
They make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves
until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to America. Their first
heist involves a young debutante named Lady Rebecca (Liv Tyler); a
woman Macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier.
His decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks
the name "Gentleman Highwaymen."
Lady Rebecca also happens to be the niece of the Lord Chief Justice, a
glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career. He
demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately, leaving
the job in the hands of the devious Chance (Ken Stott) who has a few
more things on his mind than catching criminals. Meanwhile, Macleane
falls in love with Rebecca infuriating the businesslike Plunkett, who
doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic
travails.
Director Jake Scott, son of Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner), has his
father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill
in actually moving the camera. Most of the action scenes are filmed in
such a rapid, jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going
on. The camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully
dizzying The Blair Witch Project due to its lack of fluidity. Instead
of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events
Scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits. He barely ever holds a
shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems
more like a couple frames between each cut.
The weird, almost defiant lack of dialogue (there are no -- NO --
conversations lasting over, say, 20 seconds) undermines character
definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than
characters. The love affair between MaCleane and Rebecca is no
different, emotionless and unrealistic. When the script calls for
Macleane to decide between going to America and going to meet his
lover, there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for
him to abandon his goal; he and Rebecca barely even speak to each other
throughout the film.
Plunkett and MaCleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over
substance but since its style, quite frankly, blows, the film has no
hope of succeeding on any level. I wanted to appreciate this movie on
the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but I couldn't -- it was so
kinetic it gave me a headache.

Review for 10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
10 Things I Hate About You (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/10thingsihateaboutyou.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Joseph-Gordon Levitt, Larisa Oleynik. Rated PG-13.
The teen comedy genre has been a wildly successful one these past few years,
as we've seen all kinds of rip-offs, abominations and even a few straining
originals. It's even spawned a few updates of Shakespeare and Dickens, the
weirdest of which was Leonardo DiCaprio's love-it-or-hate-it 1996 radical
version of William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. Yes, we've gotten some
weird, weird films, some hopelessly raunchy, others openly profound. 10
Things I Hate About You is somewhere in between. Very loosely based on (maybe
even just inspired by) William Shakespeare's comedy The Taming of the Shrew,
one thing that 10 Things has going for it is a teriffic ensemble cast of
teens. Larisa Oleynik (of Nickelodeon fame) is Bianca Stratford, a gorgeous
and insanely popular sophomore that has one monkey on her back: her dad will
not let her date... until her sister, Kat Stratford does. The problem is that
Kat is rather anti-social, to put it mildly, and getting her to date is
almost as inconceivable to her as getting her dad to loosen up (fairly
inconceivable, in case you do not get my drift).
That also presents a problem for newcomer Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who
has a major crush on Bianca. Fortunately for him he has a quick-thinking pal
who gets Joey, the school hunk with a crush for Bianca, to pay another guy to
date Kat. The conflict, then is who will get the girl, Joey (the jerk) or
Cameron (the nice guy).
10 Things has little more in common with The Taming of The Shrew than my
mother does with Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but it doesn't really make much
difference. This is one of the more energetic teen films that I've watched
lately; not as hypnotically laid back as Varsity Blues or as uneven as She's
All That. That almost always works to the movie's advantage; because lame
scenes are made nifty by the movie's endless energy. Something like a guy
serenading a girl who is angry at him through the PA system on the soccer
field would be ridiculously schmaltzy in any other movie, but when said guy
starts running around spanking policemen who are trying to apprehend him the
whole scene takes on an appealing quality.
The performances in 10 Things are likewise stellar. Although Gordon-Levitt is
moderately annoying in a role it's difficult not to be annoying in, other
young actors and actresses triumph. Julia Stiles is achingly sincere as Kat
Stratford, with a kind of unapproachable vulnerability about her. Andrew
Keagan is effectively repulsive as the conceited school hunk used as a pawn
by Cameron and his friends. But the highlight of the bunch is the beautiful,
funny, charming Larisa Oleynik. Previously seen on the Nickelodeon tv show
The Secret World of Alex Mack, this actress is clearly likeable enough to
have a great future in Hollywood.
10 Things I Hate About You is certainly not without its flaws. We have the
usual "I was a bet?/You were payed to like me?" speech which is like a rubber
stamp in these teen movies. Another rubber stamp is the fact that the film
ends with a prom. The prom is a perfect symbol of teenage angst when utilized
correctly (remember Carrie?) but nowadays we see proms that end with disaster
so often (even in the recent Never Been Kissed which I happened to like) that
it is no longer effective at projecting teenage anger at the world.
Still, those relatively minor complaints are not nearly enough to discredit
this teriffic little movie, which is entertaining despite all of its flaws.
It is nothing unique to be sure, but it is a nice diversion if one has a
rainy evening with nothing to do on one's hands.

Review for Third World Cop (1999)
Starring Paul Campbell, Mark Danvers, Carl Bradshaw, Audrey Reid.
Directed by Chris Browne Not Rated (R-equivalent for sex, drug use and
gun violence).
The island of Jamaica hasn't exactly embraced the film industry. The
Internet Movie Database lists only ten films that have come from
Jamaica; just 3 in the past ten years. The latest is called Third World
Cop, a drama with a simple, appealing story but dreadful execution. The
film's defenders may chalk it up to the film's low budget but far
better movies have been made for much less money. In an age where you
can make an acclaimed movie for less than the price of a Ford Taurus,
filmmakers need a better excuse.
"Capone," a renegade cop whose gun "doesn't respect anyone" is
transferred to the violent city of Kingston, Jamaica (but not before
his supervisor gets to tell him "Your methods may be effective, but
they're not always right!") There, he reunites with his childhood
buddy "Ratty" (Mark Danvers) and makes himself useful by fighting a
local gun-smuggling operation led by thug Wonie (Carl Bradshaw). He
does this by shooting pretty much everyone he catches.
He soon discovers that his friend Ratty is Wonie's right-hand man. He
must now decide whether to stand by his convictions and bust his friend
or to turn the other cheek and preserve a lifelong friendship. There's
also Capone's childhood sweetheart who is friends with both men. She
can do nothing but stand by and watch her friends destroy each other.
The plot is simple, fast and to the point. There's little filler, few
significant supporting characters and minimal exposition. But despite
the alluring straightforwardness of the story, virtually all other
aspects of Third World Cop leave a lot to be desired. The script is
almost unbearable, piling cliché on top of cliché until we're left with
dialogue straight out of "The Screenwriter's Guide to Cop Dramas." My
personal favorite: after getting into about 15 shootouts, Capone comes
up to his friend and says "Guns only lead to self-destruction."
Paul Campbell, apparently a huge star in Jamaica, is passable as the
title character, even though the same "menacing" expression never
leaves his face. He's flawlessly suited to the role, which requires him
to talk minimally but be able to wield two firearms at a time. I also
liked Mark Danvers, who evokes sympathy despite dialogue that made me
want to slap him. As for Carl Bradshaw, the film's most seasoned actor,
well, he's just irritating as the villain, comical rather than
dangerous.
The movie was directed by Chris Browne and shot on video rather than
film. Browne has worked as camera assistant on many high-profile
American films, though this is his first venture to the director's
chair. He did not write the movie, so the blame does not lie with him;
as a matter of fact he did a relatively excellent job considering that
he didn't use film. The camerawork is unaffected by the medium.
Third World Cop's press kit proclaims the movie to be "Jamaica's
biggest blockbuster," saying that "more than 10% of the adult
population in Jamaica saw the film." This is probably good -- I welcome
anything that encourages a country to make itself a presence in the
film industry. I wish Jamaica could have chosen a better movie to be
their breakthrough but, as Third World Cop's characters say, "Respect."
For people who have not seen a lot of movies and are unfamiliar with
their conventions, it might even prove to be a serviceable experience.
For American audiences, however, there are better alternatives.

Title
Review for Home Page (1999)
Featuring Justin Hall, Harold Rheingold, Jaime Levy, Julie Petersen,
Carl Steadman, Marjorie Silver, Denise Tenorio, Doug Block. Not Rated
(the equivalent of a mild R for profanity, brief nudity and general
weirdness).
Trying to decipher the true nature and purpose of the internet is akin
to trying to figure out the meaning of life, in that it is an
impossible endeavor. Even in 1996, when this movie was shot, the world
wide web was so many different things to so many different people; now,
it has become an institution comparable to television. Everyone's got
it, some can't live without it. While it may be exceedingly difficult
to "figure out" the net, it would be nice if we could make some sense
out of it and that is exactly what the new documentary Home Page, in
its mature, thoughtful manner, tries to do.
Filmmaker Doug Block started out with the honorable intention of making
a film diary of his adorable little toddler daughter. That was until he
met Justin Hall. A college student at the time, Hall is what we
commonly call a "nerd." He dresses bizarrely, spends an exorbitant
amount of time staring at the computer screen and, most interestingly,
posts every detail of his life on his webpage (http://www.links.net).
Block follows Justin through the next few years of his eccentric
existance and is inspired to make his own webpage, a journal of his
documentary travails (The D-Word). Justin, meanwhile, goes on a country-
spanning trip promoting the internet. His Odyssey finally lands him in
San Francisco, where he moves in with famed internet author and guru
Howard Rheingold, whom he greatly admires. They work on the development
of "Electric Minds," an ambitious web magazine that went "out of
business" some seven months after its launch.
The film's focus isn't just on Justin; indeed, we become intimately
familiar with some other interesting people such as Rheingold himself,
Julie (http://www.awaken.org), Justin's former honcho at HotWired (a
web magazine where he was an intern), as well as the people behind
Suck, a popular, satirical internet publication. These folks all offer
their theories on the web; some are funny, some are weird, all are
interesting.
Home Page begins by abandoning all skepticism. Block acknowledges the
fact that the internet is indeed the future and goes from there. His
subjects' musing comes off as intelligent speculation from people who
know what they are talking about, rather than disjointed ramblings of
web weirdoes, which he easily could have given us. The film works
because it isn't gimmicky or pretentious, rather, it's sincere. Here is
a film with an affection for its subject.
Block finally comes up with the obvious: the internet is a place where
a person of any race, religious affiliation, personality and generation
can communicate and find people with similar interests. For some it is
a way of life, for others it's but a mild diversion, but it has
something for everyone. Granted, this is fairly simple stuff but Block
finds creative, personal ways of presenting it, until we begin to get a
more thorough understanding of the web's significance and its meaning
in all of our lives. Home Page doesn't serve as an instigator of new
and radical ideas, rather, it pushes an already realized and still
valid thought up a notch.
The movie ends with a shot that is at once chilling and promising: a
girl stares, transfixed, at a computer monitor while the notorious
internet logon phone sound plays in the background. There is a child
with an advantage, gazing at the future with those wide, endlessly
curious eyes.

Review for Ghosts of Mars (2001)
Starring Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Pam Grier, Clea
DuVall, Jason Statham, Liam Waite, Joanna Cassidy,
Wanda DeJesus, and Richard Cetrone as "Big Daddy
Mars." Directed by John Carpenter. Rated R.
I haven't kept up with John Carpenter over the years.
Previous to this, my experience with the notorious
horror director has been limited to Halloween and the
much-maligned (but not by me) 1995 remake of Village
of the Damned. Now, after seeing John Carpenter's
Ghosts of Mars, I think I'll rent Starman this
weekend. His latest is exactly what I've been missing:
mindless, schlocky, well-made science fiction that
entertains without condescending. Modern sci-fi tends
to come in two varieties: thoughtful and lofty, or
downright bad. Though I always welcome the former,
it's good to see someone subvert the trend of the
latter.
There's a difference between a simple plot and a
stupid one. Carpenter's is a no-brainer, but it's
executed with flair, talent, and few lapses in logic.
It deals with a team of policemen in a distant-future
Mars, who are sent by train to a secluded penitentiary
to transport a prisoner - "Desolation Williams (Ice
Cube) - back to civilization for trial. The film is
framed so that we learn of the mission's only
survivor: Melanie Bradford (Natasha Henstridge). What
follows is a story told by Bradford to a group of
justices trying her for narcotics use.
Her team finds the prison all but abandoned; those who
are left have, for the most part, been overrun by
ghosts who possess their victims and control them,
making them mutilate their bodies and stick weird
things in their faces. Soon enough Melanie, her crew,
and the few remaining prisoners (including Williams),
barricade themselves in one of the prison buildings,
to defend against the planet's former inhabitants who
have no plans to let humanity take over.
After the super-accelerated set-up, Carpenter goes
into overdrive with pretty much one action sequence
after another. These are almost indescribably chaotic,
but so masterfully filmed that there is never question
about what's going on. There are scenes where just
about every character is fighting in the same frame
and everything remains clear and lucid. There's a
temptation to bash these kinds of movies; it's hokum,
yes, but what hokum.
I've liked Ice Cube since I saw him in Three Kings> --
where he was the most likeable character - and he
comes through as an action hero in Ghosts of Mars. He
and Henstridge have an undeniable chemistry, and even
though their
enemies-who-must-depend-on-one-another-to-survive
relationship is clichéd, I believed it. Henstridge
herself had all but disappeared after her supposedly
star-making turn in Species, and she returns to
stardom in a role that I liked, even if it's unlikely
to earn her the right to ask for a $20 million
paycheck.
I sat back, relaxed, and watched with an ever-present
smile on my face. I had a good time. A.I. this isn't,
but it's good, solid science fiction in the vein of
the Alien series. But whatever its shortcomings, I
refuse to give a grade lower than a B- to any movie
that ends with the exchange: "Let's go kick some
ass."/"That's what we do best." 

Title
Review for Thirteenth Floor, The (1999)
Starring Craig Bierko, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Gretchen Mol. Rated R.
Can there possibly be anything new to say about the concept of virtual
reality impersonating reality? In the past two years, Hollywood has
pummeled us drilled with the idea that the world as we know it may not
be what we think it to be -- films such as Dark City, The Matrix,
eXistenZ and now The Thirteenth Floor have all been brooding over the
thought. Notice that I have recommended all of the above, the reason
being that I love these kinds of movies; they have the potential to
excite my imagination and get my adrenaline flowing, if done well. Oddly
enough, these four movies have all been done well.
The Thirteenth Floor is an ambitious little movie that dares to open
with Descartes' famous quote "I think therefore I am." At first glance
it will seem ill-advised and pretentious, especially if you've seen any
promo material for the movie. But stick with it, and you'll find that
the presence of that quote in the very beginning provides the movie with
the power to stick with you for some time after it is over.
It opens with what seems like the early 19th century. We see an elderly
man (Armin Mueller-Stahl) leave a hotel (where a beautiful young girl is
peacefully sleeping on a bed), leave a note for the bartender to give to
someone else and head home. He comes home to his wife, gets into bed and
we find out that the guy is playing an elaborate computer game; indeed
he wakes up in a computer lab. Sooner than later, he is stabbed to
death. All evidence points to a young executive of the company, Douglas
Hall (Craig Bierko) to have killed him. Doug's only hope, it seems, is
to find a message that his now-deceased boss allegedly left inside the
simulation. What he finds changes his perception of reality, himself and
the people around him.
What's terrific about the first two thirds of The Thirteenth Floor is
how the movie plays out as a mystery; revealing its secret by slowly
peeling away its layers. It succeeds in keeping the deductive viewers a
half step ahead of the characters (mainly because for a corporate
executive, Douglas isn't terribly bright), but not so far that we become
bored.
Unfortunately for those that have just begun to get wrapped up in the
proceedings, the film falls apart completely towards the end. The
script, never particularly outstanding to begin with, starts to move
with undesirably rapid speed towards inanity, and the romance that
develops betweed Douglas and a beautiful woman with a dark secret
(Gretchen Mol) is not only horridly written but it is also
dissappointing as a payoff (this is what we get?!?). The ending leaves
too many loose-ends untied to be particularly satisfying, and it is also
telegraphed about 30 minutes before it actually happens so that one
pretty much knows for sure what is going to happen.
Mueller-Stahl is engaging in a role that never quite dies. Bierko is
just okay as the protagonist, although unfortunately he doesn't project
his shock at his discovery convincingly. Gretchen Mol is absolutely
dreadful in an essential role, but going into the explicit details of
her performance or her character will ruin a few surprises, so I'm not
going to go into detail here.
I never like seeing a movie that shows such promise nearly destroy
itself by such an uninspired resolution. The Thirteeth Floor is
regardless a respectable movie (although, for the record, I was
originally going to go with a much less enthusiastic **1/2, until I
found myself thinking about the movie more during that same night) but
it could easily been truly excellent -- it could have been the best
movie of the year. But it's not, and The Matrix holds on to that dubious
distinction.

Review for Lake Placid (1999)
"I didn't know crocodiles could swim across oceans!"
"Of course not! That information is concealed in books!"
Starring Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson,
Betty White. Rated R.
I believe it was Wes Craven who first had the brilliant idea to combine
horror and comedy with A Nightmare on Elm Street back in 1984. The
obligatory gruesome killer no longer had to glumly and wordlessly chase
his victims. Craven's butt-ugly and imposingly menacing Freddy Krueger
didn't just turn unlucky teenagers into a bloody pulp, the bastard
spewed wisecracks as well.
Since then, the horror-comedy genre has become quite popular, with its
most notable success being the glorious Scream series: two (so far)
witty, scary and nearly parodic slasher films that have built a
remarkable fan base. So it's only fitting and, quite frankly,
inevitable, that Hollywood's best and brightest wind up experimenting
with this lucrative hybrid. David E. Kelley, the writer and creator of
such tv smash hits as Ally McBeal and The Practice takes a stab at it as
the screenwriter of Lake Placid, a snappy (no pun intended) and witty
but not scary variation on Jaws.
Delivering one-liners is an artform and few do it with more panache then
Oliver Platt, one of the stars in this flamboyant creature-feature about
a gigantic crocodile that preys on those unfortunate enough to boat or
dive in Lake Placid, Maine. Investigating the vicious reptile are a slow
but lovable small-town sheriff (Brendan Gleeson), a cocky official from
Fish and Game (Bill Pullman), a pretty lady from the New York Museum of
Natural History (Bridget Fonda) and a filthy rich eccentric who worships
crocodiles (Platt). The four of them seem to bite off more than they can
chew when they get up close and personal with the crocodile in order to
learn more about how it got all the way to Maine.
When it is clear that they are dealing with a very dangerous and an even
more aggressive animal, the characters wage a cinematically familiar
battle: do they kill the thing or do they try to trap it? The latter
choice is clearly more humane and is preferred by the museum gal and the
croc-worshipper while the other two characters would rather take the
more sure-fire approach. It's a shame that instead of making a choice
writer Kelley and director Steve Miner manage to have their cake and eat
it too with a throwaway, ludicrous plot twist.
At its best, Lake Placid is enjoyable nonsense. It has some wonderful
lines ("Had any bear attacks recently?" "Bears don't attack people
underwater." "Probably a beaver then.") and has some fun with its
crocodile premise, but it's inconceivable to brand the movie as "good".
The main problem, as I see it, is that while the wisecracks that the
characters lambast each other with are admittedly funny, the plot itself
takes a back seat to them. The film moves from one sarcastic one-liner
to the next with no consideration for its pacing or its storyline.
To the film's credit, the crocodiles look good (although I wish we'd
seen some beavers) and we do see some nifty shots of heads being bitten
off and severed toes lying on the ground. Then again with state of the
art technology at every clown's fingertips seamless special effects tend
to no longer come as a surprise (although I must admit I was taken aback
by the caliber of what I saw in What Dreams May Come). That's very
unfortunate because for the avid moviegoer, films that inspire a genuine
feeling of awe and amazement like Jurassic Park did when it was first
released are becoming increasingly difficult to come by.
I really liked Brendan Gleeson as the sheriff: he is funny, refreshingly
self-deprecating and a hell of a lot of fun to watch. I similarly
enjoyed Oliver Platt who took a break from being exclusively a character
actor (and he's a terrific character actor too) to star in a movie
that's trashy fun and give a performance that fits the same description.
On the other hand Bridget Fonda and Bill Pullman constantly come off as
either annoying or flat and I was surprised to see such inept
performances from such accomplished thespians.
There's nothing wrong with enjoying a movie like this as long as you
don't heap any undue praise onto it. It's not a cinematic
accomplishment. It's not a great film or even a good one. It can,
however, be fun: if one is in the mood for a campy monster movie rather
than, say, a moving character study.

Title
Review for 28 Days (2000)
Starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen, Dominic West, Elizabeth
Perkins, Steve Buscemi, Alan Tyduk. Directed by Betty Thomas. Rated PG-
13.
I often wonder why so many writers choose a mental institution of some
sort as the setting for their movie. The most plausible explanation is
the potential for quirky supporting characters -- you need look no
further for colorful personalities than a group of basketcases and
preferably drug addicted ones. It also gives a screenwriter a picture-
perfect set-up for an ordinary-person-placed-in-group-of-eccentric-
misfits plot, a favorite in Hollywood for years. The quitessential
mental hospital movie is, of course, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest;
there have since been many imitators. The latest entry into the genre
is the Sandra Bullock vehicle 28 Days, a superficially entertaining
drama that doesn't bother to expand on its concept much beyond a
skeleton. The characters are enjoyable; the plot is wafer-thin.
In this version, Bullock plays Gwen Cummings, a happy-go-lucky
alcoholic who doesn't realize that she has a problem until she falls on
her sister's wedding cake and, in an effort to find a replacement,
crashes the "just married" limousine into a house. In her trial, which
the film (for better or worse) skips over, she is sentenced to either
28 days of drug rehab or the equivalent time in jail. Not wishing to
spend time in the slammer, Gwen understandably chooses the former. She
arrives at the Serenity Glen Rehabilitation Center where people
basically chant 24/7 (as a substitute for prayer, she is told). Of
course, she's high above all of these freaks, utterly convinced that
she can stop using any time she wants to.
The only person who liked Gwen the way she was before rehab was her
boyfriend Jasper (Dominic West). He comes to visit Gwen at Serenity
Glen, taking her out on boatrides and the like, never forgetting to
bring along a bottle of champagne. This is about the time when Gwen
starts getting serious about kicking the habit. She resents her
boyfriend's attempts to turn her back into the mess of a person she was
before and gets involved with a baseball pitcher (Viggo Mortensen) who
is also in rehab.
28 Days is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: a melodramatic tale
of a woman discovering her worth as a person and that life can be good
without booze. It's nothing groundbreaking, certainly, and director
Betty Thomas (Private Parts) doesn't even suggest that there might be
something here that is beyond the self-evident. Still, there is
something to be said for a film that remains so watchable even when
it's so obviously taking all the easy ways out. This is hardly The Road
Less Traveled, but this highway is so smooth that it's a comfortable
ride.
The film owes its success, in large part, to the typically likable lead
performance by Sandra Bullock. We root for Gwen because Bullock makes
it so apparent that she doesn't know any better; that the only path
through life that anyone has ever shown her has been this destructive
one. As she finally begins to wise up around the middle of the movie,
we can't help but cheer her on. By the same token, Dominic West makes
Jasper an effective bastard without foaming from the mouth; we despise
him, but can imagine why Gwen was attracted to him in the first place.
The characterization is simple, but it works.
Probably the only undisputed triumph here is the ending, which is sweet
without being saccharine and nicely underscores the idea of positive
human interaction instead of mind-altering substances. Despite
everything, I became attached to Gwen Cummings during the course of the
movie and its conclusion made me walk out with a smile.
The most remarkable thing about 28 Days is that it is being marketed as
a comedy. I guess the marketers thought that no one in their right mind
would attend a drug rehab movie that's not magically hilarious so they
spliced together random clips from the film and made it seem like a
laughfest. The film is not downbeat and it isn't depressing, but it
certainly is not a comedy. As a drama, it's nothing special, but I must
admit I enjoyed it and, at times, was even touched. Maybe next time
someone will actually take some chances with the genre.

Review for For Love of the Game (1999)
"Haven't you ever loved anything that much?"
Starring Kevin Costner, Kelly Preston, John C. Reilly. Rated PG-13.
As Waterworld and The Postman prove, Kevin Costner fares better, both
cinematically and financially, when he surrenders the director's chair
to one of his betters and constrains himself to merely being the star.
In For Love of the Game, Costner's triumphant return to baseball (see
Field of Dreams and Bill Durham), the man behind the camera is Sam Raimi
(The Evil Dead, A Simple Plan), an unpretentious yet sublimely confident
auteur with an amazing range (he went from cheesy horror to crime drama
to baseball romance). Raimi's latest is also the best we've seen from
Costner since Tin Cup; an engaging, interestingly structured drama
nearly botched by its denoument. Those who seek to have an unabashedly
positive memory of the film would do well to leave right after its
baseball game centerpiece, the place where it should have been cut off.
For Love of the Game has a baseball backdrop but it is not a "baseball
movie". It's about Billy Chapel (Costner), a great pitcher in the
twilight of his career, who has just been told that he is being traded
from the Detroit Tigers; the team he has played with for some 19 years.
At the same time, he finds out that Jane (Kelly Preston), his long-time
girlfriend decided to leave him. As he goes into his last game of the
season, his last game with the Tigers and possibly his last game, he
remembers and examines important moments in his roller coaster
relationship, discovering more about it than he did during its course.
They met when he saw Jane's car stalled on the side of a highway, with
Jane kicking the living headlights out of the poor vehicle. Being a nice
guy, Billy stops to help, and this being Hollywood, he invites her to go
to a baseball game with him. One thing leads to another and they wind up
together in Billy's hotel room. Now that they've slept together, he
thinks, they're in a relationship, but not so fast: Jane shuns the idea,
wanting to make sure she does not become a "groupie".
After being chased enough times by Billy, she gives it up and the three
(Jane has a daughter) move in together. They are doing wonderfully until
he badly hurts his arm in a woodshop accident. He is determined to make
a comeback and return to the mound; his trainer and his girlfriend are
doubtful and less than supportive. Without thinking the matter through,
Billy explodes and makes Jane leave; an action he comes to regret and
attempts to reconcile.
The love story is told almost exclusively through flashback, the film
cutting back and forth between it and the all-important baseball game
(in which, by the way, Chapel tries for a perfect game). It's not the
most original style of storytelling, but it works because Raimi
effectively and subtly injects the flashbacks with a common theme.
Indeed, up to the last ten minutes, I had a sneaking suspicion that this
might be that rare Hollywood love story that's actually about something.
It built up enough momentum that I was ready for a conclusion to drive
its point home. Instead, what has been a compelling tale of a man
learning to depend on himself turns into a banal, typical, hollow
romance.
This cruel bait-and-switch can only detract from the film to a certain
point. Despite its eventual thematic inadequacies it remains a perfectly
entertaining Tinseltown production. Under the sure direction of Sam
Raimi, it's a lot of fun to watch, even if it's not much else. The
suspense of the baseball game is genuine (though the trailers
thoughtlessly gave away the result) and the romance feels real (most of
the time). There is a fight scene (relationship quarrel, not martial
arts) that is so well-written it's devastating.
Kevin Costner does his job in a relatively straightforward role; though
he has his moments and though I can't point out anything specifically
wrong with what he does, he still tends to fall short of outstanding.
His character is engaging but not really because of Costner's
performance. Kelly Preston, on the other hand, is wonderful. We can
understand why a man would be so interested in her, because we are
equally enchanted. Jane's daughter, played well by Oscar winner Anna
Paquin, is an unusual character because she is not strapped with the
cliche of hating her mom's new boyfriend; a refreshing occurence as
almost all movie kids in a single-parent home are required to despise
their parent's new love interest.
I enjoyed this movie so much that I watched with my hands on my head in
desperation as it grossly undermined itself in the last act. It kept
itself from being anything beyond a solid and entertaining but typically
empty mainstream drama. It's a fun movie -- I recommend it for that --
but little more.

Title
Review for Green Mile, The (1999)
 Starring Tom Hanks, David Morse, Harry Dean Stanton, James Cromwell,
Doug Hutchinson, Sam Rockwell. Directed by Frank Darabont. Rated R.
The infamous Last Mile is chockful of the supernatural and metaphysical
in The Green Mile, a gem from Stephen King and The Shawshank Redemption
director Frank Darabont. At three hours and eight minutes, your bladder
may punish you, but this is one lumberer worth enduring. Hell, it's a
pleasure through and through and one of the year's most powerful films.
Despite its imperfections, I will not forget The Green Mile for a long
time.
The story is told in flashback by an elderly Paul Edgecomb in a nursing
home. He tells his wife about the summer of 1935 when he (played by Tom
Hanks then) was a prison guard in charge of death row inmates.
Edgecomb's domain was called "The Green Mile" -- like the
traditional "Last Mile" except that the floor was the color of faded
limes. The hands-down star of the cellblock was "Ol' Sparky," the
electric chair, sitting peacefully, waiting for its next victim.
One day, a new inmate arrives. This is seven-foot-tall John Coffey
(Michael Clarke Duncan), a towering black man convicted of raping and
killing two young white girls. Coffey immediately shows himself to be
a "gentle giant," of sorts, keeping to himself and crying on occasion.
Soon enough, though, Coffey reveals his extraordinary healing powers by
healing Paul's bladder infection and bringing a mouse back from the
dead.
Doug Hutchinson, having oodles of fun, plays Percy, a vicious, sadistic
guard who takes pleasure in injuring inmates, causes everyone else in
the cellblock trouble and "knows people," preventing Paul or anybody
else to do anything significant about his deviant behavior. What Percy
wants is to be put "up front" for an execution; then, he promises, he
will transfer himself to another government job and Paul will never
hear from him again.
This doesn't sound like much of a plot and that's because it's not a
plot: it's a situation. That's what makes The Green Mile sorta unique:
it doesn't take us through a linear storyline; rather, it sets up a
situation and observes as the characters move through it. And these are
remarkable characters, some of the richest of the year. Hanks's Paul
Edgecomb is fascinating and three-dimensional, a man with an
understated, deeply personal crisis. Percy isn't much in terms of
depth, but he's very fun to watch and even more fun to hate. The most
engaging character in the film is Michael Clarke Duncan's John Coffey.
Duncan deserves an Oscar nomination (though he in all likelyhood won't
get it) for his performance which is genuinely touching and often
devastating.
For over three hours I didn't dare take my eyes off the screen. There's
no denying that The Green Mile is slow and yet it's surprisingly
involving. Moments where essentially nothing is going on manage to be
riveting; the more emotional scenes have unparalelled impact. Making a
movie this long, this passive and this unrelentingly interesting is no
small feat. It's a feat deserving of little gold men.
If there is one flaw here, and a reason I can't give the movie a
flat "A", it's King's/Darabont's insistence on ramming hokey Christ
imagery down our throat. The Christ metaphor is such a staple
in "thoughtful" filmmaking that it seems hackneyed when employed. The
Green Mile's otherwise extraordinarily powerful ending is hampered by
it because we are forced to make an outside connection, an act that
takes us partially out of the otherwordly experience this film provides.
Despite abominations by high-brow literary types, Stephen King is a
very insightful author with a remarkable window into human nature. He
makes keen observations, allowing his readers to tap into the human
part of his stories, no matter how far-fetched they got in their horror
aspects. This gets translated on celluloid when the films are done
right. This one is more than right.

Title
Review for Sexy Beast (2000)
Starring Ray Winstone, Ben Kingsley, Ian McShane,
Amanda Redman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer. Rated R.
Sexy Beast isn't nearly as interesting as it thinks it
is. It's fueled by lead performances that are far more
electrifying than the characters they embody. As heist
flicks go, this one is stunningly boring, as a
gangster film it's nonsensical and as a character
study it's far too shallow to be taken seriously. But
it is blessed with Ray Winstone and Ben Kingsley, and
they just about redeem Jonathan Glazer's debut effort.
This is the kind of "quirky" British movie that gets
high marks with critics because it opens with a scene
of portly Gal (Ray Winstone), mumbling words like
"burning" and "scorching" while sunbathing in a
Speedo. He's a retired criminal who dreads the arrival
of Don Logan, an über-gangster who will try to reel
him in for One Last Heist. His family, none of them
strangers to the criminal underworld, worry that Gal
will be convinced and leave his tranquil life in a
Spanish villa to risk going to jail.
Don Logan arrives in the form of the terrifying Ben
Kingsley. Yes, the Ben Kingsley who embodied Ghandi
and the mild-mannered Jewish accountant in Schindler's
List. He doesn't take "no" for an answer. Actually, he
doesn't take "no" for anything and completely ignores
Gal's repeated, if rather timid, denials, which
invariably begin with "I'm flattered that you'd think
of me, but..."
The interplay between Kingsley and Winstone is easily
the best thing about this hit-and-miss affair. Their
rapid-fire dialogue can be difficult to understand,
since the British dialect they speak comes from a part
of London that tourists never go, but I had no trouble
keeping up with the general gist of their
conversations, which are often wickedly funny. Still,
there is no insight contained in the back-and-forth;
no Tarantino-like layering and depth. It's
entertaining to watch, yes, but nothing more.
This would be okay, but the movie takes a wrong turn
after act two, which ends with the dismissal of one of
the main characters and proceeds to stage what may be
the least interesting movie heist in history. There's
a fundamental error in logic here; since everything
that preceded it focuses on whether or not the heist
would take place, there is absolutely no reason for us
to care about its outcome. It takes place. Great. It's
not the appropriate payoff for Glazer's markedly
different set-up.
Ben Kingsley is awesome, yes, and it's almost a
certainty that he will get an Oscar nod come February.
Winstone also does a great job with his underwritten
role. But we have no emotional investment in their
characters or the plot, and it doesn't feel like
Glazer does either. This isn't a mindless Hollywood
cash cow, but there is no impression that it's a labor
of love. Of course, the worst movies can sometimes
have truly dedicated filmmakers behind them
(Battlefield Earth is already a cliche of an example).
I don't know what the big deal is about this. The
general sentiment towards Sexy Beast seems to be a
close equivalent of "where have you been all my life?"
but I don't think it's remotely a great movie. I
wasn't bored, but I didn't care. 
"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion but not his own facts."

Title
Review for Pushing Tin (1999)
Starring John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Cate Blanchett, Angelina Jolie.
Rated R.
A filmmaker that wants to make an observation of the American workplace can
go many directions. He or she can do it the satirical, brutally funny way,
like Scott Adams likes to do in his Dilbert comics and tv show or like Mike
Judge tried to do with the recent Office Space. One could go with subtle
irony such as Harold Ramis did in Groundhog Day. Or you could go the way of
the new dramedy Pushing Tin. Director Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco, Four
Weddings and a Funeral) essentially pulls a bait-and-switch; he pretends to
focus on the characters and engages us in their stories, but when the movie
is over you realize that what you have just seen is subtle, somewhat
effective social commentary on the unfairness of one fundamental fact: some
people's jobs are just more important than others.
If you've ever wondered, or even been a little frightened of who it is that
patrols the sky making sure that those big things called planes don't crash
into each other while flying 600 miles per hour at 20,000 feet in the air,
this movie may make you a little wary of flying. From the very beginning it
plunges us into the world of the engimatic people that are air-traffic
controllers. Newell introduces us to hot-shot Nick Falzone (John Cusack), a
cocky but gentle, average guy with an average wife. His job, however, is
nothing but average: on his shoulders, every minute of every hour, lie
thousands of lives. One slip and you lose a planeload of people. Fortunately,
Nick hasn't slipped: yet. But then a new guy is hired, Russell (Billy Bob
Thornton, and from the moment the two see each other, they hate each other.
Or so it seems.
What is most interesting about Pushing Tin is the way it handles the men's
intense rivalry. I liked how Newell never let it boil down to something very
simple, like he easily could have. As a matter of fact, the fun part of this
movie is figuring out just what drives these two men. Let me warn you: the
reason is not simple and it never becomes glaringly obvious, although it isn't
particularly hard to see after all is said and done.
Pushing Tin tends to be darkly funny, but if I was asked to classify the
movie I would likely say drama. It is even a real drama, up until about
two-thirds of the way through, when it completely falls apart. For reasons
that never become clear, Pushing Tin falls into the deadly grips of
conventionality just as it was starting to become interesting. It all begins
with a bomb threat -- now you know that a sudden bomb threat in a movie like
this can only ruin it. That holds true, because after that scene everything
goes wrong in this movie. There is a ridiculous and utterly pointless
sequence closer to the end, which I won't go into, but which involves two
people standing under a Boeing 747 as it takes off. It's your average
pseudo-inspirational crap.
Fortunately, the performances from the leads in Pushing Tin are solid
straight across. John Cusack is charismatic in a charismatic role, and Cate
Blanchett finally has a delightfully ordinary role to play, and after seeing
her in Elizabeth it's fun to watch her play an ordinary person. Billy Bob
Thornton is extraordinary once again, more mysterious than anything else in a
role that lets him (for once) underplay his character.
The first half of Pushing Tin works like a gem, the second half flops. I
didn't know whether to laugh, cry or go stand under a Boeing 747.

Review for Keeping the Faith (2000)
Starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller, Jenna Elfman. Directed by Edward
Norton. Rated PG-13.
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Keeping the Faith has
one of the best romantic comedy premises in recent years. The idea is
just brimming with potential and at the hands of two great actors there
shouldn't have been any problems following through on it.
Unfortunately, just when the movie needs insight and originality, the
script eagerly turns to sentimental conventions that have long worn out
their welcome in movies past. This is a movie with a fantastic set-up
but absolutely no payoff.
Edward Norton directs himself and Ben Stiller as two best friends whose
lives have led them in the same direction but on different paths. Brian
Finn (Norton) and Jacob Schram (Stiller) have known each other since
grade school. Now, in their late 20's, they're still pals except that
Jacob has become a Rabbi and Brian a Catholic priest. They've spent the
last few years trying to bring their religions back into pop culture.
Since leather jackets didn't work, they're now trying to form a karaoke
club.
Their lives are routine until Brian receives word that Anna Riley, a
girl they adored as children, is coming back to New York to visit them.
They go to the airport to greet her, complete with a sign that
proclaims "Anna Banana" to bring back a childhood joke. The reunion is
jubilant, as the three have no problem getting back to the kind of
banter that permeated their relationship when they were kids.
But things don't remain that simple for long. Brian, bound by his vow
of chastity and having been bothered little by temptation so far,
begins to fantasize about Anna and struggle with his religion.
Meanwhile, Anna and Jacob begin a more intimate relationship, but
although Jacob is not sworn to celibacy, his parents, his congregation
and his community all expect him to marry a nice Jewish girl and a
relationship with Anna is unlikely to get him the promotion to Head
Rabbi he so desperately wants.
There's some good stuff here. Stiller and Norton are both wonderful
actors with the ability to breathe life into the most mundane dialogue.
Jenna Elfman, too, is a great comic talent -- heretofore woefully
underused (and no, EdTV doesn't count) and now surprisingly promising.
The script, by first-timer Stuart Blumberg, has intermittent laughs and
a few slight insights into interfaith relationships. But thanks to (in
all probability) some clueless studio execs, all of that adds up to
exactly zilch.
The ending is a gigantic cop-out. What began as a seriously funny
comedy about the intermingling of love and faith ends as stupidly sappy
chunk of drivel, reverting back to that old Hollywood mentality that if
the protagonists of a love story start getting really lucky, things all
of a sudden start going their way, all the characters turn out to have
good intentions and at the end everything is just perfect that the
audience will walk out grinning stupidly. That's only sometimes true.
You have to have the right set-up, establish the right mood for that
kind of ending. If it's out of the blue, you get something like Keeping
the Faith -- a movie so careful not to offend that it quickly polishes
any provocativeness off with an unnatural happy ending.
At a running time of well over two hours, there's plenty of time for
everything and Keeping the Faith tries mightily to please everyone. But
it failed to satisfy me. I'm not sure who is at fault, but the movie
wimps out.

Title
Review for Toy Story 2 (1999)
Featuring the voice talents of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack,
Kelsey Grammer, Wayne Knight. Rated G.
Toy Story 2 is the family film to end all family films (sans The Lion
King, which is untouchable). It's a profound masterpiece of wit and
truth that should exhilirate kids and non-snobbish adults (read: those
who don't mind being touched by messages a ten-year-old can grasp)
alike. It's wholesome entertainment, alright -- the best example of it
in years -- but it doesn't take the form of a preachy diatribe like so
many "lesson movies" have over the years, instead, the filmmakers
devote their efforts to giving us a rollicking good time. We got it.
Produced by the enormously successful Pixar Disney division, this is
the sequel (duh) to the (almost) equally terrific 1995 hit Toy Story.
While the two certainly have some plot similarities, I was impressed at
just how different this was; like the best sequels, it expands on the
concept of the original rather than merely retreading it. It involves a
rescue mission, just like the first one, but this time, we go to
Infinity and Beyond. You see, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks has been stolen
by "Big Al" (Wayne Knight) because apparently, Woody is a valuable
doll. In fact a long time ago, Woody even had his own tv show, he just
didn't know it. Now, he and three companion toys are to be sent away
for display in a museum.
It's up to Buzz Lightyear and his pals to rescue Woody from Big Al's
materialistic grasp, and for that, they must journey 19 blocks (!) and
seek out "Big Al's Toy Barn," a Toys R' Us-ish plaything megastore.
This leads to a genius scene in the toy store itself, with a Buzz
impostor, a Barbie tourguide and, of course, a Darth Vader-style
supervillain. It's not long before they realize that the place where
woody is hidden is actually across the street in Big Al's office and go
there -- only to be followed by Buzz Lightyear's arch nemesis.
Meanwhile, Woody faces a spectacularly profound moral dilemma: should
he stay with his new friends and go to the museum, where he will
probably be marveled at forever or should he try to go back to Andy
who, in all likelyhood, will get over his affection for him and throw
him away before long? This has more substance than most "adult" movies
can even hope for -- certainly more thoughtful and complex than some of
this year's "deep" movies, like Fight Club or The Insider -- and it is
developed beautifully, not letting a single opportunity go to waste.
Gracefully, it speaks to children about faith, loyalty, decision
making, abandonment and more in one fell swoop. It talks to them on
their level, without condescending, simplifying or spelling anything
out; it respects their intelligence and ours. Ergo, adults can
appreciate it even more than their kids.
Pixar's computer animation, though it has lost some of its novelty
since the breakthrough of the original Toy Story, is still rapidly
developing, and Toy Story 2 takes it to new heights. After Antz and A
Bug's Life took the computer graphics so close to reality that we
thought it couldn't get any richer, this new flick takes it yet another
step further. The characters are so real that they're surreal, as if
we're in a parallel universe rather than a cartoon. It's a marvelous
experience, akin to being given a peek of a new world we've never seen
before and may never see again.
Besides being profound, Toy Story 2 is exceptionally witty, with adult-
oriented jabs at Star Wars, Barbie, tv remote controls, et al. It's a
nice reversal from 1999's earlier Disney animated feature Tarzan, which
had almost nothing to engage adults. This recalls the wonderful
Hercules, which threw more mature gags at the audience (the "Grecian
Express" credit card?) fast enough to make my head spin.
Is "masterpiece" too strong a word for Toy Story 2? Is it appropriate
to use that moniker for a family movie? My answers are no and yes. See
the movie and come up with your own but don't dismiss it because it's a
cartoon.

Title
Review for Liberty Heights (1999)
Starring Adrian Brody, Ben Foster, Orlando Jones, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe
Mantegna, Rebekah Johnson, David Krumholtz. Richard Klein, Justin
Chambers, Charley Scalies. Rated R.
Aside from making occasionally intelligent crowd-pleasers such as
Sphere, Wag the Dog and Rain Man, Barry Levinson also directed four
lesser-known films known as his "Baltimore movies," all of them
focusing on the life of Jewish people in 50s Baltimore. Those films --
Diner, Tin Men, Avalon and now Liberty Heights -- have all been met
with critical plaudits but little in terms of box-office; what allowed
Levinson to keep making them was his respected Hollywood stature. I'm
sure he called on some favors to get some of these movies financed. But
while the 3rd film, Avalon, was clearly not a populist movie, the
influence of the profit-minded studios has taken its toll on Liberty
Heights; it tries too hard to attract an audience by pitching itself to
the lowest common denominator.
Despite a colorful assortment of supporting characters, the film's main
focus is Ben and Van Kurtzman (Ben Foster and Adrian Brody,
respectively), two Jewish teens struggling with the prejudices that
plague Baltimore in the 1950s. They struggle desperately to fit in,
going to non-Jewish parties where they are not welcome, doing
everything they can not to reveal their nationality. The prejudices
against them have made their parents prejudiced; when Ben says that he
finds a "colored" girl attractive, his mom (Bebe Neuwirth)
exclaims "Just kill me now!"
Ben does indeed develop a relationship with a colored girl and Van
falls hard for a gorgeous, Cinderella-white Christian girl, who also
happens to be going out with a (thankfully) benevolent Christian guy
(Justin Chambers) who decides to help Van out. Meanwhile Ben and Van's
father, who run an illegal gambling operation, get into money trouble
with small-time drug dealer Little Melvin, who might just go on the
offensive against the Kurtzman family should he not get his money on
time.
There is a riotous scene in the beginning of the movie where Ben
decides to dress like Hitler for Halloween. His mom flips and calls his
father, who adamantly tells her that Ben shall not go out like that,
and asks to "speak to the Fuhrer." Ben's mom gives him the phone and he
begins with a distinctive "Jaaaaaaaa?" Well, you had to be there. The
scene is hilarious, and I was only hoping the film would continue with
that sort of witty, intelligent humor, but no such luck: it soon
deteriorates into potty jokes American Pie style, obviously inserted to
attract the young crowd that may not otherwise be interested in a movie
about race relations 45 years ago.
Beyond the often immature facade is hidden a touching, good-hearted
movie about growing up, being different and having a cosmopolitan
attitude towards people. It ain't deep stuff, but it's heartfelt,
sincere and, despite the touchy subject matter, often sweet. It's about
the people more than it's about the situations they're in; we're
supposed to watch the characters' reactions rather than analyze their
surroundings.
The performances are solid across the board; no Oscar contenders here,
but some enjoyable turns from some good actors. Joe Mantegna is
typically good as Ben and Van's troubled father. He isn't as lively,
perhaps, as he is in some of his other performances, but then again
he's hardly supposed to be. Adrian Brody probably isn't the best actor
for his role -- I'd kill to see, say, David Krumholtz (who plays
Brody's clutzy friend) take the part instead. The highlight of the
performances is relative newcomer Ben Foster, who bites into his role
with humorous, irreverent gusto (I love that word!).
I enjoyed the movie, dirty jokes and all, though I couldn't help
thinking that, in this case, less is more. Levinson has the basic idea,
now he has to parrot down: cut the potty humor, add more genuine wit
and tell the studio executives insisting on material that would entice
teens to go screw themselves.

Title
Review for Boys Don't Cry (1999)
Starring Hilary Swank, Chloë Sevigny, Peter Sarsgaard, Brendan Sexton
III. Directed by Kimberly Peirce. Rated R (Warning: This movie is on
the outer boundaries of the R rating. Don't take aunt Helen).
Boys Don't Cry is a brutal, often painful to watch the biopic of Teena
Brandon, a teenage girl who dressed up as a boy, lied to a girl, mixed
in with the wrong crowd and got brutally raped and murdered. In a year
when Hollywood adaptations of true stories -- some truthful than,
controversially, others -- dominated critics' top ten list, this may
have been the only one I truly liked, though "enjoyed" is the wrong
word to use here.
This is a situation movie, where there is a set-up and then events are
allowed to progress on their natural course without an honest-to-
goodness storyline. In what is easily the year's most lauded
performance, Hilary Swank plays Teena Brandon who, as I've mentioned,
dresses up as a boy and makes friends with a group of trailer-trashy
folk with family problems and what seem like outgoing personalities.
Specifically, Teena falls in love with Lana (Chloë Sevigny), a
beautiful young woman stuck in the middle of a dysfunctional family and
trapped in a town where she has no future.
Teena and Lana form a nice relationship, but they have to deal with
Lana's family, who will not stand for the idea of a boy pretending to
be a girl should they ever find out the truth. In real life, of course,
they did find out the truth and the results were tragic.
For better or for worse, depending on the viewer, Boys Don't Cry does
not spare us the details. The final scenes become painful to watch --
we want to turn away but we don't dare. Director Kimberly Peirce
portrays the final event in all its crushing realisticity, refusing to
soften things up for those who can't stomach them. Many reviews have
had this caveat and I will say it again: Boys Don't Cry is not for the
squeamish. It is rated R but could easily have received an NC-17. Use
caution.
Not surprisingly, the movie has received uniformly bad reviews from the
wacky, inimitable Christian Right. Hardly surprising, considering the
film's liberal good intentions. It is decidedly pro-homosexuality,
though I hate to put such a simplistic label on a movie as good as this
one. Reading some reviews for it, I was surprised that people can hate
it so much just because they disagree with it.
The reason that Boys Don't Cry has received so much media attention is
simple: Hilary Swank. She is, indeed, phenomenal -- not only successful
in playing a girl-turned-boy but also in lodging her character deep in
our hearts, a place she will remain in for a long time. What's less
fortunate, perhaps, is that she casts a long shadow on her equally
amazing co-star Chloë Sevigny. At once gorgeous, approachable and, in
the end, powerfully poignant, Sevigny was nominated for an Best
Supporting Actress Oscar. Despite the awards recognition, when people
talk about Boys Don't Cry, the name Hilary Swank always comes up; her
co-star is all but forgotten.
The film is, in some ways, expressing rage against intolerance but it's
too good a movie to act as a propaganda machine. In the end, of course,
it comes back to this central theme but rather than preach through the
whole movie, the filmmakers take us on a journey through a world we may
not realize that we live in. Indeed, in a perfect world, this movie
wouldn't had to have been made. Unfortunately, this is not a perfect
world and the absorbing, daring Boys Don't Cry points out one of its
flaws.

Review for American Pie (1999)
Starring Jason Biggs, Thomas DeLonge, Mark Hoppus, Travis Barker, Chris
Klein, Eugene Levy, Thomas Ian Nichols, Natasha Lyonne. Rated R.
Hollywood has been buzzing about American Pie for months, with early
rumors comparing it with There's Something About Mary and claiming that
it "pushes the envelope" with regard to outrageousness. They were wrong.
It doesn't push the envelope: it throws the envelope at you, and damned
if it doesn't work.
This is unquestionably a teen film but the plot is enough to make
parents wince: a group of high school seniors make a pact that each of
them will lose their virginity by graduation time in order to avoid
potential embarassment in college. There's barely a few weeks left and
for most of them it looks like prom night is their last hope. Each of
them tries to devise their own plan to reach their goal, and some of
those plans have unexpected consequences.
Of course there has to be some experimentation before they get to the
real thing, so one of the protagonists asks "what third base feels
like," and the response he gets is "like sweet warm, apple pie." When he
comes home and finds a delicious looking apple pie on the kitchen table,
what happens is anyone's guess. In another, equally gross scene, another
one of the characters "inherits" a sex bible, made by high school
seniors for high school seniors and passed down each year to another
deserving candidate. He learns something new to try on his girlfriend
called "The Tongue Tornado", which I won't (and can't) describe here.
First time director Chris Weitz (who co-wrote the film with brother Paul
Weitz, the two also wrote Antz, one of last year's best films) first
throws every trick in the book at you, then he throws the book and then
starts hurling random objects (including that envelope I mentioned
earlier) at the speed of a very large rabbit on steroids. He invariably
gets the audience hooting, applauding and -- oh yeah -- laughing their
hearts out. His jokes are disgusting and juvenile but also hilarious,
even though we're not often proud of what we're laughing at. That, too,
can be taken as a virtue: it takes talent to make us laugh at something
we find vulgar, profane and gross.
The acting is of no importance in a movie like this, but what is present
here is more than passable. Newcomer Jason Biggs is palatably insecure
in what is probably the most significant role in the movie. Natasha
Lyonne (whom we first saw in Slums of Beverly Hills) is delightful in a
disappointingly minor role.
I'm not quite sure that I like the ending of American Pie. It's
needlessly shallow, and I predict that Conservative activist groups will
never let the filmmakers hear the end of it. But despite the movie's
eventual fallacy, there is no ignoring its merits. It's a hilarious,
affectionate look at teenagers' obsession with sex. While it's not
exactly substantial and thematically sound, it'll sure as hell do.
What we have here is one of the rudest and crudest films I've seen this
side of Pink Flamingoes. What we have here is one of the funniest films
I've seen this side of the Austin Powers franchise and some of Mel
Brooks' work. What we have here is a rollicking comic delight, an eye-
popping gross out and a terrific summer film.

Title
Review for Love Letter, The (1999)
 Starring Kate Capshaw, Tom Everett Scott, Blythe Danner, Tom Selleck,
Ellen DeGeneres. Rated PG-13.
It's actually not so bad that Dreamworks decided to release The Love
Letter at about the same time as Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom
Menace, because this way less people will have to sit through this
dreadful little comedy. And no, I really don't feel guilty about wishing
this movie death at the box-office. Really, I don't. Not at all.
The plot has been done before -- a mysterious, unaddressed love letter
shows up in a small town, causing confusion for everyone who reads it.
The center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner Helen (Kate
Capshaw, and by the way, what is it with bookstore owner main
characters? In the past year and a half we've seen them in Life is
Beautiful, You've Got Mail, this movie, and the upcoming Notting Hill),
who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore. She
immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from, and
comes to the (incorrect) conclusion that the author of the note is a
young employee played by Tom Everett Scott. He, reading the letter
himself, assumes that she wrote it for him.
After a while, they fall in love (well, duh). Kate feels guilty about
getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger
than her, and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also
involved with the town fireman (Tom Selleck). To add to her turmoil, her
mother shows up (Blythe Danner, who apparently must have had her
daughter when she was about 9) and her trusted bookstore manager
(deadpan Ellen DeGeneres) quits.
Supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing. Their
purpose isn't just to move the plot along, they're also supposed to give
the storyline a backbone. To do this, they must exhibit at least
marginal depth and must also be interesting. Rarely can a movie work if
it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with
hackneyed, dull, cardboard secondary characters, especially when at the
core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them.
This is The Love Letter's damning error. Capshaw's character is as good
as I have seen present in recent romantic comedies, but the people that
surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional.
Because of that, The Love Letter is awkward and insincere. Even worse --
it's a bore. I liked Capshaw and her Helen, but everyone else is
painfully fake, undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has
the potential to exist. There is nothing particularly hilarious about
all this either -- and besides DeGeneres' wisecracks, there's little
that is even a little amusing.
This is not a completely thoughtless film and director Peter Ho-Sun Chan
does a good job of portraying Helen's yearnings and various subtle
complexities. But it's far from profound. There isn't a common theme
running through the proceedings, thus the movie seems thoughtfully
pointless.
Really, this is a harmless little movie; it's far from an abomination
and it's not torturous to sit through. But bad, it is. Awful, it also
is. The Love Letter is a failure, and an inane failure at that.

Title
Review for Three Kings (1999)
 "Are we shooting?"
Starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube, Spike Jonze, Nora
Dunn, Jamie Kennedy. Rated R.
If Three Kings is a comedy, it's the most important one since Dr.
Strangelove. It is being vociferously promoted as a "war comedy," and to
a certain extent, I suppose it is one. It is decidely not satire and it
is far from the offbeat, poignant humor of Life is Beautiful. No -- the
comedy here is rather broad (though definitely not dumb). The amazing
thing is not that it manages to be funny without being stupid but that
it effectively balances an inordinate amount of humor with intelligent,
subtle political and social commentary. It's an unrestrained, riveting
film, three-dimentional and skillfully made. It's in the spirit of
M*A*S*H, but not really.
It's also the second movie ever to deal with The Gulf War (Courage Under
Fire being the first). Actually, it takes place immediately after the
war, when groups of American soldiers are hanging out in Iraq during the
just-declared ceasefire. Bored and thinking of their families, four of
these soldiers decide to go on a renegade mission. After finding a map
in the unlikeliest of places, Archie Gates (George Clooney), Troy Barlow
(Mike Wahlberg), Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) and Vig (Spike Jonze) leave
their base without authorization to look for some gold. This isn't just
any gold: this is gold that Saddam stole from the people of Kuwait.
Kuwait wants it back, understandably, but the foursome have no intention
of returning it. Instead, they hope to strike it rich so when they
return home neither they nor their families would have to worry about
money ever again.
Let's backtrack for a second. As the movie opens, Mark Wahlberg walks on
to the screen, looks at the camera and yells "Are we shooting?" For
those in doubt about just what he is talking about (and it's a neat
trick, foreshadowing the unconventional experience we are about to
have), he backs up his question with "Are we shooting people, or what?"
You see, none of these soldiers have seen any "action" during their
whole involvment in the war, so when, in the film's opening sequence,
they get to shoot an Iraqi soldier they take a sick pleasure in it. One
of them remarks "I didn't think I'd get to see anyone get shot in this
war. Take a picture."
Be careful what you wish for -- you just might get it. The "action" they
were looking for would come after the war was over. They come to look
for the gold in the remains of a village. There, they discover Saddam's
troops attacking Iraqis who decided to rebel against Saddam, just like
George Bush instructed. They are not allowed to do anything about it due
to the ceasefire. Archie's humane instincts prevail over his military
common sense, however, and the four Americans wind up being the ones
responsible for breaking the ceasefire and the ones stuck with the
cumbersome task of transporting refugees to the Iranian border in order
to get the gold they so desperately want.
Three Kings is about priorities. What are our priorities as a nation?
What would happen if a soldier's priorities differed from those of his
nation? Whose is he to follow? These questions are posed in a superb,
solidly constructed storyline with brilliant, funny dialogue and
exciting action sequences. This is a movie where everything seems to
work; all the elements come together to make a convincing, brilliant
whole.
The standout performance, surprisingly, is that of Ice Cube who manages
to turn a minor, seemingly insignificant character into one of the most
interesting and compelling in the film. For possibly the first time in
his feature film career, George Clooney is also outstanding;
appropriately energetic and darkly funny. Wahlberg plays the most
volatile of our four protagonists, and he does it with an almost Woody
Allen-ish level of neurosis: paranoid, self-absorbed and always looking
for the solution most profitable to himself.
Directed by David O. Russell (Flirting With Disaster), this movie is
sometimes brutally violent, but those scenes are staged in such creative
ways and are so fluid and exciting that with a few exceptions, we barely
notice. Russell uses an interesting method a few times throughout Three
Kings in which he uses a real cadaver to "demonstrate" what happens when
a bullet pierces a certain part of the human body. Though this elicited
some groans from the audience, those not weak of stomach are likely to
find the effect "cool." I'm not sure I disliked this eccentric (if
that's the right word) little trick, but I'm equally not sure how it fit
in with the rest of the film.
Three Kings is exhilirating and smart, a great film which manages to
involve us in the action and make us think. It's a better war drama than
a certain overrated 1998 Steven Spielberg movie (all right, Saving
Private Ryan), a better comedy than Life is Beautiful and one of the
very best films I've seen this year.

Title
Review for Tumbleweeds (1999)
Starring Janet McTeer, Kimberly Brown, Gavin O'Connor. Rated PG-13.
Tumbleweeds is very much an actor's movie, one with little going for it
besides the potential for tour de force performances. The script,
indeed, is a thespian's dream, complete with explosive domestic abuse
scenes, teary-eyed monologues and screaming fits aplenty. The
performances from the small-name cast are some of the year's best, an
Oscar goldmine, but the movie itself is predictable and simple.
Certainly not bad, as bad movies go; I was never bored and often times
I found myself engrossed. Still, as one of the characters in it would
probably say, this ain't no gem.
The movie opens with Mary Jo Walker (Janet McTeer, a renowned stage
veteran and Tony Award winner) having a brutal fight with her husband.
He chases her around the kitchen, knocking things over, as she taunts
him to give her a big bruise in the eye "so [her] lawyer can see it."
Right away, she sticks her head into her daughter Ava's room and tells
her to "pack up, we're leavin'!" Ava is way ahead of her, her suitcase
is already half packed and with a roll of the eyes and a groan she gets
into the car and they take off.
You see, this is Mary Jo's fourth marriage and she has had more than
her share of experiences with abusive husbands. She and Ava have moved
around a lot. Ava is sick to death of it and just wants to settle down
in one place, with a father figure or, preferably, without, go to
school, make friends and live a normal life. No can do -- her mother is
a veritable jackass magnet: every guy she marries gets violent with her.
So Ava persuades Mary Jo to move to San Diego, which Ava falls in love
with. They get there. Mary Jo gets a boring but seemingly lucrative
job. Ava goes to school and makes friends. Everything is perfect until
Mary Jo makes really good friends with a sexy trucker named Jack (Gavin
O'Connor, who -- I couldn't believe it, from the looks of the guy --
also directed) and faster than you can say "divorce" they've moved in
together. The relationship seems to be just right at first -- it always
does. But soon we get little hints that everything is not as dandy as
it should be. First, Jack gets really miffed that Mary Jo didn't ask
her about his day. Then he almost has a contusion because of the low
quality of her goulash. Before she knows it he's throwing a hissy fit
in a restaurant.
The characters are attentively developed, interesting and involving.
We're immediately engaged in Mary Jo and Anna's relationship and
dilemma. We grow to hate Jack just as much. There's a distinctively
human quality to these people and that allows for an entry point into
the movie, a place where we can emotionally attach ourselves and then
watch the rest of the movie from that particular viewpoint.
The problem, to the extent that there is one, is that we know how the
movie will end as soon as one of the supporting characters smiles. With
such an interesting array of players, it's a shame to see a script take
such a painfully standard course of action. The experience, then, is a
strange one: we basically know everything that is going to happen
before it actually does and yet we somehow enjoy it. There isn't a
single positive thing I could say about the storyline itself; it's all
in the characterization.
Janet McTeer is terrific in a role that fits her like a glove. She
manages to be imposing and caring at the same time adding a level of
depth to her relationship with her daughter. The daughter is played by
newcomer Kimberly Brown in an intelligent, precocity-free performance.
Also turning in an impressive performance is O'Connor, who is
formidable and rather frightening: just the note his character is
supposed to hit.
Tumbleweeds lacks any real insight into love or life and it certainly
isn't rife with surprises and originality. It is involving and
entertaining, working an all the levels it was supposed to in the first
place. Nothing new, but I'll take it.

Title
Review for Mystery, Alaska (1999)
"The Rangers taking their off-time to go to some cold village and play
pond hockey with eskimos: it's a joke!"
Starring Russell Crowe, Burt Reynolds, Colm Meaney, Hank Azaria, Mary
McKormick, Lolita Davidovich, Maury Chaykin. Rated R.
After watching Mystery, Alaska, I decided to do a little research. I
ventured over to the Internet Movie Database, the premier source of
movie information on the net, to test a theory. I searched for movies
and tv series about hockey, baseball, football, and basketball. When I
searched for baseball, it returned 145 movies and tv shows. Football
gave me 145 and basketball came up with 68. But when I did a search on
hockey, the result was a measly 44 references. Why is hockey so
underrepresented in pop culture? Hard to say, but while audiences seem
to be tired of sports movies of late, a hockey film or two is not
unwelcome, provided it doesn't have the words "Mighty Ducks" in the
title.
Mystery, Alaska is a hockey town. Life revolves around the "Saturday
Game", a weekly pond hockey match-up. It's not a competition. They
don't keep score. The teams are decided at random. The game is more
than a tradition: it's a legend, a way of life. A veteran of
the "Saturday Game", John Biebe, who has played for some thirteen years
is about to be honorably discharged. He's a good player, but he is
getting old and his agility on skates isn't what it used to be. He has
to be liquidated to make room for an ambitious up-and-comer, a lighting-
fast high-schooler with relationship issues.
Just then, a cocky former Mystery resident who has abandoned the town
for a career in Hollywood returns -- on a helicopter, no less. But he
doesn't come empty-handed. He brings word that the New York Rangers are
going to fly to Alaska for a game of pond hockey with the "Mystery
Boys". It seems some genius at the National Hockey League had an idea
for some good, cheap promotion: why not fly the league's premier hockey
team to the middle of nowhere and have them play a sort of charity game
with mysterious "Eskimos"?
But not so fast. It seems the Rangers aren't too keen about taking
their precious free time to play pond hockey in Alaska. The players'
union files a grievance demanding that the arrangement be cancelled,
and Mystery sends their lawyer (Maury Chaykin) to represent the town
and hopefully maintain what dignity they have left. As if that wasn't
enough, crises arise in the homeland as well. The team needs a coach.
The town Mayor (Colm Meaney) wants John to do it as a sort of
retribution, but John wants to play, thereby pressing the old hockey
expert/town judge (Burt Reynolds) to take the job.
Mystery, Alaska is not only full of cliches, it clings to them as if
they were lifeblood. I don't take notes when I watch movies, but I wish
I had brought a notepad and a pen for this one just so I could write
down at least a significant portion of the countless examples of idea
recycling that goes on in this movie. To name a few: kids spontaneously
cursing for laughs, a guy who piles an inordinate amount of [fill in
food here; in this case, mashed potatoes] onto his plate when he is
distracted during dinner, a guy watching sports during sex and
screaming out when a goal is scored, and of course, the obligatory "Big
Game" ending, which we know can turn out one of two ways. I'll leave it
to you to guess which one is used here.
I've always thought of director Jay Roach as some kind of weird genius.
He is the man behind the legend that is Austin Powers and its sequel.
Both are delightful, no-holds-barred comedic masterpieces, always
reveling in their own outrageousness. With Mystery, Alaska, Roach tries
to get accustomed to the limitations of a more conventional narrative
and he doesn't always succeed. I'm not saying that he is incapable of
making good "standard" movies, far from it, I'm sure that if given the
right project he could very well extend his range. But here, working
from a script by tv vet David E. Kelley, he wants to burst out. As a
matter of fact, he finds some outlets to do just that, one of them
being -- whe else? -- Mike Myers, having oodles of fun with an
exaggerated Canadian dialect as a smarmy hockey commentator. There are
times when you sense the Jay Roach from Austin Powers coming out of the
woodwork, and those tend to be the high points. But for much of the
movie he has to restrain himself, and with a script as average as this
one it feels forced.
Nevertheless the film stays afloat. There is something about its pure,
well-intentioned affection for hockey that won me over. If, to a sports
movie, the game it's portraying is nothing more than a part of a
formula, it will not work, which is why none of the three Mighty Ducks
movies ever went anywhere. But when we feel a love for the sport, the
oldest of formulas can seem almost as good as new.

Title
Review for Outside Providence (1999)
Starring Shawn Hatosy, Alec Baldwin, Amy Smart. Rated R.
Those who believed the ads trying to convince the American Public that
Outside Providence is another There's Something About Mary are in for a
shock. It bears no resemblance to the horrifyingly popular 1998 gross-
out laugh-fest; unfortunately it's not anywhere near as good, either.
It's meant to be an outrageous coming-of-age comedy, but the laughs are
few and far between. As for the coming-of-age part, let's just say it is
beaten out in that department by The Thirteenth Warrior.
The reason behind all of the comparisons is that Outside Providence was
scripted by Peter Farrelly, one of the men responsible for Mary. However
the film is directed by Michael Corrente (American Buffalo) and doesn't
have Mary's take-no-prisoners attitude. That's the problem: it is more
interested in lackluster drama rather than comedy.
The concept itself isn't particularly tantalizing: the film is about
Timothy Dunphy a.k.a. "Dildo", a deadbeat, troublemaking high-schooler
who is sent to a fancy prep school by his father (Alec Baldwin). He
doesn't seem to fit in: he is surrounded by smart kids while he himself
isn't particularly bright; he likes getting stoned but though some of
his schoolmates do as well, they, unlike him, know that studying is
important. It gets worse when he meets opposition from the typically
evil schoolmaster (Timothy Crowe); an authority figure intent on
catching Timothy breaking a rule.
Of course Tim meets a girl. Of course Tim likes the girl. And, of
course, he gets the girl in trouble and has to figure out whether to
save her ass and put his on the line or whether to walk away happy and
leave his dear Jane (Amy Smart) in the hole. That's the coming-of-age
portion of the film... will Tim take responsibility for his own actions
or will he remain a freeloader, potentially for the rest of his life?
This is the kind of movie where I leave the theater in a bad mood -- not
because I hated what I just saw, but because it was sheer mediocrity
from beginning to end. Outside Providence didn't fill me with dislike,
as a matter of fact, it failed to evoke any sort of cognizable emotional
reaction from me. I laughed a couple of times. Smiled a few. Nothing
more. The movie built up a little dramatic momentum at a few points.
Nothing more. I didn't hate the film. Part of me wishes I did.
The only way to fix this mess would be to go to the core of the problem:
the script. It tries to balance comedy and drama and fails; as a result
we get a movie that isn't very funny or very, um, dramatic. There are a
few moments in Outside Providence when I was wishing for the script to
take a particular gag or concept farther. The subplot about the
schoolmaster demonstrates this perfectly: the man is almost the villain
in the story; almost a funny caricature. If the film was going to go in
this direction, I thought to myself, why not go all the way?. Why not go
a step further and make it genuinely funny? Instead, it stopped short;
chickened out, if you will.
Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty) is as unexceptional as everything else in
Outside Providence. He looks so stoned throughout the first two-thirds
of the movie that when we get to the point where we are supposed to
believe that his Tim is a changed man, we can't. Amy Smart's (Starship
Troopers) whole performance is the good-girl-with-a-wild-side cliche; a
shame since her character is so central to the plot.
I suppose this isn't such a bad film. I've seen worse. Outside
Providence is a movie where everything that is tried fails to rise above
the merely adequate. To have made the film better it would have to have
been completely revamped, something big-shot Peter Farrelly would
probably never have permitted: this has been his pet project. I don't
know why. As I said, there's nothing remotely tantalizing about the idea
or the final result. It isn't horrible, either. It's just... there. And
that sucks.

Title
Review for Arlington Road (1999)
Starring Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Hope David, Joan Cusack. Rated R.
As I write this, nearly two days after the screening, Arlington Road is
still a haunting and vivid image in my memory. I suspect it will stay
with me for some time. Director Mark Pellington delivers one of the
scariest, smartest, most daring thrillers I've seen in recent memory, a
thoughtful yet horrifyingly intense meditation on human nature.
Jeff Bridges, who has shown his remarkable versatility as an actor with
his roles in The Big Lebowski and now this, stars as Michael Faraday, a
jittery man who teaches a class on terrorism at a local university. His
wife, an FBI agent, died a few years prior because the Bureau gave her
faulty information on a terrorist suspect. He now lives with his son
and, on occasion, his girlfriend (Hope Davis).
Across the street from them live five seemingly ordinary people: Oliver
and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack, respectively) with their
three children. At first, Michael tries to be friendly, frequently
visiting and assuring that his kid interacts with theirs. But it isn't
long before he starts noticing strange things around their household:
suspicious blueprints, strange mail and other extraordinary goings-on.
Soon, Faraday launches a one man investigation into Oliver Lang's past,
finding out that he changed his name to the name of the person who died
the day before and that he was caught up in a pipe bomb incident at the
tender age of 16.
Faraday begins to suspect conspiracy while everyone around him is
convinced that he has gone off the deep end. With his extensive
knowledge of terrorism, he is determined to discover the secret behind
his peculiar neighbors. But is there anything to discover?
Arlington Road is a film about denial. We clamor for a sense of personal
security and when that is taken away from us we, as a people, are
willing to drastically mislead ourselves to get it back. This movie says
that there is no conspicuous end to our self-delusion. Those who dare to
stand up and argue that the conclusions we so deliberately come to are
wrong are immediately labeled paranoid, perhaps even crazy. In that
sense, this is a staggeringly brilliant cautionary tale.
Aside from that, it's also an insanely suspenseful thriller. With tour
de force cinematography, a stunningly effective (although fairly
standard) soundtrack and intriguing scene set-ups, Arlington Road
generated such pure, unadulterated tension that I must admit I was taken
aback. In the best Hitchcock tradition, here's a movie that not only
entertains and keeps you glued to the screen in the immediate present
but one that also carries enough weight to remain in your memory for a
significant amount of time after you throw away that empty popcorn
bucket.
Jeff Bridges gives a virtuoso performance as the desperate Faraday. He
is the perfect action hero: a character without a hint of pretension who
acts on instinct alone. Bridges plays Faraday as a despairing person and
succeeds in making him a sympathetic character. Tim Robbins, heretofore
underused in dramatic roles, is absolutely chilling as the ominous
neighbor while Joan Cusack as Robbins' wife continues to show us why she
is one of the most talented actresses in the business.
I will not reveal the ending, but I will say that it is the perfect
example of why I love going to the movies. It is exactly the kind of
daring, unapologetic conclusion that shows me that there are still
people in the mainstream movie business willing to go against popular
convention. Pellington and writer Ehren Kruger (the upcoming Scream 3)
saw an opportunity to solidify the film's point and went for it without
wimping out.
It's a shame that Arlington Road is destined to get lost in the shuffle
with all the big blockbusters because it is (so far) the year's best
film. Only the best of filmmakers and performers can make me so
completely suspend my disbelief and get me involved in the action and
the folks involved with this production did just that. A pessimistic
cautionary tale, this is a movie that has all the potential of a great
movie and, for once is able to realize it.

Review for Straight Story, The (1999)
Starring Richard Farnsworth, Sissy Spacek. Rated G.
Sometimes I think Hollywood no longer knows how to make real movies.
Not everything has to be slam-bang and in-your-face. How quickly we
forget that eloquence and quiet tenacity can be far more satisfying
than disturbing images and big time special effects. As great as
American Beauty was, I'm not sure I would want to live on a steady diet
of pessimism and angst. As transporting an experience as The Matrix
was, there's only so much room in my brain for mind-blowing kung fu.
What I want -- and what I haven't seen much of lately -- is a film that
is beautiful, good-natured, powerful in its own quiet way without
getting in my face with its morals.
David Lynch's The Straight Story is just such a movie. In the best
Lynch tradition, it's an eccentric but approachable true story about
growing older and shooting for the stars. Corny stuff? You betcha. But
only the best stalks are used.
79 year-old Richard Farnsworth plays 73 year-old Alvin Straight, a
crippled old man living in Iowa with his slightly "slow" daughter Rose
(Sissy Spacek). One day Alvin gets word that his brother Lyle, whom he
has not talked to for decades has just had a stroke. Alvin makes up his
mind to go see Lyle, who lives in the neighboring state of Wisconsin,
300 miles away. Trouble is, Alvin does not have a driver's license
because of his poor vision, and his daughter can't drive. But Alvin
isn't ready to give up so easily. He takes his 1964 John Deere tractor
lawn mower and sets of on a pilgrimage at 5 miles an hour.
Along the way, Alvin meets Midwestern eccentrics. Some are in awe at
his mode of transportation, some are impressed at the distance he has
covered, many think he is just plain crazy. When his mower breaks down,
a benevolent couple offers to drive him the rest of the way to his
brother's house. But he refuses. He wanted to finish this trip himself,
his own way, to round out his life with an achievement which would give
him a sense of self-satisfaction, a feeling that he has done something
truly valuable, something he will be remembered for long after he
passes away.
The Straight Story claims to be based on real events. It shouldn't
have. Such a claim, in retrospect, cheapens this magical movie,
detracting from the sense of wonder that it inspires in us. It's better
to think of this as a glorious fantasy. But either way it's a great
film. The epitome of pleasantness, it will be a hit with those
audiences wise enough to seek it out. But aside from being a crowd-
pleaser, it's also a profound, touching drama.
With his sad eyes and intelligent face, Richard Farnsworth can be
credited with bringing pathos to the screenplay. Sissy Spacek, probably
best known still for her role in Carrie, is just as good; her role is
poignant and, speech impediment and all, she plays it for devastating
effect.
But the film's brilliance doesn't really lie in the performances,
excellent as they may be. You've heard critics call other movies "The
antidote to summer blockbusters," I'm sure. Nonsense. All nonsense. If
you see this movie, you will agree. If this isn't the antidote to
Hollywood blockbusters, such a thing does not exist. By its very
nature, it's anti-Hollywood. Its pace, its atmosphere, its plot all
bear no resemblance to anything I have seen come out of Hollywood
previously. It's a surprise to me that Walt Disney, the distributor,
agreed to even touch this film. It never had a chance of making any
real money. That doesn't make it any less extraordinary or refreshing.
Often the best films are acknowledged as definite future box-office
flops as early as pre-production.
Technically, this is as adept a film as I've seen this year, with a
gorgeous score, deft camerawork and beautiful cinematography. David
Lynch manages to make the sight of cornfields and a guy riding a lawn
mower genuinely breathtaking. The soothing soundtrack, composed by
Angelo Badalamenti (who also scored Arlington Road, another of my
favorites this year), adds to the gloriously docile atmosphere; the
same theme repeats over and over, becoming more hypnotic each time
around. By the end of The Straight Story I was not only involved in the
characters, I was also mesmerized by the film itself.
Above all, this is a family movie, one to take your kids to and then
talk about with them afterwards. Don't expect excitement, action or big
laughs. It's not that kind of movie. Instead, expect wholesome
entertainment for all ages, a heartwarming, touching story about aging
and following your heart. This is truly an antidote to the Hollywood
blockbuster.

Review for Leggenda del pianista sull'oceano, La (1998)
 "The world on land -- it's just too big for me."
Starring Tim Roth, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Bill Nunn, Clarence Williams
III. Rated R.
The Legend of 1900s is the year's most absurd movie, a rambling,
nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast. It stars
thespian extraordinaire Tim Roth, looking wistful as ever, as a guy
named... 1900. You heard right. His name is, in all actuality, 1900. He
was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 (uh, hence the name), abandoned
and adopted by Danny, a ship crewman. 1900 spends most of his early
years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of Danny's fear that he
might be taken away from him because of "visa matters."
Well, when 1900 is about 9 or so, he starts wondering all around the
ship. One day, he discovers a grand piano. He sits down and starts
playing. Miraculously, what comes out is beautiful. A group of
onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing
music at such a young age. When one of the people who knows 1900 tells
him that his playing the piano like that without permission is "totally
against regulations" 1900 replies "F*ck the regulations!" Ho ho ho.
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land. When he's about 30ish and
can play the piano like nobody's business, onboard comes another
musician. His name is Max (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and he plays the
trumpet. After 1900 catches Max barfing everywhere during a storm, he
sits him down on the piano next to him, takes the piano's braces off
and plays while the piano flies all around the hall, taking them with
it. How the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate, I
don't know, but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed
to ask.
After that, 1900 and Max become friends. Max is determined to get 1900
off the ship and discover what he is missing on land, but 1900 has no
intention of doing so. What's more, he doesn't even want his music to
go anywhere without him: when a record company hears about his talents,
they come on board to make a record of his music, but after finding out
that -- gasp! -- they're going to make millions of copies, he breaks
the record.
The conflict of the movie is that after Max, unsuccessful in his
endeavor to get 1900 off the ship, gets off himself, he stumbles upon a
record of 1900's music in a store. The record shouldn't exist because
a) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b) the one record that was made
on the ship was broken. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a mystery!
The story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its
elements. We're supposed to be roused by a climactic... piano duel?
There isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel. 1900
comes off as a whiny, brooding, extremely unlikable man: I can't recall
a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo-
meditation on life. Ditto for Max, who doesn't seem to have a life
outside his friendship with 1900.
Tim Roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf; there's
no spirit, no gusto to the character. He insists that he leads a happy
life on the ship, but to us he is dead. Pruitt Taylor Vince is a little
more palatable, at least providing a moment of comic relief here and
there to liven things up a bit. The highlight of the movie would have
to be the eminently amusing Clarence Williams the III as the arrogant,
leering "King of Jazz" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano
duel.
The Legend of 1900 was made by Giuseppe Tornatore, whose 1988 Cinema
Paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many. This effort is utterly
limp and lifeless. At once ridiculous, boring, narrow-sighted and
pointless, this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly
forgotten.

Title
Review for Hurricane, The (1999)
 Starring Denzel Washington, John Hannah, Deborah Kara Unger, Liev
Schreiber, Dan Hedaya, Vicellous Reon Shannon. Rated R.
Some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high Oscar
potential that when they're finally released, everyone just goes along
with it. Thus sometimes, films unworthy of any award sans the Razzie
become Oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations. Last year it was
The Thin Red Line. This year's "winner" is The Hurricane, pure
unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with
critical plaudits and votes in the office Oscar pool.
Acclaimed director Norman Jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions
of courtroom movies without any of the fun. And that's supposed to be
ok because, see, it's a true story. It's about Rubin "Hurricane" Carter
(Denzel Washington), a legendary African American prizefighted who is
unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly
(racist!) detective (Dan Hedaya) who's had it in for the "big-shot"
Hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a
knife (in self-defense but who cares, right?) when Rubin was only ten.
He is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole. Most
of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison.
To the rescue -- Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) and his team of
wanna-be detectives. Lesra is an African American teenager taken in by
three well-off Canadian white people (Hanna, Unger, Schreiber) to get
an education. Lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where Lesra picks
out his very first book -- "The Sixteenth Round," Rubin's
autobiography. Immediately thereafter, Schreiber's character tells
Lesra "Sometimes we don't pick the books we read, they pick us." Hmmm.
After a few visits to the prison, they become convinced of Rubin's
innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two
juries have convicted him. They meticulously go through all the files
and revisit all the old witnesses (I wonder if any of them might be
cranky old women who slam the door in their faces?) and in the course
of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence
confirming the Hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never
seeked out during the first two proceedings. Of course, we're already
told that he's innocent.
A movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being
shown everything significant that happened to Carter during this period
in his life. All too obviously, we're getting the Hollywood watered-
down version. That would be ok except that the parts we are getting is
milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could
possibly squeeze out of it. It's almost cruel. The melodrama isn't of
the entertaining kind either; it's the hokey, rammed-down-your-throat
variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity.
Witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial
or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists.
The Hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills
courtroom movie. It's formula stripped to the bare necessities. You
have your wrongly accused black man. You have your melodramatic final
courtroom scene. But there's nothing else. You'd expect some sort of
involving investigation. But that's not necessary since we're
implicitly informed of his innocence. Thus the whole middle portion of
the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding. Brooding to himself.
Brooding to other inmates. Brooding to Lesra. Brooding to Lesra's
Canadian friends. Brooding in letters. I don't think I'll ever look at
brooding the same way again. It wasn't long before I got tired of
hearing the Hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition.
I wanted something to happen.
As for Washington's performance in the title role -- I figured I'd have
to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's
received -- he is top notch, though still boring. How is that possible?
Well, he does what Jewison wanted him to do perfectly. Unfortunately
what Jewison asked him to do is a load of crap. What a waste of a great
performer.
Speaking of wastes, why the hell did John Hannah agree to do this? He's
an extremely talented actor and I love him dearly, but what is he doing
here? To call his character (along with Schreiber's and Unger's) a
stick figure would be a gross understatement. All three of them come
off as veritable Mother Theresas, as benevolent as do-gooders come. If
they're to play a major part in this movie, why not make them real
people, with real feelings and emotions?
Look: if you're going to make a formula movie, don't undermine the
formula. Courtroom dramas can be fun, but this is ridiculous. Not only
is it trite, it's boring.

Title
Review for Mod Squad, The (1999)
I have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series. If
there's a will, there's a way; and I believe that anything, no matter how
great or revered can be effectively improved upon. This is the reason that I
responded so well to Gus Van Sant's universally panned update of Psycho; I
thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience, but also very
on-par with an original. But I do have a big problem with remakes that are
blatantly bad. You see, the point of a remake is, or at least it should be,
to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to
greatness or even perfection. But what if the source material on which the
remake is based isn't any good to begin with?
That is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner The Mod
Squad. I've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which
it is based, and to be honest, I didn't like it all that much. It has a
concept that -- and still is -- interesting; a group of corrupt young
adults, all in their early 20s are given a choice: they either go to jail
for the various crimes that they all have committed, or they can become
undercover cops, helping the police get into places that they normally
wouldn't be able to access. Obviously, all 3 opt for the latter option and
become undercover policemen (and policewomen).
The three main characters here are played by Claire Danes, Omar Epps and
Giovanni Ribisi. Of the three, only Danes has a real character. Ribisi's
dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs; Epps' slightly more
intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes. When the squad's
superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death, the three of
them, sure that their beloved master was framed, go off and investigate on
their own, discovering corrupt cops, lots and lots of expensive whores and
very lucrative drug operations. All kinds of good stuff!
The only times that The Mod Squad comes even close to working is in its
comedic moments. Although Ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat
movie after movie, his man here is really rather amusing, when the script
gives him a chance. Epps' straight man is effectively played against
Ribisi's clueless spontaneity. But the rest of the film is dull, boring and
singularly uninteresting. A drug-op action plot is no longer anything new,
not even with teenage action heroes, and the way it's executed here, it's
also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful.
Claire Danes' character has potential, but it is buried under heaps of
cliches and her performance is too restrained. She could have been a
tour-de-force, but instead director Scott Silver puts shackles on her and
simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role.
Epps and Ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected,
although their characters aren't nearly as rich as Danes' could have been.
The Mod Squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film, and teens will
jump all over it. It's full of bad dialogue, scenes and concepts that make
no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys
in their spare time. Nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for.
Claire Danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible
hairdo, so that draw is out. There are, however, cool explosions, guns and
chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to
experience an exciting thriller of some sort. Do not be fooled. Some may
call this escapist fare -- I call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare.

Title
Review for Sleepless in Seattle (1993)
Starring Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Rosie O'Donnell, Ross Malinger, Bill
Pullman. Rated PG.
I have nothing against unabashedly romantic films. When done right, with
at least slightly evident restraint, they can be engaging, sweeping,
appealing. But it's a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly
as Nora Ephron botched Sleepless in Seattle, a hollow, boring romance
that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers; the ones
willing to buy into Ephron's whiny views of life and romance.
Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, two of Hollywood's most likeable stars play Sam
Baldwin and Annie Reed, repectively. Baldwin's wife recently died and he
moved to Seattle with his son, Jonah, seeking to get away from the
familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse. Jonah senses
tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their
problems. Sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show, but
when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out.
Ephron has him do this so that Annie Reed (Meg Ryan) can hear it. Annie
is a happy woman. She is engaged to Walter, an allergy-prone working man
and seems to be perfectly content. But after hearing Sam the widower on
the radio show, she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is
willing to risk her engagement for it.
Five years after this movie hit theaters, Hanks, Ryan and Ephron would
team up again in the far better, although still sub-par romantic comedy
You've Got Mail, which is about people who hate each other in real life
falling in love on the internet. At least that movie had a sense of
spontaneity. Here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist
solely to set up for the last five. The fact that Sam and Annie will
finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is
perfunctory.
Sleepless in Seattle is full of wonderful performers; from its two leads
to supporting stars like Bill Pullman and Rosie O'Donnell. But none of
them can save the film from being a bore. Its characters are dull and
empty, its script isn't funny or particularly charming. The script has a
fundamental problem: Annie gives up, for little reason, her life with
Walter to pursue "Sleepless in Seattle," whom she has never even seen.
It's the kind of life decision that real people don't make, and its a
major, unforgivable plausibility sacrifice.
In essence, this movie's purpose is to head towards a goal that
shouldn't even exist. It's a ten minute short film with ninety-five
minutes of filler. If you were to show me Sleepless In Seattle and I
didn't have to review it, you could just call me "Asleep in
Philadelphia."

Review for Se7en (1995)
 "Ernest Hemingway once wrote, "The world is a fine place and worth
fighting for." I agree with the second part."
Starring Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey. Rated
R.
*NOTE: This review contains SPOILERS
Four years after its release, some fans and critics are putting David
Fincher's Se7en at the top of their lists for best/scariest movies of
all time. I maintain that its just another serial killer movie, albeit a
well-made one. It's certainly unnerving -- gory and sometimes
frightening -- but it's also fairly standard, even predictable.
Retiring Detective William Somerset (a stone-faced Morgan Freeman) is
given one last assignment: the bizarre murder of a grossly obese man. He
is joined by David Mills (Brad Pitt) an inexperienced, young, obscenity-
sputtering gumshoe who doesn't seem to know how to do anything other
than demand a little respect. After another murder is committed,
Somerset and Mills realize that this killer is murdering people that
exemplify one of the seven deadly sins (namely gluttony, sloth, greed,
lust, envy, wrath or pride).
Seven sins most likely means seven planned murders, so Mills and
Somerset are off to try and stop the perverse killer before he does more
dirty deeds. Inevitably they fail because more gruesome killings are
uncovered, but the killer (a riveting Kevin Spacey) comes to them and
wants to lead them to the final two bodies.
David Fincher (Alien 3, The Game) is impressively adept at building
tension. This is an exciting movie: suspenseful and intense, with
scarcely a hiatus. The way the murders are committed is effectively
shocking (although I couldn't help but think that Fincher staged them
for shock value alone) and the images linger in your mind long after the
movie is over. For pure, unadulterated visceral thrill, there is little
beating Se7en.
But if a movie is only as good as its villain then Se7en is kinda
"blah". Kevin Spacey does his best to make him frightening but never
succeeds in being much more than obnoxious. His "John Doe" is no
Hannibal Lecter and thus the revelation of the killer's identity proves
anticlimactic.
All the acclaim that Se7en has received borders on undeserved. I liked
the movie well enough but I fail to see what people find so
extraordinary about it. It's a solid, suspenseful, exciting thriller
that entertains mightily, but it has no life message nor is it a
particularly meaningful parable about the world we live in. This is one
movie where the best thing to do is watch, rather than think.

Title
Review for Bowfinger (1999)
Starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Christine Baranski,
Adam Alexi-Malle. Rated PG-13.
Steve Martin is one of the most versatile actors in the business; he is
also one of the funniest comics, one of the few capable of making the
viewer believe any situation, no matter how farfetched. That much I knew
before Bowfinger. What I didn't know, and was pleasantly surprised to
learn, is that he is also a marvelous screenwriter. Mind you, this is
not Martin's first stab at scripting his own movie, but with the
possible exception of L.A. Story, it's his first real achievement in the
field (The Man With Two Brains, anyone? No? How 'bout A Simple Twist of
Fate?), a satirical yet good-natured, broad yet riotously funny spoof of
the movie business.
Martin is Bobby Bowfinger, a man with lifelong, so far unrealized dreams
of making a movie, who has kept his actress friend from taking many
promising opportunities with his hopes of making a Hollywood picture.
His accountant buddy writes a script for an action movie, "Chubby Rain".
Bowfinger brings the script to a big shot Hollywood producer. The
producer likes it and agrees to sponsor and release the movie under one
condition: Bowfinger must get Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy), the biggest
action star around, to sign up for the project.
Ramsey says no but Bowfinger is not ready to give up on his lifelong
dream so easily. He decides to make the movie with Ramsey anyway:
without him knowing it. The problem is that Bowfinger's own performers
(a young, ambitious, sleazy wanna-be actress (Heather Graham) and a
self-proclaimed thespian (Christine Baranski)) both believe that they
are actually acting with Kit as opposed to coming up to him on the
street (in the parking lot, at a restaraunt, etc.), shouting lines and
having him run away in fear and confusion. Bowfinger tells them that
Ramsey's acting style dictates that he never socially interact with his
co-stars.
Sooner than later, a frightened Kit Ramsey starts hiding out and Bobby
must find an alternative method of starring the coveted actor in "Chubby
Rain". He holds auditions for Kit look-alikes (a requirement: a nice
ass, because Kit Ramsey, much like real-life Ewan McGregor, has a
running streak of showing his derrier on screen) and finds a near-twin.
Jiff (Murphy again) is exactly like Kit in everyway save the braces, the
stupid laugh and outgoing personality.
Bowfinger may not be the best satire of Hollywood ever but it's up there
with gems like The Player. It's also one of the best films of 1999.
Steve Martin's writing is sharp, witty and dead-on. Bowfinger, as a
whole, is a very, very funny movie but even during the the times when
the jokes take a break it's still entertaining because unlike a lot of
otherwise funny comedies it has a legitimate plot and characters we can
care about. Not even Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me could claim
that.
There is not a trace of anger in Bowfinger despite the fact that it is
rightfully classified as a satire. It exaggerates and it makes fun but
it's never mean or mocking. In fact, if I was asked for one word to most
aptly describe Bowfinger my answer would be "affectionate". Much like
the Austin Powers movies, here is a spoof that has no animosity towards
its subject. And that can make for good viewing.
In addition to his glorious script, Steve Martin's performance is
likewise on the ball; frantic, energetic, appealing and hilarious. He
put thought and love into his acting here and it shows: his Bobby
Bowfinger is one of the most likable -- and human -- screen characters I
have seen in a Hollywood movie. As for his similarly big-name co-star,
for the first time in years and possibly for the first time since he
became popular, Eddie Murphy contents himself with a supporting
performance. Indeed, he has only about half of the screentime that
Martin was allotted. Still, Murphy makes his presence felt. For the time
that he is on screen, he is as funny as ever. Eddie Murphy may be taking
the back seat on this one but damned if he isn't a good back seat
driver.
Bowfinger is entertaining, smart and unpretentious. It never claims to
be a meditation on the state of the film business but it is an effective
satire; a good-natured, funny and enjoyable combination of wildly
talented comics and a killer script.

Title
Review for Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)
Starring Angelina Jolie, Noah Taylor, Iain Glen,
Daniel Craig, Chris Barrie, John Voight. Directed by
Simon West. Rated PG-13.
The official title of this long-awaited video game
adaptation is Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Just like that.
No punctuation, not even a comma or a colon. It's a
bad omen; fortunately, it's just about the only
sloppiness you'll see in this sleek, almost
embarassingly entertaining summer blockbuster. The
critics ripped the movie apart, but it's a great
time-waster, perfect for taking in casually on a
Saturday afternoon and forgetting an hour later. And
I'm a sucker for completely gratuitous shower scenes,
especially if the showeree is the likes of Angelina
Jolie. Sue me.
The plot is nonsense about a fight for 2 pieces of
some mysterious talisman that, at the appropriate
planetary alignment that only occurs every 5000 years
or so, will give its possessor the power to change the
fabric of space and time. Or something like that. Lara
Croft, a famous Tomb Raider (the movie never defines
exactly what a "Tomb Raider" is), is saddled with the
task of stopping the Illuminati, a secret organization
of shady old men, from obtaining the parts of the
triangle. Her opponent: the suave, evil, Manfred
Powell (Iain Glenn), who is committed to giving the
Illuminati what they want. Working with Powell is Alex
West (Daniel Craig), also a Tomb Raider and,
apparently, Lara's former love interest.
This is silly, of course, but you can follow it --
which is much more than can be said for the
inexplicably better-reviewed Swordfish -- and all
that's left to do after that is watch Jolie fire
multiple guns at a time at weird robot-like creatures.
The subject matter here is mythical mumbo-jumbo, but
director Simon West (Con Air) makes an interesting
decision: instead of approaching it with the childlike
awe of The Mummy, he treats it with a sort of
ultra-hip indifference. Jolie has a constant smirk on
her face and so, it seems, does the director; the
movie doesn't make fun of the plot or acknowledge its
prepostrousness, but it sort of dismisses its own
story as just another day in the life of Lara Croft.
The action sequences are fluid and exciting, and the
special effects don't call attention to themselves.
I'm not a big fan of the climax, which is a bit too
goofy even for my tastes, but everything that precedes
it is good fun. To risk overreaching, Jolie may be the
best action heroine I've ever seen; she's confident
and comfortable with the material, either overcoming
or just plain ignoring the bombshell status placed on
her. She doesn't have much dialogue and she doesn't
need any; the movie avoids making an embarassment of
itself by keeping it to a minimum.
There's a subplot involving Lara Croft's father
(played by Jolie's real father, Jon Voight) that works
to provide motivation for a crucial decision Croft
makes in the climax. None of it is meant to be taken
seriously, of course, and there's no pathos to speak
of, but it's good to see the history of the character
mentioned (Mummy's Rick O'Connell seems to have popped
out of nowhere).
In a summer when a surprising amount of big-budget
movies are just plain clunky, Tomb Raider is
well-made, confident and entertaining
through-and-through. People have harangued it for
being pointless, but what's the point of such an
argument against a movie like this? 

Title
Review for Final Destination (2000)
Starring Devon Sawa, Kristen Cloke, Amanda Detmer, Chad Donella,
Brendan Fehr, Seann William Scott. Directed by James Wong. Rated R.
Final Destination, the latest from the teen horror genre, gets off to a
strong start and plummets downhill from there. It was written and
directed by X-Files veterans, but they choose to abandon what they do
best and pander to the lowest-common-denominator audience. By the time
the action reached its climax and all hell broke loose, I felt like I
was watching a group of obviously talented writers defeated by the
system. I've read that the original draft actually had the Grim Reaper
chasing the characters with his scythe. Perhaps that would have been a
bit more original -- not to mention funnier.
The movie starts off with a creepy titles sequence that has something
to do with fans and then cuts to Alex (Devon Sawa), a high school
student getting ready for his senior trip to France. He's a slightly
superstitious kid and he's been having bad feelings about this trip for
a while now. Creepy omens, premonitions, things like that. This
doomsday state peaks when Alex actually gets on the plane. As he
settles in his seat, he sees a disaster happen; first the plane shakes,
then it explodes. He panics, causing himself, 5 other students and a
teacher to be kicked off the aircraft. Minutes later, as the flight
takes off, they hear a crash and the airport window breaks violently.
The plane exploded and killed all onboard.
Understandably, this elicits tumultuous feelings from the 7 people who
got off the doomed flight 180. Most consider Alex to be a spook,
considering the unnerving way in which he predicted the disaster. The
FBI suspects him. The teacher he presumably saved reviles him. But then
things take a turn for the weird. The 7 people that lived start dying,
one by one. It seems that Alex's premonition wasn't part of Death's
plan and Death still wants them. But there is no Grim Reaper here;
Death comes in the form of bizarre accidents and coincidences.
There are some effectively creepy scenes in Final Destination's first
half hour. The plane sequence manages to evoke some actual jumps and
the first death is genuinely scary because it's not as overblown as
most of the ones that come later. Of course people will be talking
about the "bus scene," on which I won't elaborate beyond saying that it
evoked memories of a certain scene in Meet Joe Black.
Unfortunately, the movie can't keep it up. Once we pass the halfway
point, Final Destination starts to get more ludicrous, more standard-
issue with every minute of its running time. The climax is absurdly
self-important, with a lot of explosions, fire, et al. There is not a
touch of awareness that this has all been done before -- and better.
And the movie doesn't even have the guts to resist inserting that
obligatory final scare that we've all come to expect from horror
movies. It's always passed off as a big surprise, but is it that
surprising if it's present in nearly every film of the genre?
The performances are mostly unremarkable. Devon Sawa is merely ok as
the hero and Kristen Cloke is irritatingly snobbish as the teacher who
turns against Alex (it's almost fun to watch her get her comeuppance,
even though that probably wasn't the intention). Only Amanda Detmer, as
Alex's newfound buddy, gives a performance quirky enough to be unique.
Can these frighteningly good-looking teenagers cheat death and come out
alive? It's a plot brimming with potential but dependent on good
execution. Final Destination relies too much on mayhem and too little
on suspense to be an effective thriller, teen or otherwise. Someone's
going to get fired for this. I can feel it.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
"I will sell this house today."
Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Chris
Cooper. Rated R.
In my reviews I try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you
what to see or what not to see. I realize that we all have different tastes
and I cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike.
But in the case of American Beauty, I must make an exception. If you haven't
yet seen it, go see it. Now. Stop reading this review and head for your
local multiplex, then after you've seen it, come back. I'll wait here.
Welcome Back. If you followed my advice (and I see no reason why you should
not have, do you?), I'm sure you've just had one of the richest cinematic
experiences of your life. American Beauty is an extraordinary film, a
powerful, jolting exploration of the dark side of the American dream. It's
humorous but it isn't funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent
that runs throughout the whole production. Mixing comedy and the darkest of
drama was the way this film was intended, and by God, it works, making it
one of the year's very best.
Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises.
He is living life without a purpose. He is bored, depressed and sick of his
sheltered, insignificant existence. He barely ever talks to his family, has
no sex life, is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live.
But one day, when he and his equally troubled wife (Annette Bening) attend
one of his daughter's (Thora Birch) cheerleading performances, he sees
something that makes him come alive. What he sees is the performance by his
daughter's friend, the head cheerleader. He develops a lust for the
promiscuous young girl; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in
nature. But for the first time, Lester feels that he is actually living.
This crush is only the beginning. Lester proceeds to make more and more
radical changes in his life, buying the car of his dreams, cursing off the
boss and quitting his job ("Today I quit my job, told the boss to f***
himself and blackmailed him for $60,000 -- would you pass the asparagus
please?"), buying drugs from the voyeur-next-door (Ricky Fitts, a teenager
who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be "beauty") and refusing
to be docile in family affairs. His new attitude further alienates his
daughter, only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks
of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be, and inspiring her to
enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor.
And the Burnhams's neighbors provide American Beauty with a significant
chunk of its dramatic momentum. Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) serves as the
film's thematic center, providing the obscure, powerful meaning of the
title. Colonel Fitts, the father, is one of the most fascinating and complex
characters in the movie, even considering his limited screentime.
Kevin Spacey has never been better, and this performance will certainly earn
him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel. He never plays his
droll character as a freak, rather, he effectively portrays him as a normal
person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life.
Spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime. Equally
astonishing is young Thora Birch, who plays her potentially stereotypical
rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness.
At two hours and ten minutes, American Beauty didn't feel nearly long
enough. It's a complicated, unforgettable film that, like The Ice Storm two
years ago, dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life. Powerfully
and cynically, it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white
picket fence and appealing garden being the American Dream. It claims that
this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image, and hiding behind it
are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it.
The dark, deeply ironic ending, though given away by our narrator in the
first few minutes of the movie, stays with you for weeks after it's all
over. American Beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film Hollywood
needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see
released; even more so considering it's a masterpiece.

Title
Review for Music of the Heart (1999)
"How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice, practice, practice."
Starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett, Gloria Estefan.
Rated PG.
There are two parts to Music of the Heart. One is a charming, well-
developed, engrossing human story. The other is a derivative, formulaic
piece of pseudo-inspirational melodrama. Priority is given to the
latter. Meryl Streep does her best with it, but fails to lift it above
mediocrity; the general storyline is too tired and too overdone to work
with any actor or actress. This is a good effort from genre-hopping
director Wes Craven, but it never does come around.
They say it's a true story: struggling musician Roberta Gaspari comes
to East Harlem with her two kids to teach. Though she is met with
fierce opposition, she manages to start a violin class in a local
elementary school. She is treated with skepticism by the principal
(Angela Bassett) and with utter contempt by the head of the music
department. Determined as anything, she persists and succeeds in
establishing an enormously successful program that is eventually taken
beyond the elementary school and into the high school.
Meanwhile her husband and father of her two boys has left her for a
former friend and she starts up a relationship with the charming Brian
(Aidan Quinn), whom the boys take to well. Unfortunately it falls apart
when Brian tells Roberta that he does not believe in the institution of
marriage and if Roberta didn't meet all of his need he would, in
theory, seek to have his needs met elsewhere. After that fling comes to
a screeching halt, Roberta spends years as a single mother, until her
fed up sons, now all grown up, place a personal ad in the newspaper on
her behalf (but without her permission).
Her life is torn apart when, predictably, the school board cuts the
budget and the violin program is cut. Her position is put in jeopardy.
She decides to give the system a fight for their money. With the help
of her friend, Roberta plans a benefit concert at a local theater,
starring her most advanced violinists as well as a couple world-famous
violin stars. Hell, she even brings back 3 of her first students, now
dashing young ladies and gentlemen who still happen to remember how to
impeccably play a difficult instrument.
Music of the Heart manages to go through every solitary convention
usually associated with these kinds of films. There's the idealistic
teacher whom nobody believes in but who triumphs at the end; the evil
schoolboard that conveniently slashes the budget; the mother of a
student who confronts the teacher, telling her that what she is
teaching is worthless ("white man's music," in this case); and of
course the big standing ovation at the end. It is a retread of a whole
bunch of movies: Dangerous Minds, Mr. Holland's Opus, Lean on Me, even
Sister Act. It's even less compelling.
I did like the personal story, which is far too shortened and concise.
The result of the personal ad was wrapped up so abruptly it seemed like
a script screw-up; I wanted to see more. Roberta Gaspari is a rich,
interesting character stuck in a horrid plot punctuated by occasional
heartfelt moments. The film's focus is on the wrong part of the plot;
the human story would have served as a far better vehicle for thespian
extraordinaire Streep.
The film was directed, oddly enough, by none other than Wes Craven, the
horror-meister who brought us A Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream. I
suppose he molds to the genre well, with only the slightest hints of
his horror movie roots (such as a scene where Streep, upon finding out
some bad news, walks menacingly down a hallway, her head low, her hair
flowing, with intense music blaring on the soundtrack) left over. I
appreciate the effort to break out of his niche genre, but this was the
wrong project to do so; his Scream movies were much less ordinary and
formulaic.
The film insists on telling us that it's a true story, almost as a
justification for its trite plot. When I pan a film that was "based on
a true story" on the grounds of an inadequate plot, people always tell
me "That really happened: the filmmakers didn't make it up!" Well I
don't care. Not every true story has to be made into a movie. This
particular story has been filmed too many times, both fictitiously and
allegedly based on facts. Enough already.

Title
Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
"Can a woman trust you?"
"As long as her interests don't run too contrary to my own."
Starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary. Rated R.
The Thomas Crown Affair is a film so well-made technically that it lures
you into thinking that it's actually good cinematically. It's not. But
the movie moves so smoothly that we almost don't notice the fact that it
expects us to believe things that are impossible -- not just implausible
-- impossible. Ridiculous performances and the masqueraded shallowness
of the center relationship might also fly by the less discriminating
viewer. It's like a lemon automobile with a shiny coat of paint.
Besides making the classic actioner Die Hard, director John McTiernan is
also responsible for Last Action Hero, one of the biggest flops in
history. This is his second movie since that humiliating occasion and
even if it isn't very good, he certainly redeems himself as a director
(working on an assumption that he ever needed redemption, which quite
arguable).
In a James Bond-ish performance (surprised?), Pierce Brosnan plays
Thomas Crown, a limitlessly wealthy "finance geek", as one of the
characters naively puts it, to whom there is more than meets the eye.
He's thrill-seeker extraordinaire and a world-class thief; a man to whom
the process of stealing a difficult-to-snatch object is worth infinitely
more than actually possessing it. When he illicitly gets ahold of a
Monet original worth $100 million he gets more than he bargained for:
Catherine Banning (Rene Russo), a clever insurance agent responsible for
retrieving the painting if she can.
Crown loves a good challenge so he indirectly admits to her that it was
he who took the beloved Monet and gets her to date him (why? how?). They
sleep together (hello?) and fall in love (why? how? when?) and that puts
dear Catherine into a dilemma: does she run away with Crown or does she
turn him in?
Aside from the numerous logical contradictions, especially associated
with the admittedly clever climax, the first major flaw that struck me
was the supported notion that Thomas Crown can correctly guess what
everyone around him is going to do. McTiernan's intention seems to be to
define him as an enigma: but this is a full-fledged romance and such
definition is wholly inappropriate. As such, Crown rarely feels human to
us and thus doesn't seem capable of falling in love. If the filmmakers
wanted the romance to work they should have made Thomas Crown a real
person.
Rene Russo's laughable performance doesn't help the situation any.
Constantly leering, comically self-confident, her character suffers from
a similar ailment as Brosnan's except in her case it's the performer's
fault. She's more of a femme fatale than a human being; a superhero
rather than a woman (Inspector Gadget could have used her presence).
Rene Russo is another factor that keeps the romance from ever going
anywhere. It has a fancy coating but it remains shallow and impersonal;
we see two people falling in love but get no insight into their
relationship.
Despite all of the above, The Thomas Crown Affair remains a moderately
entertaining, engaging movie. It's very well-directed and wonderfully
filmed. It also benefits from what is probably the year's best score:
intricate and beautiful, it not only adds excitement to scenes that very
much need it but it also pulls off the feat of flawlessly and
unintrusively supplementing the action even in scenes where suspense,
which a film's score is predominantly and sometimes exclusively used to
emphasize, takes the back seat to another prevalent emotion.
I can't recommend The Thomas Crown Affair, but I can't say I strongly
disliked it either. It's a film by someone who knows how to make films
and does it well. Unfortunately it's deeply flawed (although the flaws
don't come to you until after the movie) and I can't, with a clear
conscience suggest that you see it over some of the far better movies
this summer. But if your debating whether to see, say, Inspector Gadget
or The Thomas Crown Affair, leap for those Thomas tickets or be sorry.

Review for Rules of Engagement (2000)
Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Guy Pearce, Bruce
Greenwood, Ben Kingsley. Directed by William Friedkin. Rated R.
I'm not the first to say this, but Rules of Engagement is a real
testament to the skills of three great actors. The movie itself is
utterly hollow, a confused diatribe unable or unwilling to determine
what exactly its convictions are. I've heard that the reason for this
is the film's commercialization for easy access by a wide audience and
for once, it may have been for the best. As it stands, I would have
probably enjoyed the film far less had it been a moral lesson rather
than just an entertaining popcorn flick.
The movie begins in the jungles of Vietnam, where Colonels Terry
Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) are
under a surprise guerrilla attack by North Vietnamese soldiers. Hodges
is shot. A desperate Childers executes a Vietnamese soldier in an
effort to make the general tell his troops to back off. He then drages
Hodges to safety. This scene is there to set up the fact that Hodges is
indebted to Childers -- something that will become important later on.
Years pass. Hayes Hodges is now a small-time military lawyer about to
retire; Childers is still an active Colonel. One day, he is sent to the
American embassy in Yemen, where native protesters have surrounded the
building with the ambassador (Ben Kingsley) inside and are getting
rowdy. In essense, this is a babysitting mission: go in, get the
ambassador out, leave. But things get more complicated than that. It
seems there are snipers set up in strategic locations around the
building and the crowd also seems to have weapons. Childers' marines
start to get shot. Panicking, Childers orders his men to fire into the
crowd, yelling "Waste the motherfuckers." 73 Yemenese civilians die;
over a hundred are injured.
Back at home, the head honchos of the military are scared to death of a
scandal. The National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood) decides to
avoid fingers pointed at the American military by blaming the whole
thing on Col. Childers. He destroys the tape that proves that the crowd
in front of the embassy did indeed have weapons. Childers is court
marshaled and charged with murder. He asks his old friend Hayes to
defend him. At first, Hayes is reluctant ("I'm a good enough lawyer to
know that you need a better lawyer than me.") but finally gives in
because of his debt to his friend. Meanwhile, Major Mark Biggs (Guy
Pearce), a big-shot, Stanford-educated lawyer, volunteers to prosecute.
Rules of Engagement is one of the more engrossing military dramas that
I've seen. It was directed by William Friedkin (The Exorcist), who has
a flair for undistinctive, unpretentious but always effective
camerawork. He uses camera tricks but he doesn't over use them (ahem,
Oliver Stone) and the result is a movie that flows smoothly, grabbing
your attention from point one and never letting go.
Friedkin really has his stars to thank for that. Jackson is excellent,
despite having the most bombastic and least versatile of the roles in
the movie. Even in his character's most defeated state, he still exudes
authority. Jones has opportunities for poignancy, action and even
laughs. Despite being typecast nowadays, he's still a consistently
entertaining actor -- and as a lawyer, he's unbeatable. I also liked
what Guy Pearce did with the thankless role of the prosecuting
attorney. He's a villain in the story, yes, but Pearce makes him a
little more than that: a ruthless man with a little sympathy running
underneath.
It should be said that Rules of Engagement has absolutely no message.
It doesn't know what it wants to say, or even if it wants to say
anything. It takes a point of view: Col. Childers should not be
punished because the crowd had weapons and he was defending his men.
And then it begins to thematically eat itself by starting to make
arguments for the other side. It goes back and forth that way until we
abandon all hope of the film actually being significant and focus on
the glorious performances and the smart, concise, enjoyable dialogue.
The courtroom scenes, at least, have the force of conviction.
When push comes to shove, Rules of Engagement comes through as a
mindless courtroom melodrama and inevitably fails on the rare occasions
when it tries to pass itself off as something more than that. It's not
brain food, but no one will be bored.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
Starring Hugh Grant, Julia Roberts, Rhys Ifans. Rated PG-13.
Notting Hill is a movie that plays off a dream. It's a dream many people
have. Imagine, if you will, this scenario: you get a knock on your door
one afternoon. You go to open it, and on your doorstep you see one of
the most famous movie stars in the world, someone you have seen time and
again, someone you admire, perhaps even adore (don't even ask why they
are there, stick with me here). What would you do? What would you say?
How would you conduct yourself? It's quite an interesting thought,
really. One often imagines something like that happening to him, but if
push comes to shove and it actually happens, he is dumbfounded. And what
if that movie star, presumably of the opposite sex, comes up and plants
a big wet kiss on you? That's what Notting Hill is about.
Hugh Grant, whose talents have taken second billing to the 1995 scandal
when he reportedly hired a prostitute to perform undignified sexual acts
on him in the privacy of his car, is actually a damn good actor. He's
got a boyish, often befuddled charm that can only be described as crowd-
pleasing, but it's also effective. Here, he stars as William Thacker, a
struggling travel bookshop owner in a section of London called Notting
Hill. When Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a female movie star the
equivalent of, well, Julia Roberts, walks into his bookshop one day, he
is understandably amazed but he maintains his composure (even if he does
give her a free book). He remains human even when later that same day he
bumps into Anna on the street and spills some coffee on her. He
excitedly invites her to go clean up at his place, across the street (18
yards away), to clean up. That is where the big wet kiss is planted.
Before long, it's full-fledged love affair, with Anna coming to
William's sister's birthday (complete with exclamations of "Holy F*ck!"
by astounded family members), them climbing over garden walls, and so
on. It's an extraordinarily engaging affair, mainly because Thacker's I-
can't-believe-this-is-happening astonishment is so palpable. For once,
here is the old "ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances" plot, when
the extraordinary circumstances are actually positive, as is this
relentlessly upbeat, optimistic modern fairly tale.
Notting Hill asks whether fame is a goal or an obstacle; whether one who
is a household name can achieve the happiness that so many "ordinary
people" can arrive at. It is an exhilirating, funny, profound film, full
of smart, realistic dialogue, masterful cinematography and magical
acting. Julia Roberts, whose last romantic comedy was the equally
wonderful My Best Friend's Wedding, is terrific; although
understandably, the role isn't much of a stretch for her, she has the
ailing superstar feel down cold. Hugh Grant is something else again --
the bumbling Brit is an absolute delight, and the scene where he
impersonates a reporter from "Horse and Hound" magazine is a triumph of
understated comedy.
Director Roger Michell, whose only other major motion picture was the
Jane Austen adaptation Persuasion, stages this movie free of any
suspense or particularly pressing conflict; it's a whimsical, airy
production that is part crowd-pleaing and part profound and thoughtful.
Even though William's degenerate roommate (Rhys Ifans) is a bit too
much, the comedy rarely gets in the way of the plot, nor does it spoil
the movie's mood.
This is a perfect example of how good "mainstream" movies can be. It's
hard to remember the last time a romantic comedy worked this well, this
consistently. Grant and Roberts are awesome, in a movie that pulls no
punches and plays no tricks. It would be cliched and disrespectful to
call Notting Hill the "feel-good movie of the year," but that's what it
is; an upbeat, optimistic story of how an ordinary bloke and a superstar
fell in love. Happens every day.

Review for Out-of-Towners, The (1999)
The Out-of-Towners (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/outoftowners.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, John Cleese. Rated PG-13.
A sitcom is neatly defined as a situation comedy, which means that we laugh
at the situations that the characters get themselves into and, perhaps, how
they get themselves out of the situation, but that is all. The
Out-of-Towners, then, is nothing more than a sitcom. This is actually a
remake of a 1970 Neil Simon comedy, and that film, starring Jack Lemmon was
appropriate and entertaining (and even appropriately entertaining).
Unfortunately director Sam Weisman and screenwriter Marc Lawrence decide to
go for less laughs and more sex in their inadvisable retread. Thankfully The
Out-of-Towners stars two people who are very capable of rising above their
screenplays, those being Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. They play a husband
and wife who come to New York from Ohio for said husband's job interview and
have everything go wrong that possibly can. Let's see... their plane gets
diverted, they get on the wrong train, their luxury sedan starts speaking
French, they nearly fall off a hotel marquee (don't stop, just keep reading),
their credit card is maxed out... I won't ruin the experience for you by
mentioning all of the many other things that happen to this poor couple, but
you get the idea.
Not only that, but The Out-of Towners also decides, for motives that remain
unclear to me to this point, to be a study of a marriage in crisis (something
the original wasn't). That certainly provides for more than a few moments of
"Aaaaaaw" sweetness but it intercuts more moments of "Eeeeew" schmaltz.
Either way, whether its filmmakers realize this or not, The Out-of-Towners
was written directly for the small screen. The screenplay screams sitcom
because it gets its characters into a compromising situation (such as being
the unwitting participants of a Sexaholics meeting) and simply says "Funny,
no?" In a half- hour tv show this is ok. From a movie we expect more. Last
year the Farrelly brothers surprised us all by always taking their gags a
step further than we would expect. Doing that in The Out-of-Towners would
have made the film a gem.
I would be lying if I said that I did not find at least some of the film
amusing; in fact I thought that some moments were indeed quite funny. When we
see the hotel manager dancing in drag, even though it's not quite as
"Omigod!" shocking in these '90s, we laugh, mostly thanks to John Cleese whom
we will get to in just a moment. Likewise the scene where Hawn's character
gets the bright idea to seduce a single traveler in order to get into his
hotel room and have dinner is damn near hysterical. But there are many more
moments that feel hopelessly contrived, like the aforementioned scene in
which our ill-fated couple is forced to escape from a hotel by climbing down
the hotel marquee. Hello? We are in the middle of New York and two weirdos
are hanging 100 feet up in the air making a hotel sign hang lopsided. No one
screams? No one points getting the attention of hotel employees? And anyway,
what idiot would climb down a hotel sign when he or she wants to get away
without attracting attention in the first place?
Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are both experienced comedians, and it is well
within the bounds of their abilities to take these things and make them
funny. For many of them they do just that. But there is only so far two
actors, no matter how good, can take a screenplay that is nearly devoid of
creativity. This rule, of course, excludes performers as divinely good as,
say, John Cleese who literally saves this movie from oblivion. As the hotel
manager with weird tendencies he is a squealing delight, the one highlight in
a dull production.
Rent the original Out-of-Towners instead. Trust me on this. The remake, star-
studded as it may be, is glaringly sub-par, a reminder that nothing but John
Cleese can rescue from embarassment a movie with a screenplay this pathetic.

Review for Violon rouge, Le (1998)
 Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Don McKellar, Carlo Cecchi, Irene Grazioli,
Jean-Luc Bideau, Christopher Koncz, Jason Flemyng, Greta Scacci, Sylvia
Chang, Liu Zifang, Colm Feore. Not Rated.
Perfection is elusive. In fact, many will argue that nothing on Earth
has ever truly achieved it. Some will even say that there really is no
such thing as perfection because everything has flaws; be they concrete
or abstract, large or minute. The Red Violin, a stellar new movie from
Canadian director François Girard, explores the concept of perfection
and what it takes to achieve it.
One of the first scenes in the film takes place at a very prestigious
auction. As we enter, the auction is drawing to a close with what is the
last lot of the evening, an instrument introduced as "The Red Violin."
The camera lingers on the gorgeous piece as we are transported back 3
centuries, to the time and place of the violin's creation.
So begins the story of this uniquely powerful instrument. It's told in
an offbeat manner via a fortune teller reading into the future of the
violin creator's wife through tarot cards. This is deceptive because she
is telling the future of the violin rather than of the woman, who is to
die during childbirth soon after. The kicker, however, is that the
violin was painted red by her husband using a brush made from his
deceased wife's hair and paint colored by the red of her blood. Made
with love and out of love, the violin becomes a character in the movie;
analogous with the violin maker's wife.
The Red Violin tracks the history of its subject as it changes hands and
travels the world, introducing us to many a fascinating character along
the way. We come back to the auction scene on numerous occasions, as the
movie slowly reveals the motives of the characters we see in present day
(one of whom is played by Samuel L. Jackson). Girard is master of his
domain -- time -- to the point where his film flows freely through it
every which way, manipulating it at will while maintaining the narrative
cohesion necessary for the film to work as a story.
As The Red Violin progressed, the violin -- an inanimate object --
established a veritable personality of its own, a feat only the most
deft of directors can achieve. This instrument, which drastically and
almost consciously changed the lives of everyone it touched, is
established as something perfect from the start: a masterpiece. It is
shot at, buried, mutilated and subjected to numerous trials and
tribulations and yet it always survives: inevitable for a completely
flawless entity.
Making a film like this is dangerous because it has the potential to
become a pretentious bore (give the project to Terrence Malick or John
Sayles and voila!). There is enough theme here to make this a self-
indulgently abstract, philosophizing movie, sticking in voiceover
narrations and adding excess symbolism. François Girard, however, keeps
this movie cerebral yet down-to-earth. He also proves that a movie about
a 300 year old violin can be mesmerizing: I did not suspect that this
film might be capable of genuinely entertaining me, but alas I'm happy
to report that aside from making think, The Red Violin engaged me and
kept my eyes glued to the screen.
The story and concept of the violin is intriguing and scintillating, but
what is most impressive about this movie is how each of the many
characters is interesting as well. From the passionate dedication of
George Poussin to teaching his prodigy to Frederick Pope's bizarre
connection between sex and music, each of the people in The Red Violin
is worth exploring and analyzing. This is an added bonus to what is
already a gloriously multifaceted film.
It is films like The Red Violin that keep me coming back to the movie
theaters week after week, day after day. It works at an astounding
number of levels, entertaining casual moviegoers with its plot twists
and its suspense, impressing classical music lovers with a powerful and
poignant score, all the while engaging cineasts with its thematic
intricacies. It could very well be that nothing in the real world can
achieve perfection, but The Red Violin is as close as films come.

Title
Review for Mumford (1999)
"Kind of impatient for a big-time head shrinker, aren't you. How about
you let me explain it my way, ok? Thanks, that'd be great."
Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee, Alfre Woodard, Martin Short,
David Paymer, Ted Danson. Rated R.
The great thing about Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune is that aside
from being entertainingly quirky, it was warmhearted, sunny and subtly
emotional. What mires down the similarly eccentric Lawrence Kasdan
comedy Mumford is that it isn't any of those things. It remains
emotionally distant and oddly impersonal; its protagonist's true
feelings a mystery to the audience. We laugh, we're entertained, but we
can't get involved. We're simply denied access.
Mumford is about Dr. Mumford from the town of Mumford. Dr. Mumford
(Loren Dean) is a psychologist who has only been in town a couple weeks
and he already has more patients then the other two area head doctors
combined. So talented is he that he is approached by the town's most
affluent citizen, Skip Skipperton. You see, Skip is a computer whiz and
owner of "Panda Modem", a company which employs most everyone who lives
in Mumford. Skip is lonely and wants the doctor's help, but wants it
discreetly. He is afraid that his company's stock may tumble if people
find out he is visiting a psychologist. He wants Dr. Mumford to treat
him without anyone finding out.
If you have not been exposed to this movie's advertising campaign and do
not want to know its "secret" which is revealed in all the trailers,
read no further.
Dr. Mumford gets to like Skip Skipperton, who reveals all of his secrets
to him. So he tells Skip a secret of his own. He is not, "nor has [he]
ever been" a psychologist. How he has managed to keep his lack of
credentials a secret baffles Skip, who insists that while Doc Mumford
may not be a psychologist, he's good at it. His other patients may or
may not agree. Seeing as he treats nearly everyone in the town, the rest
of his clientele, whom we get to know fairly intimately is an eccentric
group indeed. The head cases include: Nessa, a angst-ridden teenager
pissed off about everything that it is possible to get pissed off about
and then some; Henry, a troubled pharmacist obsessed with his film-noir
style sexual fantasies which he doesn't deem himself worthy of starring
in; and finally Sophie, a woman allegedly afflicted with Chronic Fatigue
Disorder, and a woman Dr. Mumford winds up falling in love with.
None of these people have any idea that their trusted psychologist is a
fake (why he is pretending to be a P.h.D. I will not reveal), and they
go on confiding in him. He is good at what he does: he's a terrific
listener and a perceptive person. But nevertheless he is not a doctor,
and it isn't long before he is hounded by the certification board.
We are allowed to get to know Dr. Mumford's patients almost
uncomfortably well. They are surprisingly interesting people: complex
and often touchingly troubled. That's all well and good, but what about
our main character? Don't we need to get to know him? Writer-director
Lawrence Kasdan (The Big Chill) keeps Dr. Mumford strangely isolated
from the audience. We never have the privilege of being involved in his
feelings, his thoughts, his motives. When the love story subplot rolls
around, we have a hard time accepting it because we don't know what's
driving Mumford. We scarcely get any clues about the man's nature. The
situation is hardly helped by Loren Dean's performance; he underplays
his role to the point where he looks like he is reciting his lines off a
teleprompter.
There's something else plaguing Mumford; a flaw that bugged me only in
retrospect: it is a naggingly unprogressive movie. Common sense dictates
that a storyline should, in some way, progress from point A to point B.
Wierder films may have it backwards or may be jumping all over the
place, but its protagonists change, as do the people around them.
Mumford starts at point A and never really goes anywhere. As I walked
out of the theater, I thought about what I saw and realized that the
only elements that changed were the Doc's patients. But was the film
about them? Our primary focus, Dr. Mumford remains stoic and closed off;
worse, we are led to believe that the events of the movie have had no
effect on the man.
I was never bored watching Mumford; it was just quirky enough and just
amusing enough to hold my attention for 96 minutes. But I was never
engaged in the film's story nor did I care about its main character.
I've seen far worse dramedies than this one, but for the accomplished
Kasdan, it isn't particularly impressive. Oh, and by the way, if you met
a man who spends all his free time making robot sextoys, what would you
do?

Title
Review for Hearts in Atlantis (2001)
Starring Anton Yelchin, Anthony Hopkins, Hope Davis.
Directed by Scott Hicks. Rated PG-13.
Film adaptations of Stephen King novels are
notoriously uneven. For every Green Mile and Carrie,
there's a Thinner and a Children of the Corn. Despite
the dubious track record, Hearts in Atlantis seemed
like it couldn't lose. The film, based on a) a
critically acclaimed b) coming-of-age-tale with c) no
elements of horror, would star d) Anthony Hopkins and
be directed by e) Scott "Shine" Hicks. If all else
fails, the resulting effort would at least have to be
interesting.
Turns out that the movie is a great deal more than
merely interesting. It's a wonderful, nostalgic piece,
closest in mood and spirit of another great Stephen
King movie: Stand By Me. Bobby Garfield (Anton
Yelchin) is an average pre-teen growing up in the
1960's. His father didn't leave them a penny when he
left, as his bitter, self-absorbed mother Elizabeth
(Hope Davis) doesn't fail to remind him every chance
she gets. A boarder moves into the upstairs apartment,
a kindly, slightly eccentric gentleman named Ted
Brautigan (Anthony Hopkins).
Brautigan offers to pay Bobby a dollar a week to read
the daily paper to him and, despite the warnings and
suspicions of his mother, soon becomes a friend and a
mentor. He's no child molester, but there's something
strange about him all the same. He tells Bobby to look
out for "low men" in the "Dickensian sense;" crooks
who want something from him and will circle their prey
like hyenas before moving in for the kill. Once in a
while, he goes into a trance and wakes up with a yell.
And how does he know all those things about everyone
around him, anyway?
There is a supernatural element to the story, yes, but
it is little more than a backdrop, a red herring for
the simply elegant coming-of-age story that is the
film's real concern. It is no accident that the "low
men" are never anything but ciphers, and there are no
dramatic showdowns with people hanging off catwalks by
their fingernails. There is, however, a boy: a real
boy, intelligent and not at all whiny, who, we
suspect, will never be the same again.
It is a redundancy to say that Anthony Hopkins gives
an Oscar-caliber performance, since every one of his
roles fits that qualification. It should be said,
though, that young Anton Yelchin, seen previously as
the son of a Russian official in Along Came a Spider,
could give Haley Joel Osment a run for his money as
child acting prodigy of the moment; while Osment is
amazing at playing characters in extraordinary
situations, Yelchin, two years younger, excels at
portraying a regular kid though he, too, radiates an
intelligence beyond his years.
Had Hearts in Atlantis cut its first ten minutes and
its last five, it may have been a masterpiece;
instead, it hedges its bets on an awkward framing
device, a series of present-day scenes where an adult
Bobby is played by David Morse, that isn't in sync
with the rest of the film. It's too easy a method to
evoke a conventional feeling of "nostalgia," and it
isn't really necessary, since Hicks does a terrific
job of giving the rest of the film a nostalgic feel
without additional exposition.
King's stories rarely pull any trademark manipulative
punches, and Hearts in Atlantis has an unsentimental
streak even as it works to make you cry. It's one of
the year's most purely satisfying films. 

Title
Review for Light It Up (1999)
"First ten minutes, you made up in your mind who we were"
Starring Usher Raymond, Forest Whitaker, Rosario Dawson, Robert
Ri'chard, Fredro Starr, Vanessa L. Williams.  Rated R.
Oh how good it is, after being bombarded with redundant media coverage
of high school shootings and the prevailing violence in teenage
society, to see a mainstream film present a situation where teens that
resort to foul play aren't evil ciphers who go off the deep end for no
apparent reason. By no means does Light it Up glorify violence but it
doesn't jump to obvious conclusions about teens that are driven to it.
The characters here are not insane. They're not pushed off the edge by
violent TV shows. They're simply fed up and their reaction is more than
understandable.
The movie is set at a poor, inner-city high school and earns points
immediately by placing it in Queens, thereby offsetting the Harlem
stereotype. A full-time police officer has just been permanently placed
at Lincoln High to keep the peace. This is Officer Jackson (Forest
Whitaker), `a five dollar cop with a fifty dollar attitude.'  One day
he roughs up a kid for blocking the traffic in the hallway, which leads
to a wrestling match where the cop is shot in the leg with his own gun
and the gun goes flying to the floor. The kid grabs the gun and before
he knows it, he and a group of friends have taken the cop hostage.
There's Lester (R&B singer Usher Raymond), an intelligent, troubled boy
who is also the man with the gun and thus the ringleader; Stephanie,
who is really smart and has plans to become a doctor; Lynn, who has
just found out she is pregnant and Rodney, the obligatory homeboy.
They constantly fight over what to do next but whatever Lester says,
goes: he does, after all, have the gun.
Police surround the building. A kindly hostage negotiator (Vanessa L.
Williams) is called in. The students make a list of demands, consisting
mainly of getting their broken window fixed, their just-fired favorite
teacher rehired, textbooks for everyone, etc, etc. But the main thing
they want is respect. It can't be anything but painful to have no say
in the matter when your school is going to pieces right before your
eyes. It must be difficult to watch your future be compromised because
authority figures are performing their job inadequately. I believe
Light it Up when it says that this can get to the point where students
have no choice but to take matters into their own hands. The film
doesn't glorify this; rather, it presents it in an unbiased light.
This is a movie for teens, but then again it's not. It speaks to teens
intelligently, without condescending or trying to please. In that
sense, it's for them. But on the other hand, it may be a little too
intelligent: not enough action to interest those looking for excitement
and explosions and not enough romance to attract those of the female
persuasion. In that sense it's not. Be that as it may, this is not a
film that adults should be wary to see; just because it is about teens
does not mean it is exclusively for them and that is certainly not the
case here.
Light it Up deftly handles issues ambitious inner city kids may be
facing today, those who are actually troubled about the poor quality of
their schools. In our society, it is a contradiction when a child is
raised in a cruel, violent society and yet wants to learn. This movie
shows us how that contradiction can create an urge in teens to resort
to violence so that they can learn. It's a sad reality, but also one
that makes perfect sense given the circumstances.
Usher Raymond, a singer by trade, has a real screen presence. His
performance is intense and surprisingly powerful; like Ice Cube, Will
Smith, L.L. Cool J, and Vanessa Williams (who, of course, is in this as
well) here is another musician with the potential for a major crossover
into the movie industry. The amiable Williams is the only big star
here, making her a sort of backbone: even if a viewer hates everything
else in the movie, a good performance from a familiar face can go a
long way. She handles it well.
Though it has the tendency to rely too much on character stereotypes,
Light it Up is no formula movie. It's not a high school flick. Nor does
it exploit the recent tragedies that have occurred in the country. It
is a real film.

Review for Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)
If you could be any tree in the woods, what kind of tree would you be?"
Starring Kirstie Alley, Denise Richards, Ellen Barkin, Kirsten Dunst,
Allison Janney. Rated PG-13.
There has been a trend, in the summer of 1999, of movies that are rude,
crude, irreverent, insulting and hilarious. South Park: Bigger Longer
and Uncut and Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me are good examples
and now Drop Dead Gorgeous joins their ranks. It's a mean-spirited and
often inspired satire of beauty pageant traditions that takes absolutely
no prisoners and draws few boundaries for itself.
Drop Dead Gorgeous is actually a mockumentary: supposedly, a documentary
film crew is sent to film the events surrounding a beauty pageant in the
fictitious town of Mount Rose, Minnesota. There, girls compete for the
title of Mount Rose American Teen Princess -- and it gets ugly. There,
Gladys Leeman (Kirstie Alley), the pageant organizer, is campaigning
like mad to get her daughter, Becky Leeman (Denise Richards) to be the
winner of the pageant. That campaigning just might include killing some
of the other contestants to get them out of the way.
Then there's Amber Atkins -- the "good girl" contestant -- and the local
sentimental favorite. But she gets scared after a few contestans are
apparently killed and her mother's trailer is blown up, fusing a beer
can to her chain-smoking mother's hand. Her Mother (Ellen Barkin) almost
kills Amber herself after she tries to tell her that she wants to quit
the pageant so that she winds up staying in.
This is definitely one of the funnier movies to come along this year,
although much of the humor is mean-spirited and some even sadistic.
Rookie director Michael Patrick Jann stages all of his gags in such a
deadpan (no pun intended) style that it's difficult not to laugh. While
we may not always be proud at what we are laughing at (an anorexic
former pageant winner who just kept dieting after she won?), there's no
denying that Drop Dead Gorgeous is witty and clever.
Denise Richards gives a wonderful performance as the snotty Becky
Leeman; while I'd have to say that her performance was the most
outstanding, I also liked most of the others. Kirstie Alley is terrific
as the scheming pageant overseer and Ellen Barkin gives a funny
performance as Amber's very troubled mother.
This is clever, although admittedly not always very intelligent satire.
It may make fun of everybody it can get it's teeth on, but it's funny
and it's fun to watch. This is the kind of film that appeals to our more
sadistic sides.

Review for Men Cry Bullets (1997)
"When it comes to loss of love, men cry bullets."
Starring Starring Steven Nelson, Honey Lauren, Jeri Ryan. Not Rated
(would be a strong R due to profanity, gore and full-frontal nudity).
I'm not the kind of person you'd find automatically giving high-marks
to the avant-garde or patently bizarre. In fact, when I see a movie
that is obviously calculated to have a strikingly weird look and feel,
I make it my goal to look beyond atmosphere and see what I can find. It
is typical of modern-day independent filmmakers to use an "original"
facade to compensate for a pointless or hollow script (or no script at
all, as in the case of I Woke Up Early the Day I Died). So when I find
a film with its point as prevalent as its peculiarity, it is a find
indeed.
Which brings me to Men Cry Bullets, a remarkable little movie that's as
weird as it is complex. It marks the feature debut of short-film
veteran Tamara Hernandez, and it's impressive. Brazenly original and
visually striking, this obscure production probably won't get even a
marginally wide release, but if it does happen to open near you, take
my word for it and sprint to the theater wise enough to exhibit it.
The story seemed intriguing even before I actually saw the movie: Billy
(steven Nelson), a female impersonator with little life experience is
jostled during one of his performances by Gloria, a fiercely tough
novelist (Honey Lauren) who still lives with her parents. He goes to
her place of residence expecting an apology but what he gets instead is
his very first sexual experience. This begins a rocky, one-sided
relationship which takes our protagonist on a roller-coaster ride
because he has no control over what he has gotten himself into; the
relationship is run either by fate or by his girlfriend.
Meanwhile, Gloria's cousin Lydia(Jeri Ryan) comes to visit. She is a
gorgeous woman and Gloria is horrifically jealous; she even makes up
stories about her being in a mental institution. Well, Lydia
unwittingly kills Gloria's beloved pig and serves it in a beautifully
prepared dinner, inflaming Gloria's anger to the point where she wants
Billy to help her kill her cousin. But Billy takes a liking to the
vicious woman and begins to question who is better for him, the
abusive, relentlessly angry Gloria or the affectionate, beautiful,
arrogant Lydia.
Men Cry Bullets turns the tables on your typical abusive relationship.
This time, the male is docile and the woman is dominant. Scenes in
which Billy is being smacked around are punctuated by flashbacks of his
childhood in which he sees his mother being abused in uncannily similar
ways. These sequences are as touching as they come; compassionate,
heartfelt and very powerful. They are also cryptic, coming together to
form a complicated big picture, making the movie a terrific character
study.
Never underestimate the importance of style in an independent picture.
Thankfully, Men Cry Bullets is far from lacking in visual flair. From
the glitzy nightclub scenes to the downright gritty parts set in a
house or out in the middle of a field, it never ceases to impress
aesthetically. Adding atmosphere is an ominous, exciting soundtrack
that stays in the background much of the time but always makes an
impact.
I must caution that this isn't a movie for everyone. Some will be put
off by the subject matter, others by the graphic content. I've learned
that if I allow myself to be overly influenced by such things I'm
likely to miss the thematic undertones of a picture and will wind up
oblivious to its potential significance. If personal feelings overtly
distract from your appreciation for a motion picture, lock them out.
This film must be seen.

Title
Review for Matrix, The (1999)
Starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss. Rated R.
The Matrix is something that must be seen to be believed; a visionary
achievement in filmmaking that delights the eye and the mind alike. It hails
from the Brothers Wachowski, the duo who brought us the much-acclaimed 1996
crime caper Bound, and here they achieve a new high in stirring the
imagination while they quicken the pulse.
I will go into some plot detail here, so if you have no clue what this movie
is about and want to be surprised, skip the next two paragraphs. The story
involves a computer programmer named Neo (not accidentally an anagram for
"One"). Neo (Keanu Reeves) is singled out by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)
because Morpheus believes that Neo is "The One". In the middle of the 21st
Century, humans are celebrating the creation of the first genuine artificial
intelligence. But the AI soon gets out of control, conquers humans and finds
in them an everlasting energy source, which is something that it cannot live
without. So the AI creates "The Matrix," an elaborate computer program which
exists in the humans' mind, simulating a fully-functional life, while they
sit in incubators and are being harvested for energy.
But there is hope for humanity yet, as there is a savior waiting to be found;
a person with the power to manipulate The Matrix at will. That person died
not long after The Matrix was created, but his resurrection has been
prophesied. Now Morpheus, and his band of "unplugged" rebels believe they
have found this savior and they believe that it is Neo who is destined to
rescue humanity from slavery.
As layers of this deeply structured, well thought-out story are peeled, we
are transfixed with awe; not only because of the technical prowess with which
this movie was created, but also due to the fact that The Matrix is wildly
far- fetched and yet eerily realistic. The story seems relevant and oddly
appropriate. It makes sense because the Wachowski brothers took the time to
think it through, but also because it's a cautionary tale that has real
impact. It involves subject matter worth cautioning about.
The film's visuals are doubtlessly spectacular, rivaling the best in cinema.
When Neo is "unplugged" and we see where he really is, the world created by
the Wachowski's is amazing and the images begin to linger in your mind.
Stellar cinematography helps as well, as the film from the very beginning
sets up an atmosphere that no less than hypnotizes the viewer.
Most of the first half of this 135 minute movie is story, but in the second
half the action takes over. Brutal hand-to-hand combat and breathless,
heart-stopping shootouts abound and I could not find a false, unnecessary
moment. Part of the reason has to be the flawless choreography of the action
sequences that more- than-redeems any thinning of plot that may (but doesn't,
really) occur in the second half of The Matrix.
Neo is a role crafted precisely for Keanu Reeves. It is a non-demanding one,
that requires Reeves to act as little as possible, and to my surprise, Reeves
is effective as an action hero; even more so than he was in his superb
actioner Speed. Laurence Fishburne is absolutely perfect as Morpheus,
engimatic and sympathetic at the same time as he is intimidating.
I don't know when I'll see another sci-fi film as breathtaking or as
intelligent as The Matrix. When watching this movie I dared not blink so as
not to miss a moment. Everything from the effects to the action sequences to
the story is flawless; and the Wachowski brothers' achievement is going
directly to my Top Ten list of 1999.

Review for Double Jeopardy (1999)
"When you get out of jail, you can kill him."
Starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones, Bruce Greenwood. Rated R.
Double Jeopardy is a lurid, prepostrous thriller that's also one of the
year's most enjoyable. It's an uncompromisingly brutal, cheerfully
anarchic, hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from
it. There is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a
direct bearing on the plot; once the film gets going it never stops. It
has been branded as the female version of The Fugitive and that's
probably a correct assessment of the plot, but the film itself has
little in common with the 1993 Andrew Davis/Harrison Ford collaboration
besides the presence of star Tommy Lee Jones.
Not even bothering with character introduction, director Bruce Beresford
floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake. We meet,
rather hastily, Libby and Nick Parsons (Ashley Judd and Bruce Greenwood,
respectively) a seemingly happy married couple, with a son Matty, age 4.
They go out on a sailboat one night, and after a period of some rockin'
sex, they go to sleep. Libby hears a strange noise, wakes up and
discovers that she is covered with blood. She follows a red trail to the
upper deck, where she finds a knife and, out of astonishment, picks it
up. At that convenient moment, the coast guard shows up and Libby is
arrested.
Her lawyer, a friend, puts up a defense in court, but though we know she
is innocent, the evidence against her is too compelling. Her friend
adopts her son and she goes to prison. Once in prison, she makes a phone
call to her friend. Her friend gives her son the phone. Nick walks in
the room. Little Matty screams "Daddy!" The phone goes dead. Libby
realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead. She
gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer, who tells her that since
the state already convicted her of killing her husband, they can't
convict her of the same crime again, meaning that when she gets paroled
she can kill him and they can't touch her.
After a weirdly short amount of time, she gets out of parole. She is
sent to live at a house with other recent parolees, under the command of
parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones). She sets out on a
mission to find her husband and get her son back, which turns out to be
much more difficult than anticipated. She winds up tracking him all the
way to New Orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his
girlfriend and her son's "adopter".
Double Jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false. The law
stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes
that it is the same crime: same time, same place, same circumstances.
It's not like it matters. This is a rollickingly good thriller; intense,
exciting, fast and furious. It's silly alright, but this is the kind of
film you just don't question. In some films, plausibility is everything.
Double Jeopardy, however, is not concerned with making sense: its sole
purpose is to entertain, and it does.
Judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role. This is her
breakout box-office performance, and she is terrific. She brings some
emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role, giving the movie
a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set
pieces. Tommy Lee Jones basically just reprises the role for which he
won an Oscar in The Fugitive, but the movie makes good use of his
stone-faced wit. Thankfully, too, Double Jeopardy refrains from
developing a romance between Libby and Travis; a subplot which
doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story.
This is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys, and I took a
sort of sick pleasure in that. The sheer anarchy of the proceedings was
nothing short of wonderful, as Ashley Judd kicks the crap out of every
authority figure in the book. After all the idealistic Hollywood
features featuring hero cops, deft FBI agents and the virtues of the
American legal system, it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much
demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure.
Double Jeopardy is really good, but it isn't the kind of good that is
remembered or recognized with awards. It's one of those movies better
viewed with the brain turned off, otherwise, your brain will be busy
ruining your experience. This is a thriller that isn't concerned with
being smart or plausible. Instead it diverts all attention to the
action, which, this year, is second to none.

Review for Haunting, The (1999)
"No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than
that. In the night. In the dark."
Starring Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Luke Wilson.
Rated PG-13 (but I'd have given it an R).
The Haunting is a terrific thriller: scary, great-looking and
satisfying; it's a shame to see that many of my colleagues dislike it so
intensely. It may be a triumph of style over substance, but what a
triumph! -- with eye-popping set design, convincing special effects and
a surprisingly tense atmosphere, this is not only a strong contender for
a Best Visual Effects Oscar but also a damn good movie in its own right;
a not-so-guilty pleasure.
The film opens with surprisingly effective character introduction. We
see Eleanor "Nel" Lance (Lili Taylor, whom I mistook for Jamie Lee
Curtis) in a family crisis: her mother, whom she has selflessly taken
care of for nearly her whole life has just died, and her sister (the
executor of the estate) threatens to sell their mother's house, which
Nel is living in. The sister offers Nel an opportunity to go live with
her as a housekeeper/nanny, to which Nel responds by ordering her and
her husband to "get out of [her] home." Immediately following the
incident, she gets a mysterious phone call telling her to look at an ad
in the newspaper for an insomnia study which offers room and board and
pays $900 a week.
She volunteers for the experiment and arrives at "Hill House", a
gigantic old mansion where Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Neeson) has gathered
three subjects for a study of his, but it's not what they think. An
insomnia study it ain't; what it is, in effect, is an experiment to
discover the nature of fear. He keeps this fact secret from his human
guinea pigs because "you don't tell the rats they're actually in a
maze." He wants to use the creepy mansion to create a suggestive
environment so he can study the dynamics of fear. He slowly reveals the
frightening history of the house (sweatshops, suicides, all kinds of
scary stuff) and has the three insomniacs fill in the blanks to create a
self-inflicted nightmare.
The three "rats" are Nel; Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a frisky
bisexual; and Luke (Wilson), a hyperactive towhead. As the house (or
whoever is haunting it) toys with Nel, the others begin to think she has
gone crazy and needs supervision. Nel, meanwhile, begins to think that
she was brought to that house for a greater purpose and is determined to
find out her identity as well as the identities of those who lived in
the house.
Director Jan de Bont, who proved that he was a talented action director
with Speed before faltering with flops like Speed 2 and Twister,
provides for a terrific ride with this no-holds-barred suspenser (so
much so, in fact, that the film should have received an R rating of a
PG-13, if only because of the scene where a guy gets his head knocked
off). There are plenty of standard "boo" moments, some of which work
rather well, while spectacular effects enhance other already suspenseful
scenes.
As photographed by Caleb Deschanel, The Haunting looks terrific. The
house itself is so richly defined that it becomes a veritable character
in the movie. Brilliant camerawork only adds to that effect. With
sweeping camera zooms, lush and vibrant colors, incredible set design
and wonderful effects, even if you hate the movie itself you can still
sit back and enjoy looking at it.
The performances seem irrelevant, but they serve their purpose; Wilson,
Taylor and Zeta-Jones scream and panic very well. Only Liam Neeson fails
to be believable: when he got really really mad at one point, I burst
out laughing. An added bonus: the always delightful Marian Seldes (Home
Alone 3, Affliction) as the creepy housekeeper.
I don't tend to warm up to outright special effects extravaganzas, but
The Haunting worked for me, partly because the story was well thought
out, especially compared to most other big budget blockbusters, partly
because it contained many entertainingly intense scenes and partly
because it was so much fun to look at. I liked this movie and I don't
feel the least bit guilty.

Review for Man on the Moon (1999)
 Starring Jim Carrey, Danny DeVito, Courtney Love, Paul Giamatti.
Directed by Milos Forman. Rated R.
Despite hopes by many, myself included that the new "biopic" Man on the
Moon might shed some light on the enigmatic existence of comedian Andy
Kaufman, the man remains a mystery. This is less of a biography than it
is a series of reenactments. Director Milos Forman, the man responsible
for superb films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The People
vs. Larry Flynt delivers a film startingly lacking in insight, less of
a look at a comedy legend than a quick fast-forward through his career.
Andy Kaufman wasn't a performer. He didn't just perform his act, he
lived it. Though he himself stated that he wasn't a comedian, the whole
world , including his audience, was a joke to him. He didn't so much
aim to make people laugh as to garner some sort of reaction, whether it
be shock, resentment or disgust. He pulled stunts like wrestling women
and reading "The Great Gatsby" in front of an audience of college
students until they all left the theater. Sure, some of his schtick was
funny -- the "Mickey Mouse" lip-synch was hysterical -- but a lot of
the stuff he did was considered obnoxious. More than anything else,
that's what he was to people: obnoxious. And he liked it.
This movie very briefly chronicles Andy's relationships with his
manager George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), his girlfriend (Courtney Love)
and his favorite writer Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti). These relationships
are shown abbreviated and watered down in order to make room for the
elaborate reenactments that take up a good 80% of Man on the Moon's
running time.
I have to admit that I enjoyed parts this movie, especially Jim
Carrey's virtuoso "performance", but the whole time I wondered why it
was ever made. I could have grabbed an Andy Kaufman highlight reel and
watched it with the same exact result. Kaufman's Mickey Mouse and
wrestling routines are redone with striking attention to detail, but
for what purpose? Did Forman decide to pull a Gus Van Sant and film a
shot-by-shot remake of Kaufman's career? What, exactly, is the point?
Jim Carrey is dead-on amazing in his impersonation of Kaufman, from the
eye-rotations and the voice down to the most minute movements of the
body. He is fun to watch as an impersonator rather than a performer
almost like we're watching a feature-length mockery rather than a
movie. I don't suppose that's a fair statement, even though Man on the
Moon cheesy feel can, at times, make it seem like a mockery. I believe
that the movie was made with the best intentions at heart. It works as
a celebration of Andy Kaufman's life (after all, imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery) and it works as a method for Jim Carrey to
show off his acting chops (though as far as I'm concerned his snubbed
performance in last year's sole masterpiece The Truman Show was much
better).
I dunno. Maybe there was more here than I chose to analyze. It's
doubtful. I look at the glee with which the highlights of Kaufman's
career are recreated in this movie and it doesn't make sense to me. We
get a cursory look inside his life -- his attitude towards his insanely
popular sitcom Taxi, his relationships with his girlfriend and co-
workers -- but Milos Forman refuses to go any further. There is nothing
about what made this oddball personality tick. What were his
motivations? Considering the high expectations so many people had for
Man on the Moon, this overblown highlight reel is even more of a
disappointment. At one point in the movie, Kaufman's girlfriend tells
him "There is no real you," to which he responds "Oh yeah, I forgot."
Any biography of this man had damn well better either challenge or
explore that statement. Man on the Moon does neither.

Title
Review for Where the Money Is (2000)
Starring Linda Fiorentino, Paul Newman, Dermot Mulroney. Directed by
Michael Kanievska. Rated PG-13.
*NOTE: This review discusses some crucial plot points that you may wish
to be left in the dark about. I recommend seeing the movie first if
you're planning on doing so. The grade is a B-. You have been duly
warned.
Where the Money Is is the feel good crime movie of the year. It's a
caper film even more lighthearted than some of Elmore Leonard's work.
It tries to please everyone by being at once a bank-robber movie, a
love story, a rite-of-passage parable and under 90 minutes in length in
one fell swoop. It shouldn't surprise many that the film fully succeeds
in only the last objective but that doesn't mean that it can't be an
entertaining failure.
Linda Fiorentino, perfectly cast, plays Carol, a reasonably happy nurse
at a local nursing home. She isn't overjoyed by her job but she doesn't
resent it either; she likes people and there could be worse things out
there for her than dealing with the elderly. One day, Carol gets news
that the nursing home is getting a new addition. It seems that the
state is running out of room in its prison hospitals so they will be
sending Henry Manning (Paul Newman), a notorious bank robber who has
suffered a stroke and is now a vegetable, to Carol's establishment.
Everyone else at the nursing home is outraged about the state forcing
its leftovers on them but Carol doesn't mind: this is just another
patient on another day.
Soon, Carol begins to suspect what we have already been told by the
film's advertising campaign: that Harry is faking his stroke. She tries
to make him come out of his hiding place within himself with loud
noises and lapdances. When that doesn't work, she takes desperate
measures. She rolls him out to the lake and pushes his wheelchair along
the dock, making it fall in the water. Sure enough, Henry climbs out,
healthy as a cucumber.
Carol is compelled to help Henry keep up his charade until he can meet
up with his partner-in-crime and run off. Carol's boyfriend (Dermot
Mulroney) becomes concerned that Henry and Carol may be becoming
romantically interested in each other. Meanwhile, Henry's partner
ditches him and Carol makes a proposal: why don't the three of them do
a little bank job of their own?
Every single thing I've read about Where the Money Is insists that Paul
Newman utterly carries the movie. I beg to differ. Newman is great, as
he always is, funny, sarcastic and always entertaining. But the real
star of the movie, in my opinion, is Linda Fiorentino. I've long
thought that she livens up every movie she is in and it is gratifying
to see her finally get a lead performance. She's 40 years old and she
is still gorgeous and her quippy, charismatic way of delivering
dialogue is perfect for this movie. Her presence in even something like
Lost in Space II would make me settle comfortably in my seat.
*The next paragraph gives away the ending. If you haven't seen the film
and are still reading this despite my previous admonition, I suggest
you bail out now.
The robbery that the three attempt in the film's last third doesn't
make much sense, but that's not really a problem. I had issues with
what happened after it: Dermot Mulroney's character is blatantly turned
into a villain and Carol jumps headfirst into a completely unbelievable
love affair with Henry. I'm not even necessarily talking about the 30
year age difference between them: we just don't feel like the two have
a future together. It seems that Henry would run away at the first sign
of trouble.
The performances really anchor the movie. It's a joy to watch the
actors even when everything else fails. The plot is a mess but its
inconsistencies are -- just barely -- outshadowed.

Review for Cradle Will Rock (1999)
Starring Hank Azaria, Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Cary Elwes, Bill
Murray, Susan Sarandon, Ruben Blades, Philip Baker Hall, Angus
MacFayden, John Turturro, Emily Watson. Directed by Tim Robbins. Rated
R.
It's difficult to find an angle on the Great Depression if you're
looking to make a serious but not a depressing drama. What jumps out at
you, understandably, is the poverty and the suffering. The million
dollar challenge is to make a movie that shows all of that without
focusing on it, without taking the viewer deep into the slums of
poverty. Tim Robbins, acclaimed actor and director of Dead Man Walking
is up to the challenge. With Cradle Will Rock, Robbins has made a bona
fide period piece, a film that, through its plot and setting, conveys a
wide range of characteristics of the time and place. Roger Ebert said
that one needs a study guide to view Cradle Will Rock; I suggest that
it is an immensely entertaining study guide in itself.
In the 1930s after the stock market crashed and took the economy with
it, part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's comprehensive recovery program
known as the New Deal" was providing jobs for the many unemployed
citizens. In an effort to open position in as wide a variety of fields
as humanly possible, the Federal Theater Program was instituted.
Branches of the Federal Theater would put out wide casting calls and
put on moderately well-funded productions of plays for the general
public. A major part of everything, of course, was the Red Scare, a
nationwide Communism phobia and fear of anything deemed remotely un-
American.
Enter Mark Blitzstein (Hank Azaria). Poor and suffering from a few
mental disorders, Blitzstein wrote "Cradle Will Rock," a stage play
that may not have been quite anti-Capitalist, but was certainly anti-
Industrialist. It swept members of the working class off their feet but
understandably disconcerted the government, already concerned with a
possible proletariat rebellion. The Federal Theater decides to produce
the play, headed by a young and arrogant Orson Welles (Angus
MacFayden), but right before opening night the government decides to
shut it down.
Meanwhile, in an unrelated subplot, Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack)
hires a painter friend of his to paint a mural in the lobby of one of
Nelson's establishments. The painter also happens to be a Communist and
he incorporates Lenin and other such sensibilities into his creation.
Nelson wants very much to accomodate his buddy's whims but is very much
worried about how well his mural will be received by the public.
Joan Cusack plays an employee of the Federal Theater seemingly
brainwashed by the Red Scare; she goes to a Congressional Committee to
complain about traces of Communism in the plays the Theater puts on.
She develops a relationship with a sad, eccentric ventriloquist (Bill
Murray), who isn't quite sure what he himself thinks.
Like the higher-profile but hardly superior Magnolia, Cradle Will Rock
takes a unique approach to storytelling that is becoming increasingly
popular: taking a whole set of characters and only tangentially related
storylines and weaving them together to paint a complete picture. Since
this is in effect a period piece, that method is all the more
appropriate, and Robbins pulls it off admirably. I'm probably more
familiar with the history of the 1930s than the average person and I
was consistently impressed by how well this movie provided an
interpertation of the decade in an entertaining and surprising way. It
looks at the period from a whole new angle and puts it in a new light;
the result is an illuminating experience.
Many have criticized this movie for being overly ambitious; it does,
after all, try to tackle the stories of Nelson Rockefeller, William
Randolph Hearst, the Red Scare, the Federal Theater and the Great
Depression in general in one fell swoop. But I don't think that the
movie's purpose is to provide a complete history; rather, it tries to
take a snapshot of a time period. Robbins does not provide a lot of
background information. He takes us right into his story. What he winds
up doing is giving us an idea of what the 30s were like for a lot of
people -- but not necessarily how it came to be that way or even why
it's that way. He gives us the bare necessities so that we are not
thoroughly confused, but that is all. This isn't a textbook translated
to celluloid nor does it try to be one.
...and it all works like a gem. This is one of the very best films of
the year, a sweeping, enjoyable, thought-provoking epic that respects,
educates and entertains the audience all at the same time. Tim Robbins
doesn't direct very often -- he prefers to act and is superb at that,
too -- but when he does go behind the camera, what comes out is second
to none.

Title
Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
 Starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Jake Lloyd, Natalie Portman,
Samuel L. Jackson. Rated PG.
The event of events is upon us. People have waited twenty-two years for
the prequel to Star Wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at
theaters for months to get tickets to see it. I don't think that America
will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has
caused. It is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most
highly anticipated movie in history. Anyone who tells you "It's just a
movie" is either lying or clueless.
It is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually
seeing the movie will be anticlimactic. The second coming of the Lord
could not live up to the kind of buzz (which is far too weak a word)
that Star Wars Epsode I: The Phantom Menace so effortlessly generated.
But that does not mean that the film itself is bad. In fact, it is
terrific. I strongly suspect that many of the people who were
dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the
inevitable backlash.
It is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 Star Wars
took place. The film focuses on the fledgling Republic of Planets and
the conflict that is raging: The Trade Federation, angry at some tax
raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small, peaceful
planet of Naboo. The Republic sent two Jedi Knights (people that can
actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "The Force"),
Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) to
negotiate. Unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur,
the Jedi and the Queen of Naboo (Natalie Portman) escape Naboo and head
for Coruscant to try and get the Republic Senate to intervene.
On the way they get sidetracked to a planet called Tatooine, where they
meet the movie's real focal point, young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd).
He is an innocent slave boy, but "the force is strong with him" so Qui-
Gon is determined to take him with them to the Jedi counsel and get him
trained as a Jedi. As any self-respecting Star Wars fan should know,
Anakin will grow up to be Darth Vader and give birth to Luke Skywalker.
>From the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie.
Around 70% of the characters, if not more, are computer generated in one
form or another, and though the effects are seamless, the movie lacks
soul. I think that although the computer has played an incredibly
instrumental part in moviemaking this decade, cinema should still be a
human art and The Phantom Menace nearly defies this.
This is the lightest installment in the Star Wars saga thus far, with
plenty of broad comic relief to go around, much of it courtesy of an
irritating knew character named Jar-Jar Binks. He's essentially a
computer-animated sidekick who says things like "Exqueeze Me?" and "Mesa
go now, okeday?", and although it is often amusing it is also inherently
annoying.
The visual effects are astounding (although director George Lucas often
chickens out by cutting away from them) and the movie is a thrilling
triumph. If it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through
imagination and excitement. The climactic lightsaber battle (oh, come
on, as if you didn't already know), among other things, is outrageously
entertaining and defines the term "popcorn movie".
What made me surrender and give this movie ***1/2 stars was the score by
John Williams. Even though it does seem like the man scores every single
movie that comes out these days, his work here is nothing short of
brilliant. His use of opera during the climax really does add a punch
and his ingenious way of utilizing the Imperial March as a sort of
prophecy is chilling.
The Phantom Menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia. When you
see "A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", when the familiar
music plays, when the words "Star Wars" appear on screen, you'll feel a
tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77.
It feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young Anakin, a boy whose
innocence, we know, will be taken away and who will soon cross over to
the dark side. It is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the
Jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the Jedi arts; we know that it
will do more harm than good, but they do not. We not only feel more
involved in the story, but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a
saga that we have cherished for years.
The Phantom Menace, although lacking in human aspects of the story, is a
very worthy installment in the Star Wars. It works as an action flick,
visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting; it also works as
an elicitor of memories, a piece of exquisite nostalgia.

Title
Review for Big Daddy (1999)
Starring Adam Sandler, Cole Sprouse, Dylan Sprouse, Joey Lauren Adams,
Steve Buscemi, Leslie Mann. Rated PG-13.
Adam Sandler has become one of the most bankable stars of the decade,
with an impressive list of box-office and video winners under his belt.
It's a shame that his films aren't as consistently good cinematically as
they are at the box-office; since he became popular, they have ranged
from the sublime (Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer) to the abysmal
(Billy Madison, The Waterboy). Now comes Big Daddy, a film that has more
in common with Wedding Singer than any of the other films, but lacks
that comedy's charm, replacing it with hackneyed aaw-gosh sweetness
which is the last thing we want to see from Sandler.
Many parts of Big Daddy's premise are by now trite: Sonny Koufax, a law
school graduate who decided to throw his life away and become a toll
collector, stumbles upon a 5 year old kid named Julian, evidently the
son of one of his pals, who he never knew had a son. The boy's father
just left the country on business and isn't expected to be back for a
few months. At first Sonny decides to keep the kid at his house for the
night and give him to social services in the morning.
When he comes to social services, posing as the father, to give the kid
away to a foster family, he changes his mind and decides to keep the
little bugger. He does it so that he can impress his girlfriend (Joey
Lauren Adams), who insists that Sonny "refuses to move on to the next
stage of [his] life." He hopes that this kid can strengthen their
volatile relationship much like a woman might get pregnant to save a
marriage.
Much to Sonny's surprise, his girlfriend has already dumped him for an
old guy with a five-year plan, and he finds that he is stuck with the
kid until social services can line up a foster family for him.
Inevitably, Sonny and Julian build a relationship of their own, Julian
becoming a son to Sonny and Sonny a father to Julian. But all can't be
that simple as social services discover that Sonny isn't really Julian's
father and threaten arrest.
I can't say that I was bored watching Big Daddy because it is an utterly
harmless, lighthearted film. Admittedly some of it is amusing, and some
irresistibly cute. But David Dugan, who worked with Sandler previously
on Happy Gilmore (aside from lensing losers such as Problem Child and
Beverly Hills Ninja) proves incapable of maintaining the hilarity, nor
can he introduce any credible pathos to keep us emotionally involved
with these characters.
Part of the problem, I think, is that Adam Sandler isn't effective as
the responsible type (although watching Adam the parent is better than
Adam the retard as in Waterboy). He has much more success playing the
lovable, desparate loser, such as he did in Gilmore and Singer than he
does playing a father figure. I'm sorry, but it's painful to watch
Sandler carefully bathing a 5 year old -- he has never been that sort of
persona and he fails to turn himself into one for the role.
The action builds up to a mind-bogglingly asinine courtroom scene, in
which Sandler has to deliver a pseudo-inspirational speech about
responsibility. Somebody gag me. His movies have thus far avoided this
sort of phony sentimentality, and even the most awful ones were better
for it. Whoever inspired Sandler (who, as I hear, was the final
authority on the film's script even though he didn't write it) or the
writer to go for the lurid hokeyness present throughout the last third
of Big Daddy should be credited for putting the stake through the film's
metaphorical heart.
Big Daddy isn't an insult to humanity, it's merely pure and constant
mediocrity. The laughs are few and far between and the movie never
succeeds in developing any sort of dramatic tension. I expected better
from Sandler, even though I've seen far worse from him.

Review for Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season (1999)
 Starring Zachary Browne, Michael Moriarty, Rod Steiger, Scott Wilson.
Rated PG.
Have parents not complained about the current lack of wholesome family
entertainment? Have critics not bashed the film industry for not putting
out movies that can entertain children without bombarding them with
high-tech special effects? They have, making the fact that Shiloh 2:
Shiloh Season wasn't a box office hit all the more a surprise. It went
nowhere during its admittedly limited theatrical release which signifies
a certain hypocrisy on the part of some parents: how can they rant that
there isn't anything good for their children to watch and then when
something good hits the screens not seek it out?
Shiloh Season is based on the novel of the same name by Phyllis Reynolds
Naylor and it is a sequel to Shiloh, likewise both a novel and a movie.
The first film had little Marty Preston attempting to save a mistreated
beagle from Judd Travers, its cruel owner and the town drunk. He managed
to get the dog and keep it but Judd isn't over it yet. He wants revenge
and he wants the dog back.
Marty, I suspect, would rather give away his little sister than his
beloved beagle so to him, giving the dog back to Judd to avoid trouble
is out of the question. He blatantly refuses and his father (Michael
Moriarty) supports him. But Judd isn't ready to give up so easily. He
begins to blame Marty for various things that mysteriously happen around
his residence, such as his mailbox being knocked over, his truck getting
scratched and his dogs being set loose and biting Marty's sister. Marty
insists that he didn't do any of those things; we, along with his
parents, believe him.
Marty wants to see if he can change Judd; make him a better person by
being nice to him. That's a refreshingly simple concept: here is a
person deeply scarred by events of his childhood, so what better way is
there to change him than to show him compassion? A little kindness, as
opposed to a lot of therapy, goes a long way.
Inspector Gadget this ain't. In fact, Shiloh Season has an almost
frustratingly no-frills attitude; in part, I'm sure, because of its
limited budget but also because it is interested in emphasizing good
values rather than cool effects. That's not to say that it doesn't
entertain in the process: kids will love it and adults who allow
themselves to be won over by it should not be squirming in their seats.
It's a family film, not a kid flick; a movie that might be targeted at
the young ones but can be enjoyed by the parents as well.
What this isn't is the story of a boy and his dog; it's a part of the
plot but a minor one. You'll be hard-pressed to find a moment where
director Sandy Tung tries to get an "Aaaaaaw" out of the audience with
Shiloh's cuteness. Instead, it's a simple but sincere exploration of
human nature. What makes "bad" people? Can we change them? If we can,
how? These are questions that Shiloh Season tries to answer for kids
while leaving enough open for discussions with parents. It's a fun
movie, but it's also, in its own right, an important one.
Unfortunately, with all the big-budget "family" films around, not a lot
of kids want to see stuff like this, and in accordance to the laws of
supply and demand, not a lot of it is released. That is a reason why,
now that Shiloh Season is on video, you should rent it. Don't deny
yourself or your kids the experience of a moral, wholesome family film;
now a rare breed.

Review for Bats (1999/I)
Starring Lou Diamond Phillips, Dina Meyer, Bob Gunton. Rated PG-13.
Bats is this year's camp flick. With the world's worst dialogue,
cheesiest premise and stupidest editor, this one should be heaven for
those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity. As for the rest of us,
well... I'd say skip it, but looking at the box office figures for this
one, it seems as though most of America is following that advice
anyway. Follow their lead and you'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your
life and 8 bucks to boot.
I love Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, almost as much as I love the short
story on which it is based. It saddens me even more, then, to see that
American Treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock
such as Bats. When mysterious bat attacks occur in a small Texas town,
the authorities call in a batologist (Dina Meyer) to investigate. It
turns out that a creepy scientist (Bob Gunton) has genetically enhanced
a couple bats that escaped from his lab, making them smarter and more
vicious. Why has he done this, you ask? Because, you see, it is
apparently a scientist's job to make things "a little better," even if
that means the death of all mankind.
So the batologist, her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff (Lou
Diamond Phillips) have to kill all the bats and save the world. Of
course, that can't happen before they wallow in some guamo (bat shit,
for the uninitiated), get up close and personal with some truly
repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations
ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture. Consider, for
example, a scene where two people are in a bat cave. The bats are all
sleeping, but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can
get out. What do they do? Do they get the hell out of there as fast as
they can? Nope. They stand there for a while, transfixed by the
thousands of bats opening their eyes.
What keeps Bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing
in most of the attack scenes. We don't even get to see what's going on;
the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick. All we know is
that bats are attacking. How they are attacking and what exactly is
happening remains a mystery. A little technical proficiency does
wonders for horror movies, and Bats sure could use some.
Of course, director Louis Morneau tries to liven things up with some
intentional humor, but it is so conventional it doesn't really go
anywhere. Most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist's
wisecracking sidekick (Leon), who takes every opportunity to sputter
ingenious lines like "I hate bats!" Some of these are so bad that they
take on a double quality: they may inspire a smirk by their very nature
and a roaring laugh because they are so inept. I hate characters who
exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners. Playing such
characters does not help actors' careers.
Still, I suppose that if you're looking for a movie that is "so bad
it's good," you could do worse than Bats. It does have a tremendous
amount of camp value. I'm not "recommending" the movie because, quite
frankly, it sucks, and I know that this might convince some people to
go out and see it. More power to them.

Review for 8MM (1999)
 Starring Nicholas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, Michael Stormare. Rated R.
Director Joel Schumacher must be a very hated man. He is, after all,
responsible for single-handedly destroying the whole Batman franchise
with the embarrassing Batman & Robin. Is it fair, for Batman fans
everywhere, to say that Schumacher redeems himself with 8MM? Well,
perhaps not. And I suppose there is no form of redemption for making an
awful movie; that'll stay with you forever. But in its own right, the
new Nicolas Cage thriller 8MM is an excellent film.
The ordinary-man-suddenly-thrown-into-oblivion story has been told over
and over, both by excellent films (Enemy of the State, A Simple Plan,
The Man Who Knew Too Much) and not-so-excellent ones (In Dreams, etc.).
And, I suppose, 8MM is another of these films, but instead of it being
the whole movie, it uses that general storyline framework as a set-up
for bigger and better things. Cage plays Private Detective Tom Welles, a
loving husband dedicated to his profession, who spends most of his time
following around various adulterers and other such scum. So, it is
rather surprising to him when he is called in by the wife of a recently
deceased millionare. It seems that she has found a film in her husband's
safe that seems to depict a girl being brutally raped and murdered.
Welles' mission, which he chooses to accept, is to find out whether that
girl was really killed in that film.
He tackles the problem head-on by going to Cleveland and by visiting a
part of that city known as an adult entertainment heaven. He enlists the
help of an intelligent but destitute porn store clerk, Max, to acquaint
him with the dark world of hard-core pornography. He begins to dig deep,
and finds out that "snuff" films, a sort of "urban legend" in the porn
world really do exist. For the uninitiated (God, I hope there are many
of you out there), a "snuff" film is an unproffesionally made porno
where one of the stars is beaten and killed.
>From a technical perspective, this is a fine achievement. Filmed in
bleak, dark tones, 8MM is a beautifully moody picture, even if it
doesn't present any original concept in cinematography (and it didn't
have to, either). The movie's general style resembles that of last
year's A Perfect Murder in camerawork, lighting and tone.
As Welles submerges himself in this insane world, he begins to wrestle
with murderous instincts. But he is not a killer. At one point, in a
very powerful scene, he has to call a family member of one of the
victims to literally talk him into killing one of the villains.
Schumacher tries to touch on many philosophical concepts in 8MM. Some
work, some don't, but his movie is really notable for many very
suspenseful scenes, compelling action, and for building up a steady
rhythm that really draws the audience in. Cage gives a none-too-subtle
but still riveting performance as Welles, but his performance gets is
quite overstated if you watch closely.
8MM is quite graphic in terms of depiction of these "snuff" films, but
it manages not to stray into NC-17 category. Still, I would guess that
many people would find much of this film disturbing, and some might even
think of it as repulsive. But try and look beyond the violence. Welles'
reaction to everything he sees is quite real. The villains' motives as
depicted here are rather thought-provoking. When you really look, 8MM is
quite a restrained, even timid picture when you think about what it
could have been. Had it been an "exploitation" movie, much like the porn
that it's about, my reaction would have certainly been different.
Nor is this a preachy "porn is bad" movie, as a matter of fact 8MM does
not seem to be too concerned with porn. It seems to be trying to get a
message through our heads that has to do with criminality in general.
The notion that all criminals have a troubled past is what Schumacher
seems to be trying to disprove ("I do these things because I want to.
Because I like them"). Like last year's Enemy of the State, 8MM uses
action and violence for something other than simply displaying action
and violence.
This is Schumacher's breakthrough film, his first good one since Falling
Down. It's a comlpex achievement; exciting, sad and profound at the same
time. It's also one of the year's first pleasant surprises.

Review for What Planet Are You From? (2000)
Starring Garry Shandling, Annette Bening, John Goodman, Greg Kinnear,
Ben Kingsley, Linda Fiorentino. Directed by Mike Nichols. Rated R.
One of the most important rules of making a comedy is that you can't
have it both ways. You can either have a goofball, irreverent,
slapstick jamboree, in which case it has to be funny, but isn't
required to make a whole lot of sense. Or you can aim higher and make a
more ambitious movie, raunchy at director's discretion but also
insightful and intelligent. The latter, however, has one catch: it has
to have a thought-out plot. Mike Nichols's new movie What Planet Are
You From? is missing that last all-important component.
"Men are from Mars, Woman are from Venus" and Harold Anderson (Garry
Shandling) is from somewhere way the hell out there. Literally. He's an
alien from another planet and he has come to earth to procreate in
order to assist his homeworld's plans for universe domination. There
are a couple of problems. His planet consists of an all-male population
and he has no experience with human females. The catch phrases he
learned, such as "You smell good" and "I like your shoes" obviously
don't cut it. Also, he is missing the crucial equipment so it has to be
installed -- and whenever he is aroused, it hums. Yes, that's right --
it hums.
Harold takes a liking to Susan, a real estate agent/recovering
alcoholic (Annette Bening, playing a real estate agent for the second
time in a row). She is vulnerable at the time and she marries him on
the spot. Their relationship doesn't exactly take off because all the
groom cares about is that baby while the blushing bride worries that
she may be sterile. Meanwhile, a Federal Aviation Administration agent
(John Goodman) notices some strange things and gets on Harold's trail.
There are actually a lot of good things to say about What Planet Are
You From?. First and foremost is Annette Bening's performance which is
the best of the movie. In her last film, American Beauty, her gem of a
performance went somewhat underappreciated (even though, oddly enough,
it got an Oscar nomination) because it was upstaged by the acting
behemoth that is Kevin Spacey and the film's generally bizarre nature.
Here, she gets a chance to shine; there is a scene where she does an
uproarious song-and-dance rendition of "High Hopes" that won't soon
leave my memory.
Garry Shandling doesn't have the best comic timing around, but he is a
whiz of facial expressions and because of the nature of his
performance, he is often dead-on. The running gag, of course, is the
humming genitalia, which somehow manages not to turn this into a one
joke movie. It gets somewhat predictable, but never old.
The movie really is quite funny, and at times affecting, but as a whole
it doesn't hold up. It feels incomplete because while the film seems to
actually care about the characters and their emotionss, it doesn't have
an iota of concern for its plot. Nothing makes sense. The film doesn't
bother to explain anything about the aliens' background or what exactly
it is they are here for. The whole scenario remains irritatingly
ambiguous, preventing us from ever actually caring about what happens
on screen. The film's set-up fits a Saturday Night Live sketch better
than a full-length movie.
I have seen far worse comedies about aliens from outer space. What
Planet Are You From? at least manages to keep us from squirming in our
seats even if it never realizes its ambitions of involving our
emotions. Garry Shandling, in his first movie since completing his
Larry Sanders Show stint on HBO, looks promising for a lively big-
screen career. And Mike Nichols, who is revered for making comedies
with a compelling human side has made a movie that barely skims the
surface when it needed so desperately to dig a little deeper.

Title
Review for My Dog Skip (2000)
Starring Frankie Muniz, Luke Wilson, Kevin Bacon, Diane Lane. Directed
by Jay Russell. Rated PG.
Boy-and-his-dog tales are one of the oldest staples in Hollywood. From
Lassie to Old Yeller to Shiloh, they've defined the "family movie" and
captured the hearts of generations. My Dog Skip, the latest in the
genre, is one of the best films of its kind. It's remarkable because it
doesn't patronize or condescend -- this is truly a family movie, not a
kids' movie. With its distinctive, unsentimental tone, it's a moving
experience that never descends into melodrama and hokum. My dog's name
is Phil. He's a cocker spaniel. While not the trained movie pet Skip
is, he's a hell of a dog. This movie made me realize how much I value
my pet -- my friend, my companion.
Before he found fame on the popular new tv show Malcolm in the Middle,
young Frankie Muniz played Willie, a boy growing up in 1940's Missouri.
He's not very social; all the kids at school make fun of him and the
bullies cruelly taunt him. He doesn't have any friends his age; his
birthday party invitation list consists of his parents and
grandparents. His only companion is neighbor Dick Jenkins (Luke
Wilson), an athlete whom all the kids in the town look up to.
That all changes when, for his birthday, Willie's mom (Diane Lane)
gives him a puppy. Willie names the terrier Skip but his dad (Kevin
Bacon) thinks that he is not ready for a dog and tries to take Skip
away. Mom and Skip win out in the end, however, and Willie gets to keep
the dog. The two quickly become best companions and with Skip's help,
Willie wins the friendship of the people who made fun of him most
vigorously as well as the affections of the prettiest girl in school.
There is also a subplot about moonshiners who, for some reason, hide
their booze in an old cemetery crypt. It does little except create
vital conflicts for the dynamic duo of Willie and Skip to deal with.
There's so little lip service paid to these scenes that the movie all
but acknowledges the subplot as a mere plot device, thereby making it
especially convenient for us to ignore it. My Dog Skip tackles the age-
old concept of a dog being a boy's best friend but it takes it one step
further: Skip isn't merely Willie's friend, he's his key to society.
The dog opens up new possibilities for him, helps him make friends,
enjoy childhood. This isn't necessarily a case of a boy moving up in
the world simply because of possessions either: once he's in he stays
in with character, heart and compassion. While the dog is given its
fair due, by the end of the film most of the emphasis has been placed
on the human. We really feel that Willie has been changed forever. And
we see why.
Muniz is a wonderful actor mainly because of his penchant for
downplaying crucial scenes. He's a real kid rather than a movie kid and
anyone who's ever been in his situation can identify with him. He
doesn't come off as a phony. Kevin Bacon does come off as a bit of a
phony -- too thoughtless at first (sometimes, puffing his cigar, he
seems genuinely malevolent) and then becoming a caring father too
quickly. But I suppose this is what the character would seem like to a
grown man remembering his childhood.
The end of the film brought tears to my eyes because it hits the nail
squarely on the head. If a pet has the more of an influence on a
person's life than most of the humans, it does not mean that he is
antisocial. As anyone who has ever had a dog knows, a canine is often
the most steadfast, loyal friend you'll have. They can change your
life, mend your heart, listen to your troubles and lift your spirits.
My Dog Skip is about a dog that taught a troubled young boy how to
live.

Title
Review for Glass House, The (2001/I)
"Even the guardians let down their guard."
Starring Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan
Skarsgard, Bruce Dern. Directed by Daniel Sackheim.
Rated PG-13.
The Glass House is a fun little piece of schlock, a
soft thriller with some good ideas and a proactive
heroine. Its plot is too obvious to provide any real
what-happens-next suspense, but there are still
moments here to treasure. And, if after seeing her in
some seven movies, I still say that lead actress
Leelee Sobieski "shows promise," it's because she
hasn't been given a real role yet (no, Here on Earth
doesn't count, and I haven't seen her in the title
role of the tv movie Joan of Arc).
Here she plays Ruby Baker, a relatively average
teenager who goes to school, smokes up and has wild
nights out with her friends unbeknownst to her
parents. When said parents are killed in a car
accident, Ruby and her younger brother have to move in
with the Glasses, a rich couple with an amazing house
in Malibu and seemingly unlimited funds at their
disposal.
But in this house, as the film's advertising didn't
fail to tell us a thousand times, things are not as
they seem. It soon becomes obvious to everyone but the
main character that the Glasses, well-played by Diane
Lane and Stellan Skarsgard, plan to use Ruby and her
brother as their "personal piggy-bank," using the
money left to them in their parents' will, as well as
incidentals like their private school tuition, to pay
off their enormous debts.
The Glass House really doesn't come together as well
as it could have, what with the lapses in logic and
virtual lack of tension outside of neat individual
moments. But the movie is well-photographed by
tv-veteran director Daniel Sackheim, and it has a
marvelous production design: the house itself, with
its imposing architecture and, appropriately, glass
walls, has its own menace aside from that of its shady
occupants.
I also liked the back-and-forth between Ruby and her
brother, a series of authentic exchanges that is a
welcome respite from the contrived trappings of the
thriller's main storyline. Sobieski, true to form,
manages to build a character from a screenplay that
doesn't give her one; I'd still like to see her pull a
Thora Birch and do something unconventional. If she
can do this much with a script that actually exhibits
below-average level of writing, he sky's the limit.
And comedy remains an entirely unexplored field.
Diane Lane has slipped under Hollywood's collective
radar -- I don't think I've ever actually seen her
name in print outside of the obligatory "starring"
blurb -- but she is a dependable actress, skilled at
portraying seemingly everyday characters with
something else under the surface. And you almost feel
sorry for Stellan Skarsgard, a pure character actor
who doesn't seem to be having a good time; this script
is a deathtrap.
A better film could have been made from this material.
I could have used more careful plotting and less of
the characters having to catch up to us. I'm
recommending The Glass House, though, because there's
something inherently appealing about its plot (it's
hard to completely screw up an orphan-makes-good
tale); perhaps also because I watched it right after
The Musketeer, which momentarily destroyed my faith in
cinema. 

Title
Review for Wonder Boys (2000)
Starring Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert
Downey Jr. Directed by Curtis Hanson. Rated R.
Wonder Boys is a quirky little comedy, eccentric almost to the point of
inaccessability. It succeeds as an unorthodox Michael Douglas vehicle --
 this is his first un-Gordon-Gekko role since 1995 -- but it would have
worked better if the writer tried less to be risque and harder to be
funny. The movie is still a winner, in it's own breezy, lighthearted
way but for director Curtis Hanson, made famous by the far more
heavyweight L.A. Confidential, this is hardly something to write home
about.
Douglas plays Grady Tripp a struggling writer and English professor
who, in middle age, has descended into a world of his own. He teaches
his classes almost in a trancelike state, smokes pot and works on his
second novel -- his first, published decades ago, was a runaway hit.
His new one is up to 2600 pages with no end in sight. But Grady doesn't
care. He just keeps on writing in the hopes that maybe in the distant
future, he'll be able to do something with it.
Meanwhile, Grady has an affair with the college's chancellor (Frances
McDormand). He finds out that she is pregnant -- presumably with his
baby. He seems too submerged inside his own mind to care or do anything
about this development. His whole life seems to change in inexplicable
ways, however, when a student named James Leer (Tobey Maguire) enters
the scene. James is an aspiring writer who may or may not be good, a
liar and an altogether difficult person. And yet Grady finds himself
connecting with James for reasons he is unsure of.
Most of the laughs in this movie stem from the script's bizarreness
rather than its cleverness. There are times when the film tries to be
weird just for the sake of being weird. The past few months have been
peppered with unusual scripts, but the outstanding ones have blended
the bizarre with the original while maintaining a sense of purpose. You
can't have insanity without reason.
Still, Wonder Boys is a winner because Grady is such a lovable lug. He
is so lost and so confused that our hearts go out to him. Douglas, in a
wonderful performance, milks this quality for all it's worth. It's fun
to watch him transform from the contemptuous, greedy tycoon that he
played in his last three movies to the veritable puppy dog he is here.
Sometimes, we just want to reach into the screen and pet him on the
head.
The supporting characters are much less approachable, though they're
often funny. Maguire's James Leer, especially, remains a cipher. There
are many attempts to humanize him, but he always remains too quirky and
too contrived for us to believe that he is real. This is not to berate
Tobey Maguire, who does the best he can with the script and turns in an
amusing, if not an affecting performance.
By the end, Grady Tripp has completed a journey and undergone a
transformation. We're with him every step of the way. Sort of. The
trouble is that none of the supporting characters matter. They're all
there to propel the plot along, to act as forces in Grady Tripp's life.
They have no human qualities. I suppose that was the intention: to a
man so utterly stoned as Grady, hardly anyone around him would have
human qualities. Still, I wished for more than one interesting
character. After all, even the most interesting element will get tiring
after a while, if there is nothing to back it up. Fortunately, Wonder
Boys runs a mere 112 minutes.

Title
Review for Jeepers Creepers (2001)
Jeepers Creepers is a functional, crafty, genuinely
scary little chiller that delivers exactly what it
promises and more. There's nothing extraordinary about
it - except, perhaps, the ending; more on that later -
but it's a masterpiece of utilitarian effectiveness.
My friends tell me that copious amounts of movies have
desensitized me to the thrills of a good horror flick;
it's saying something, then, that during Jeepers
Creepers I had to look at the people around me and
remind myself that it's only a movie.
Horror movie characters are almost invariably "hip"
now, flouting the clichés of the genre while at the
same time bowing to them. So I was pleasantly
surprised to see one that - with the exception of a
single, inconsequential line of dialogue - plays it
completely straight. It begins with Trish and Darry, a
brother and sister - the lack of a token "romance" is
also refreshing - driving on a deserted rural road.
Their bickering is interrupted when they are hassled
by an old farm truck that pulls up behind hen, bumps
them, swerves, honks, and finally runs their car off
the road and into a field. They dust themselves off,
recover, mutter something to the effect of "crazy
asshole" to themselves and continue on their way.
A few minutes later, they pass an abandoned church.
The menacing truck is parked nearby, and a
shady-looking man is throwing elongated objects
wrapped in red-stained sheets down a pipe. Rattled,
they pull over a couple of miles down the road. After
deliberation, they decide to go to the nearest police
station, alert the authorities and be on their way.
Well, that would have been the smart thing to do, at
least. But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we?
Actually, they decide to go back and investigate, with
the hopes of helping anyone who is still alive. And
though this action is undoubtedly stupid, Darry's
childlike curiosity is almost believable, like a
preteen's fascination with the hospital morgue or the
graveyard. What they find matches both of those
descriptions, and before long they are chased by that
same old farm truck, the driver's identity remaining a
secret until they get a mysterious phone call from a
psychic who tells them that once it has their scent,
it won't chase them to the end of the earth and back.
Though Jeepers Creepers does not occupy a respected
genre, it is charged, masterful filmmaking. It cuts
through the crap associated with teen horror films -
pop-culture-filled dialogue, corny in-jokes, love
triangles - and gives us what we want: white-knuckle
suspense, good jolts, serviceable acting and a villain
who is actually scary. Even the title, which seems at
first like the creation of a mildly retarded
publicist, has a logical and frightening relevance to
the plot.
Justin Long and Gina Phillips are competent in the
lead roles, which is all that the plot requires. We
sympathize: they're frightened and so are we. The
opening sequence, the only part of the film that can
be described as "low-key" also establishes their
characters as likeable, which is a plus because it
ensures that we won't be cheering for them to be
eaten.
Then there's the ending, which is as abrupt as it is
surprising. I'll say nothing more about it, except to
mention that though others in the theater were
shouting "That's it?!" I found it more satisfying than
any number of conventional dispatchings of the villain
that you always see in monster movies. I expected
another fade-in, and had to sit there and blink for a
while when the credits unexpectedly began to roll.
That sort of incredulous shock is what Jeepers
Creepers is all about. 

Title
Review for Beach, The (2000)
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume
Canet. Directed by Danny Boyle. Rated R.
After a weirdly long two-year hiatus, the Titanic heartthrob is finally
back on screen but with a whimper rather than a bang. He has chosen The
Beach, an unusual film with a woefully confused script, one that
obviously wants to say something but is not sure what. Leonardo
Dicaprio's intense presence brings a visceral quality to the
proceedings but doesn't make the movie any less pretentious.
Someone should explain to Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) why most
directors take a few minutes at the beginning of the movie to let us
get accustomed to the characters, because Boyle forgets. He jumps
abruptly out of the starting gate with a voiceover from our
protagonist, a young tourist named Richard (DiCaprio). Richard is in
Bangkok -- why he is there and where he is from, we are not told. He is
exploring, experimenting with the city's vibrant culture (this, of
course, involves drinking some tasty-looking snake blood), looking for
something bigger than himself. Sitting in his ratty hotel room one
night, he encounters a crazy guy named, not surprisingly, Daffy (Robert
Carlyle) who tells him about an island paradise, an idyllic world of
white sands, clear waters and all the pot you can smoke.
Daffy also gives Richard a map, detailing how to get to the island. He
recruits a French couple next door, Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and
Etienne (Guillaume Canet) and they are off in search of paradise. After
no small amount of effort, they finally reach their destination only to
be shot at by some mysterious marijuana farmers. They run off to the
other side of the island where they find what they were looking for --
a society of settlers living off the land. They rarely get off the
island and when they do, they are bound by a code of secrecy: the
farmers on the other side agreed to let them stay under the condition
that no other people come. The settlers, led by a mildly obsessed lady
named Cindy (Tilda Swinton) accept Richard, Francoise and the foxy
Etienne into their circle, but Richard realizes that he gave a copy of
the map to a bunch of pot-smoking idiots back on the mainland, possibly
endangering the future of this paradise.
There are, of course, chase scenes, shark attacks and other such
diversions. These are handled quite well by both Boyle and Dicaprio.
Boyle keeps the suspense up and Dicaprio is starting to show a real
screen presence, even if he still isn't the most expensive of actors.
Indeed the visceral level of The Beach has no problems at all, helped
out in a big way by the gorgeous scenery. Filmed in Thailand, the movie
is covered when it comes to sand and water. What it could have used to
supplement the pretty pictures is a clear sense of where it was headed
and what it was trying to say because the version that makes it onto
the screen is hopelessly lost within itself.
About halfway through, the storyline curves sharply. The protagonist
seems to become a modern-day Tarzan, going halfway insane and the movie
becomes annoyingly self-conscious. Its final message -- that there is
no such thing as paradise but the fun moments you have will last
forever -- is outrageous. What fun times? Almost being eaten alive?
Getting shot at? Having to leave a shark-bitten friend in the woods to
die? I have a feeling Boyle is trying to kill too many birds with one
stone here and as a result confuses himself -- and us -- completely.
Still, a lot of people are apt to walk away happy from this. Leo fans
will be delighted, as will fans of suspense genre films. But The Beach
overreaches its aim and when all is said and done, it falls flat on its
face thematically, if not viscerally.

Title
Review for Deep End, The (2001)
Starring Tilda Swinton, Goran Visnjic, Jonathan
Tucker, Peter Donat. Directed by Scott McGehee and
David Siegel. Rated R.
The Deep End is one of the noblest failures that I've
had the mixed pleasure of seeing this year. The
well-reviewed suspense drama has the best of
intentions but it doesn't follow through. Its slow,
somber tone works but its story is a pretentious flop.
The filmmakers were so eager to make a story about a
woman's maternal instincts taken to the nth power that
they forgot to make the circumstances surrounding the
protagonist even remotely plausible.
The film opens with a knock on the door, and the sight
of Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton) entering what seems
to be some sort of gay club and telling a guy to stay
away from her son or else. She has reason to be
worried. Beau (Jonathan Tucker), withdrawn, reserved,
and closeted, has formed an unhealthy relationship
with much-older Darby (Josh Lucas). Darby offers to
keep away, for a healthy sum of $5,000.
The next morning, after a confusing and potentially
incriminating series of events, Margaret finds Darby's
body lying by her dock. She assumes, not unreasonably,
that Beau is in some way responsible, or at the very
least that he will be a potential suspect in the
impending investigation. So she does what any sensible
mother would do: load the body into the motorboat and
dump it in the middle of Lake Tahoe.
Wait, no, that's emphatically not what a sensible
mother would do, but I'm willing to forgive the
logical misstep because if she didn't dump the body,
there would be no movie. But then things get really
strange. Margaret is approached by Alek (Goran
Visnjic), a strange man with a video tape of Beau
having sex with Darby. He demands fifty thousand
dollars to keep the tape out of the police's grubby
little hands. She says she has no way to get the
money. He says he doesn't care.
What I always find strange in movies like this is why
the blackmailee never calls the blackmailer's bluff. I
recall Ron Howard's underrated Ransom, which turned
this convention on its head. If Alek and his partner
in crime hand the tape over, the whole endeavor has
been worthless and they walk away empty-handed. I've
always thought this to be an unlikely scenario under
any circumstances. If Margaret hands over the money,
she may see the tape destroyed, but who says they
don't have other copies and who says they won't come
after her again?
Never mind. I can forgive this as well. The Deep End
nails shut its own coffin with a ludicrous plot twist
in which Alek evidently gets cold feet and
inexplicably sympathizes with Margaret. In the climax,
the protagonist is reduced to being a helpless
bystander while two guys duke it out. You'd think
she'd be elemental in the conflict's resolution, but
the movie makes her a waif.
Shame, because The Deep End's mood is on target. It
has the courage to develop slowly and, right up until
the end, it's careful not to betray its character. The
flip side, of course, is that in a movie this serious
we have to buy the story and, unfortunately, I didn't.
Perhaps the film would have been better off had it not
tried to weave a Hitchcockian plot tapestry and simply
focused on the woman trying to dig her son out of a
hole. It's not pleasant to watch a movie that works so
hard to pull the rug out from under itself.

Review for Doug's 1st Movie (1999)
 Featuring the voice talents of Thomas McHugh, Fred Newman, Chris Phillips,
Constance Shulman, Frank Welker, Doug Preis, Guy Hadley, Alice Playten. Rated
G.
For years, films made for a younger audience have either targeted
preschoolers or older teens. Barring the occasional transcendent animated
Disney feature, the amount of movies made to appeal to, say, a 12-year old.
Disney tries to change all that with Doug's First Movie, a film treatment of
the popular Saturday morning cartoon. The star of both the show and the movie
is Doug, a shy, timid schoolboy who is trying to win the heart of his
life-long crush Patti Mayonnaise in time for the school dance. He is forced
to compete with a cool, sleazy "upper-classman" named Guy. Incidentally, his
best friend Skeeter Valentine discovers a monster in the polluted Lucky-Duck
lake nearby, and now Doug must decide whether to save the monster, who is
being hunted by the trash-happy mayor and his dustbusters, or go after Patti.
I've always been an affectionate fan of the cartoon (please, don't leave!)
because of the neat way it chronicles how an ordinary kid deals with ordinary
problems in extraordinary ways. One of the problems with Doug's First Movie
is that it actually puts its protagonist in a truly unusual situation. I
never expected Doug to concern itself with a friendly monster, it is almost
abominably against the 'toon's very nature, but here we are.
The concept could have worked if it wasn't such a blatant rip-off of E.T. The
Extra Terrestrial, the classic about a boy who befriends a friendly alien.
This is essentially the same movie, except this one is preachy and not nearly
as touching -- or as cute -- as Steven Spielberg's family masterpiece.
The subplots about Doug's girlfriend-to-be and the evil mayor fare better, as
they are more involving and more akin to the tv show's general themes. While
the monster scenario is targeted at the very young people who will inevitably
see this movie, the other plots are out there for the preteens who should
have the most fun with Doug's First Movie. The film is too bland for the
4-year olds who will be disappointed at the non-flashy, sub-par animation and
the unfamiliar to them get-the-girl sub-plot. But 12-year olds might enjoy
this immensely because they are the group that it speaks to, if any.
Still, there are oodles of toons out there that are far superior to this
dull, unexceptional effort from Disney's animation. Doug's First Movie was
originally slated for straight-to-video release, but got a shot at the
multiplexes after the success of The Rugrats Movie. Unfortunately, on video
is where this belongs, and it would be much more passable as a rental. Unless
you have a 12-year old who is a fan of the show, there is simply no reason to
spend money on a film which is so unimpressive when compared to the string of
stellar animation that we have seen come out of the studios these past few
years.
Doug's First Movie is not as intelligence insulting as Quest for Camelot but
it's not nearly as good as The Rugrats Movie. It doesn't feel like an event
that belongs on the big screen. Also, Doug's First Movie decides to outright
preach (a no-no Rugrats avoided), which is decidedly un-Dougish.
Although I smiled and even chuckled at some of the jokes in this picture
(especially a VR gag that's "just like being in this living room... only much
more expensive), this does not amuse an adult; it may even torture a few. My
advice is to see this film only in case of extenuating circumstances.
Otherwise, wait for it to show up on those trusty video shelves.

Review for Mononoke Hime (1997)
 Featuring the voice talents of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian
Anderson, Minnie Driver, Billy Bob Thornton. Rated PG-13.
Princess Mononoke, the latest Japanese anime export from the legendary
Hayao Miyazaki (Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbor Totoro) is neither
a bad film nor the masterpiece so many are making it out to be (Roger
Ebert, why have you forsaken us?). It's a fantasy adventure that has
the frame of a deep, complex back story but never bothers to elaborate
on it, give it anything more than pseudo-substance. It's impressive
animation and fluid action sequences make it more than a passable two
plus hours, but it never becomes the great achievement it could -- and
perhaps should -- have been.
It begins with an enigmatic voiceover that introduces us to a "land of
gods and demons" but doesn't go any further. We are immediately taken
to the outskirts of a Japanese village, where young Ashitaka is
gathering his people because the wise woman has called everyone back to
the village: something evil's afoot. Riding along on his faithful elk
(!), Ashitaka finally spots the cause of all the commotion: a fierce-
looking demon covered in what seems like creepy-crawly worms. The thing
gives chase but Ashitaka manages to escape, unscathed except for a
wound on his arm where the creature touched him. When he gets back to
his village the wise woman (what the hell is a wise woman, anyway?)
tells him some grim news. Apparently, the wound on his arm is actually
a curse, one that nobody knows how to take off. It will eventually
spread all over his body and kill him; in the meantime, he must leave
the village, go to the forests of the wests and search for a cure. This
is his fate: someting he could not escape even if he wanted to.
So Ashitaka sets off and rides westward until he comes across Irontown;
a mysterious and remote human settlement smack in the middle of the
land that the gods and demons revere. The town is ruled by the
discreetly malevolent Lady Eboshi, who's at odds with the gods (and I'm
a poet and I didn't even know it) because of the forest she is
occupying and destroying. As Ashitaka soon finds out, actually, Eboshi
and the rest of her town are planning an all-out war on the gods of the
forest (who, incidentally, take the form of wolves, boars and apes) for
control of the forestg.
Ashitaka develops an affection for San a.k.a. the Princess Mononoke
(translation: the wolf princess; could we be any more subtle here,
folks?), a young girl raised by the wolf gods in a fashion that recalls
all too vividly a certain story by Ridyard Kipling. She is obviously
not about to side with the rest of the humans. Neither is he, but nor
is he ready to completely abandon his race. His intention is to try to
reach a happy medium: the character is nobility epitomized.
Well, the pictures sure are pretty: striking and rich in detail,
utilizing the distinctive anime style to good effect. Indeed, I can't
see the story working in standard Disney-style animation: it just
doesn't seem right, perhaps because we're not accustomed to seeing
serious stories presented in traditional animation. Then again, this
isn't even a very serious movie, but it sure does pretend to be.
There's a lot of dark mythology involved here, but it isn't sincere
mythology, just something made up as a backbone, something to hold the
movie together. There's not much more to it than a skeleton; the
stories are shallow, barren. I'd be in favor of increasing the film's
already lengthy running time in order to deepen the background.
I was never really bored, though my mind started to wander in parts.
Fortunately the film gets its act together for a compelling climax,
which is far and away the best part of the movie. There, it pulls
through not because of our emotional involvement in the story but
because of the visceral thrill it generates: the riveting score,
gorgeous animation and able direction finally manage to give the viewer
a rush, though by then it may be too little, too late. Then again, for
some people, maybe not.
Ultimately, the movie settles in your head rather than in your heart.
There are enough action set pieces and compelling visuals dispersed
throughout to keep you awake and interested but not enough depth to the
story to elicit a real emotional response. Too bad.

Review for O (2001)
"All my life, I've always wanted to fly."
Starring Josh Hartnett, Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles,
Andrew Keegan, Elden Henson, Martin Sheen. Directed by
Tim Blake Nelson. Rated R.
Shakespeare has been subjected to numerous so-called
"adaptations" in recent years. They usually go
something like this: a screenwriter takes the
storyline from one of the Bard's plays, sticks it in a
modern setting, fills it with teenybobber stars, and
finds some way for it to be set in a high school. 10
Things I Hate About You skewered The Taming of the
Shrew and Get Over It tinkered with A Midsummer
Night's Dream for its own nefarious ends. O, directed
by Tim Blake Nelson, was actually filmed before both
of these, but was delayed after the Columbine
shootings made Miramax apprehensive about releasing an
Othello with teenagers. All the hubbub is misleading:
the violence that punctuates the film isn't graphic or
gratuitous, and the movie doesn't exploit
Shakespeare's play but demonstrates its startling
relevance.
Othello is now Odin (Mekhi Phifer), the star
basketball player of a rich, secluded prep school
(also the only black kid in said school), where the
students have apartments and friendship can quickly
turn into politics. He is given a prestigious award by
the riled-up coach (Martin Sheen), and promptly shares
it with his friend, colleague, and co-star, Michael
(Cassio; Andrew Keegan). This casts a long shadow on
second-rate player Hugo (a pre-Pearl Harbor Josh
Hartnett), who is jealous that the coach - his father
- showers attention on Odin and Michael while he is
left wholly out of the spotlight.
So Hugo - playing the part of Iago, of course - sets
out to ruin Odin and get rid of Michael in the
process. He enlists Roger (a.k.a. Roderigo), a
bullied, insecure young man, to make it look like
Odin's girlfriend Desi (Desdemona; Julia Stiles) is
fooling around with Michael on the side. What follows
is known to everyone who has read the play: trappings,
misunderstandings and sinister plots eventually drive
O very nearly insane, culminating in a climax of
characteristic Shakespearean violence.
O has the conviction to stick very close to Othello's
original story in the face of inevitable objections to
the way it plays when brought into present day. I can
envision this happening; if not in a high school, then
definitely at a university, where athletic competition
reaches an absurd level. Remarkably, I can't remember
any moments that seemed glaringly phony; if the
business about the handkerchief seemed a bit trivial,
it was kind of silly in Shakespeare's setting as well.
Nor does the film wimp out at the end; the stabbings
turn into shootings, and the strangling takes place as
you would expect. The build-up to the climax is so
strong, that even though we expect the murders, the
sudden turn to violence is still jarring. The ending
provides no closure or comfort; no pat justification
for what took place to settle everything nicely in the
viewer's mind. Like in the best films, and the best
plays, we are forced to figure it out for ourselves.
Or maybe there's nothing to figure out. An
undercurrent in the film seems to be that this is the
natural course of human events, slightly exaggerated:
competition creates jealousy, jealousy escalates and
turns into malice, which becomes violence. It's a
chilling sentiment, but a daring one.
Josh Hartnett is especially strong in a film filled
with good performances; he needs to take more edgy
projects like this and less autopilot blockbusters
like Pearl Harbor. I also liked Elden Henson as Roger,
a role that carries real emotional weight and
emphasizes sides of the character that were ignored or
subdued in Othello. Director Tim Blake Nelson, himself
an actor (you may remember him as one of George
Clooney's dimwitted companions in O Brother, Where Art
Thou?), knew how to handle his youthful cast, though
Julia Stiles looked somewhat uncomfortable.
O is about teens but, like Ghost World, it is not a
"teen movie." It is a powerful film, and a real one,
making the case that even without the Olde English,
Shakespeare's plots don't go stale. 


Title
Review for Girl, Interrupted (1999)
Starring Winona Ryder, Angelina Jolie, Clea DuVall, Whoopi Goldberg,
Vanessa Redgrave. Directed by James Mangold. Rated R.
I'm usually quite wary of resorting to clichés, but one is quite
appropriate in this case: Girl, Interrupted really is a One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest for the younger generation. It's almost uncanny. But
even as such, it works. Reversing the gender focus and updating the
general storyline, it's an entertaining experience, though it doesn't
pack the emotional wallop of the Milos Forman/Jack Nicholson
collaboration. Sometimes it's trite, sometimes it's preposterously
overblown, but the performances of Winona Ryder and major awards
contender Angelina Jolie pull you through it.
Ryder plays Susanna, a deeply troubled high school senior who is
admitted to Claymoore, an upscale mental institution after she downs a
bottle of aspirin followed by a bottle of vodka. Though she claims she
wasn't trying to commit suicide ("I had a headache!"), her parents
insist that she gets help. So off to Claymoore she goes, predictably
finding herself to be the only remotely "sane" one there.
Susanna forms a peculiar friendship with Lisa (Angelina Jolie), a
psycho with a soft side. They and some other girls sneak off to a
hidden room at night for some female bonding, as well as to the head
psychiatrist office to secretly look at their patient profiles. Lisa
furiously rebels against the system every chance she gets, from slyly
eluding having to swallow her pills to running off from the hospital.
Since Susanna took to Lisa quite well, she tags along with Lisa on some
of her escapades, getting herself into some trouble along the way.
The movie makes a big deal about its title in the beginning, but by the
end it's still unclear how Susanna is a "girl interrupted." But no
matter. This isn't a particularly profound meditation on the human
spirit confined in a mental institution anyway. The scenes in the
hospital generate audience sympathy in precisely the way you'd expect
them to. It's manipulative, yes, but it's also well made, turning a
potentially shameless sap-fest into enjoyable fluff.
The movie works well because Susanna herself is such an engaging
personality. When head nurse Whoopi Goldberg throws her into a bathtub
and tells her that she is letting her life waste away in that damn
hospital, we believe that she is telling the gospel truth. We see
Susanna as an impressionable young woman; putting up the facade of a
rebel but a faithful follower on the inside. Her doctors and parents
tell her that she is crazy, so she believes she must be. She never
makes an attempt to legitimately get herself out of a mental
institution. Instead, she blindly follows the clearly disturbed Lisa
down a path that could never in a million years lead to any good.
The clincher is the lead actresses. Though Ryder gives a great, subdued
performance as (I guess) the title character, she's clearly going to be
upstaged by co-star Jolie's much flashier turn as Ryder's spunky
friend. I agree that Jolie was spectacular; definitely more noticeable
than Winona's. Her performance jumps off the screen while Winona's
stays there humbly. It surprises me, however, how the lead actress,
without whom there would be no movie, turns in a terrific piece of
acting and yet gets ignored. It reminds me of Shakespeare in Love,
which was nominated for every award in every category except for lead
actor Joseph Fiennes who was the life and soul of the film.
Without being particularly deep or, god forbid, ponderous, Girl,
Interrupted engages the mind. Although its ultimate point never really
becomes clear, it's an interesting little movie while it lasts.

Title
Review for Curse of the Jade Scorpion, The (2001)
Starring Woody Allen, Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Brian
Markenson, Wallace Shawn, David Ogden Stiers,
Elizabeth Berkeley, Charlize Theron. Directed by Woody
Allen. Rated PG.
There may have been a time when Woody Allen was a
formidable auteur, but I do not remember it. With his
last two films in particular, he has gone back to the
strategy that propelled Manhattan Murder Mystery:
shrimpy, arrogant, ultra-neurotic protagonist
inadvertently gets himself in [insert predicament] way
over his head. The formula is appealingly simple, and
Allen's ear for distinctive old-codger dialogue as
well as his equally distinctive acting usually lets
him emerge from his often meandering scripts unharmed.
In The Curse of the Jade Scorpion, however, he takes a
few bruises.
Here, Allen plays CW Briggs, an old, old-fashioned,
successful, insurance investigator in the 1940s who
feels threatened by the arrival of the ironically
named Betty Ann (Helen Hunt), a smart, confident
"efficiency expert" who promised boss Chris Magruder
(Dan Aykroyd) to streamline company operations. The
two have a bantering hatred that is required by films
like this to imply a match made in heaven.
One night, at a company shindig, CW and Betty Ann are
pulled on stage to be guinea pigs for a professional
hypnotist. He gives them both key words --
"Constantinople" and "Madagascar," respectively --
that, when uttered, will put them into a deep trance
and make them malleable to instructions. He makes them
pretend that they are honeymooners madly in love with
each other, to the delight of all present. Later, CW
receives a phone call that begins with
"Constantinople," and ends with instructions to steal
the priceless jewels of the Kensington family as only
he can, since his company set up the security system
that protects them.
It doesn't take a CW Briggs to figure out what happens
next. Briggs, who has no idea what he has done, is put
on the case even as evidence mounts against him. He
confides in Betty Ann and seeks help, and then she
herself is forced to criminal action. Part of the fun
is the film's structure: the villain, after his
introduction, is present only as a sinister voice over
the telelphone (though we do see him as he speaks),
and no other character knows what the hell is going
on. This is mass confusion, very skillfully done.
Some people watch Woody Allen movies solely for the
banter between his characters, and The Curse of the
Jade Scorpion has one-liners aplenty. I especially
liked it when CW bursts into a bewildered Betty Ann's
room waving his arms and yelling "Resist the
temptation to scream!" And who can forget the
priceless "When the light hits you a certain way, you
sort of resemble Mussolini."
Still, you can't help but feel a sense of deja vu.
Allen's plots are so slight that his films play like
comic book issues, with the same irrepressible
character being placed in different situations. I
think he needs a new angle; Jade Scorpion is always
tolerable, and sometimes even more than that, but the
formula won't be able to withstand a new installment.
Oh, and Helen Hunt is amazing, as usual. I maintain
that there is nothing this woman can't do (except save
What Women Want. Neither Woody Allen nor his character
is a match.

Title
Review for Last Night (1998)
Starring Don McKellar, Sandra Oh, David Cronenberg. Directed by Don
McKellar. Rated R.
The end of the world is here, but in Canadian director Don McKellar's
feature debut Last Night, there are no Satans, no comets, no astronauts
and no heroes (well, in the traditional sense of the word). It's a
thoughtful, affecting film, one that pulls no punches and plays no
tricks. This isn't an f/x production and those expecting action would
do well to stay away; this is for those who would like a quiet
apocalyptic vision for a change. This is not about the end of the world
as a concept -- we never find out why the world is ending or how
everyone knows it's ending -- but about how real, normal people deal
with it and what they do in the last six hours of their lives.
McKellar, who wrote The Red Violin for François Girard, casts himself
here as Patrick Wheeler, an average, reasonably happy man (though his
previous wife died of cancer) who has decided that he wants to spend
his last six hours at home alone, quietly. His parents are pissy that
he doesn't want to spend the time with his family -- but family dinners
can be boring even on the last day of your life, and Patrick has no
intention of putting himself through it. He is adamant that these hours
will be his.
But along comes Sandra (Sandra Oh), who has lost her car to doomsday
raiders (read: those who want to take advantage of the apocalypse to
commit no-consequence crimes, thereby letting their anger out) and is
looking for her husband, who seems to have disappeared. She comes to
Patrick's door in desperation, begging to use his phone, not knowing
where else to go. He reluctantly lets her in. Her husband doesn't
answer. They start talking. Patrick soon finds out why she is so
desperate to find her husband and what is in that mysterious case she
is carrying: she and her hubby made a pact to shoot each other right
before the world ends.
In a seemingly unrelated plot line, a gas company employee spends his
last hours calling each of his customers assuring them that he
will "make every effort to keep their gas flowing right up until the
end." Patrick's friend wants to realize every sexual fantasy he's ever
had -- including, but certainly not limited to sex with his teacher and
sex with another man (he propositions Patrick). Meanwhile, those who
decided to party their brains out on the last day, party on.
Last Night has more than its share of humor and it's even being
marketed as half-comedic, when in fact, it epitomizes poignancy. This
lies in the characters. David Cronenberg's gas company employee is one
of the year's saddest, most touching characters; even more impressive
considering how little screen time he was granted. Sandra Oh's Sandra
is devastating as a woman who refuses to let the world take her life.
Patrick seems to be the only content character on screen, but even he
has undertones of sadness. The movie isn't a weep-fest or a melodrama
because it's too good for either genre and because it ends with a
decisive touch of hope and redemption.
The sex-fantasy subplot may be a bit too "out there" for a film
otherwise so subdued that even I felt like screaming "BIG BANG!" at the
screen sometimes. But it tends to balance out well and I can't call the
film uneven. Actually, it's quite the opposite: most of the movie is
hypnotic in its relentless stability and calmness. The antidote to End
of Days, Last Night is the patient person's Armageddon.
The key to the movie is that we don't know how or why the world is
ending. The only information we are given is that for the past few
weeks (months?), the sun has stayed up 24/7, the cell phones haven't
worked and the government has closed up shop. No explanation is ever
provided. This maybe frustrating to some -- even I admit to wanting
something concrete at points -- but it is the reason this movie
succeeds. Providing an answer to logistical questions would have
diverted attention from the movie's main focus, which is hardly the end
of the world in and of itself.
McKellar's directorial debut is entertaining, deeply moving, dignified
and the all-important ending is just perfect. Seeing Last Night the
same week as End of Days made me realize how important it is to be able
to see films produced outside of the American Hollywood movie-mill,
especially those from north of the border.

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
"Not far from here there's a fence. On the other side of the fence is
freedom. That gorilla will never try to get to it."
Starring Anthony Hopkins, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Sutherland, Maura
Tierney. Rated R.
Instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will
undoubtedly label as "powerful" or "touching". I have a name for it
myself: "gross". This is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a
bully, the bully looks at the "rebel" threateningly, about to hurt him,
and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands
up too. How that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls
me: aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "inspired" by something
like that? This is one example (there are actually some more in
Instinct alone) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence.
Instinct's plot is brimming with potential: World-renowned
anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) disappeared for two years
whilst doing research in the jungles of Africa. He was found and is
coming back to the United States a convicted killer; he murdered to
African policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him. After
committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport, the
authorities stick him in a prison's "psychotics ward". Assigned to do
an evaluation on Powell is a bright (or so we are told) young
psychiatrist Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.).
Caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of
furthering his career. Of course (and no mainstream filmmaker would
ever have it any other way) he starts really caring for Powell and he
becomes fixed on helping Powell prove that he is not a psychotic and
that he should not be in prison. And then there's the inevitable
"heartless meanie" character, in the form of Donald Sutherland who
plays Caulder's mentor. He cares for Caulder but does everything he can
to discourage him from helping Powell.
Let's get one thing straight: Dr. Theo Caulder is the most blatantly
incompetent psychiatrist I have ever seen, on screen or off. Any good
shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject
because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that
way. Not good old Theo. No, he asks purposefully pointed questions and
when Powell dares to venture to another subject Caulder says "We need
to talk about this right now." This is a flaw only in the sense that it
detracts from Instinct's already dubious credibility; unfortunately
it's also the least of its problems.
Director Jon Turteltaub, who made the delightful John Travolta vehicle
Phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par Cool Runnings decided
to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that, contrary to what
this movie's promotion would have you believe, it has much more in
common with Patch Adams than with The Silence of the Lambs. It's not
the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes
(What Dreams May Come aptly demonstrated that) but the kind that brings
vomit up your esophagus (excuse the graphic depiction). It aims to
"inspire" rather than to touch hearts. As Yoda would say, inspire it
does not.
It is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter (the very
experienced Gerald Di Pego) has to resort to literally telling the
audience a movie's story. Indeed, somewhere in the beginning of
Instinct, one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to
another character. This, like the instance I mentioned in the first
paragraph of this review, is a horrid insult to our intelligence. I am
forced to wonder whether Turteltaub and Di Pego did not think that we
could figure out what Instinct is about simply from regular
conversation.
I think that Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors, and
he chews the scenery in this movie, brilliant as ever. Oscar winner
Cuba Gooding Jr. on the other hand is dreadful. His performance is at
least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a
shrink. I liked the guy in Jerry Maguire as well as in As Good as it
Gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real
feeling.
I love animals, and Instinct's prominent Save The Gorillas/Live in
Harmony With Nature theme is certainly something I could sympathize
with. However this movie's execution is completely unacceptable. Tone
down the violence and this will be a chick flick.

Review for Fight Club (1999)
Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter. Rated R.
Pre-release buzz is not directly proportionate to film quality. Take
two recent films, for example: The Blair Witch Project and Fight Club.
Both were hyped tremendously; the former was touted as the scariest
film of all time while the latter was supposedly a sure-fire Oscar
contender. Well, all I can say is no frickin' way. Blair Witch,
contrary to what some cretins claimed, was barely even creepy and Fight
Club, well...
It is exceedingly difficult to give a brief synopsis of the plot, which
is busy and convoluted, becoming less and less linear as it rambles
along. I'll wind up describing it in detail, so if you don't want that
much information you might as well skip the next three paragraphs.
Consider yourself warned. Ś For those of y'all who have decided to
remain for my makeshift plot description, listen carefully. We meet
Jack (Edward Norton), the man who is to guide us through the rest of
the movie. Jack is a troubled soul, an insomniac who takes solace in
going to support groups he doesn't belong to, just so he can cry and
get his true feelings out. He is hampered by his soul-deadening job and
joyless existence; he spends his free time trying to figure out which
piece of Ikea merchandise defines him as a person.
Everything changes in one weird day. On a plane he meets Tyler Durden
(Brad Pitt), an angry-at-the-world soap salesman who leaves an
impression on him. When he returns to his condo, he finds that it has
exploded. How no one seems to know. For some reason, he calls up Tyler,
who agrees to let Jack stay with him at his old, beaten-up shack of a
home. In the parking lot one day, Tyler encourages Jack to hit him as
hard as he can. This leads to a fight. Before Jack knows it, he and
Tyler have started an underground fight club, in which men like Jack
(i.e. opressed by society) can take their anger out by kicking the crap
out of others. Jack and Tyler make up rules, homework assignments and
the like and their endeavor becomes unexpectedly popular, with
franchises reportedly starting up all over the country.
Before long, the fight club turns into "Project Mayhem," a sinister
organization of brainwashed drones all working toward a secret goal
unknown to Jack. Jack wants out, but is he in too deep?
My main problem with Fight Club is that its mood and screenplay suggest
an important film with something socially significant to say when in
reality it's paper-thin stuff. It's alleged message about men following
their primal instincts crumbles and falls apart when subjected to the
slightest of scrutiny. In fact, what this film tries to say is
prepostrous: men are "womanized" by Ikea and office work and respond by
releasing their suppresed anger in the form of violence. Is the movie
glorifying this?
Just because the film is hollow doesn't mean it's bad. But to be
worthwhile without being significant means that it has to be a viable
thriller. It's a diverting one because of its offbeat tone and pacing,
but it isn't good. Plot elements make no sense, especially when the
film's big secret is revealed. There is a similarity to The Sixth Sense
in the surprise ending, but that film made it work because it remained
consistent while Fight Club's ending does nothing but create plot holes
big enough to drive a Zamboni through.
One thing I can wholeheartedly praise in Fight Club is the
performances, which are outstanding. Edward Norton once again proves
his ability to mold into any role given to him. Brad Pitt, at last, has
the opportunity to impress us and he capitalizes. I've never liked the
actor; I always thought that he made his characters dull and
uninteresting with his mannerisms. Here, he is effectively menacing in
a bizarre role, clearly trying to make the most of a chance to revive
his lackluster career (he hasn't had a hit since Se7en).
This is an engrossing, entertaining movie, original, visually kinetic
and viscerally exciting. But you can show me as many weird and creative
styles and ideas as you want, if you have nothing to say you result
remains nothing more than a cheeky game, a piece of subversive nothing.

Review for Foolish (1999)
Starring Eddie Griffin, Master P. Rated R.
What would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a
movie? A better question, what would inspire a studio to produce said movie?
If you have an answer, let me know. Foolish, the new movie written by and
starring Master P is a jaw-droppingly horrible film, one with no redeeming
value socially, cinematically or otherwise. Comedically it has some
potential, but only in its stand-up comedy moments, which I can turn on
Comedy Central for.
Master P stars as Fifty Dollah' (beat that!) as a mobster (I think) who is
trying to start a comedy club/act with his little brother Foolish (Eddie
Griffin). But the two of them have to deal with an angry mob boss (played by
Andrew Dice Clay, for the very first time entertaining), a stubborn club
owner and family problems (the latter in Foolish is a perfect example of
Roger Ebert's "Idiot Plot," if everyone here wasn't an idiot, there would be
no problem)
So what does Foolish have to offer beside a bunch of idiotic character names?
Not a hell of a lot. As I have mentioned, Master P cannot act or write. He
acts like the rapper that he is. The occasional despair that his script
requires him to exhibit is excruciatingly forced, as are his warm and fuzzy
scenes with his little bro. As for his script -- well, I suppose he delivers
what one would expect from a musical artist with no previous screenwriting
experience. If you haven't yet figured it out, that is not saying much.
Co-star Eddie Griffin (really the star of the show) is quite a different
story. The fact of the matter is that Griffin, whose most significant screen
outing to date is probably the mildly successful tv show Malcolm and Eddie on
the fledgling UPN network, is an extremely talented comedian, stand-up and
otherwise. He has much in common with Chris Tucker (Rush Hour, Money Talks)
in how quickly and effortlessly his speech flows from his lips. He spouts
profanity with impressive dexterity (to the extent which that can be done),
and while I hope that does not become his trademark it works in a few scenes
in this movie.
And indeed, I laughed at a few stand-up scenes here, but from a
feature-length movie I expect more. Foolish provided me with no reason to
care for these characters. Every scene which has any potential for dramatic
impact is effectively diffused by either a stupid joke (in a scene where
tension escalates between the two brothers, Foolish blurts out towards his
jewelry-sporting sibling "You lay one hand on me and this cemetary is going
to be a gold rush") or something even more idiotic such as Foolish smashing
his own car (to which I said, a bit too loudly for the occasion "Huh?") after
getting slightly upset with his wife.
Believe me when I say that there is nothing in Foolish that warrants parting
with your hard-earned $8. You'll get more laughs from watching 30 minutes of
Comedy Central or any virtually any sitcom if you don't have cable. Eddie
Griffin fans may enjoy this derivative (although offensive) yarn, but everyone
else should stay the hell away.

Title
Review for Gladiator (2000)
Starring Russel Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed,
Djimon Hounsou. Rated R
It must have been a hell of a gamble. Making a $100 million Roman epic,
the likes of which we haven't seen in decades, with no automatic-draw
stars and few merchandising opportunities is hardly a sure bet but one
that seems to be paying off mightily. Gladiator, a breathtaking trip
through the 180 A.D. Roman Empire, is a rarity: an unabashedly
grandiose production with one major priority: entertainment. If there
is any subtext or moral in the film, it is purely secondary. This is a
big, all-stops-out blockbuster and it delivers.
The film opens with a battle scene rivaling the notorious invasion
sequence at the beginning of Saving Private Ryan in scope. Maximus
(Russel Crowe) is a general leading great Roman Emperor Marcus
Aurelius's army in a fight to put down a widespread rebellion. The
cunning Maximus wins easily. After the battle, Aurelius calls Maximus
into his chambers. Knowing that his time on Earth is coming to an end,
the old Emperor gives the throne to Maximus. The two are not related,
but they love each other like brothers and Aurelius truly believes that
this general will do the best job as ruler of the vast empire.
The news doesn't please Aurelius's son Commodus (the unrecognizable
Joaquin Phoenix). The corrupt, power-hungry prince is outraged at his
father's betrayal and kills him before he can officially announce his
successor. He then sends Maximus off to be executed. Unbeknownst to
Commodus, Maximus escapes but thinking that he is dead, Commodus kills
his family. After finding this out, the injured Maximus collapses on
the ground. He is discovered by slave traders and sold to Proximo
(Oliver Reed), an organizer of gladiator matches.
So Maximus is forced to participate in these cruel, lurid battles to
the death. He quickly wins over the audience and becomes the most
popular gladiator around. When the action unexpectedly shifts from a
small "suburban" arena to the big kahuna itself -- the Collosseum in
Rome -- a showdown between Maximus and the corrupt Commodus, against
whom Maximus has vowed revenge, seems inevitable. Commodus's sister
(Connie Nielsen) offers Maximus her services in helping destroy her
malevolent brother.
Ridley Scott, bless his soul, is an extremely skilled technical and
visual director and he knows exactly what he is doing. The
aforementioned opening scene is heartstopping: fast and furious but
also riveting and suspenseful. There is so much going on but Scott
presents it so well that not only do we understand what's going on but
our eyes are glued to the screen. It's an excellent hook, grabbing my
attention from the word go.
In later scenes, Scott shows a penchant for taking bloody, often
gruesome scenes and turning them into crowdpleasers. This may not be
the most moral approach to a film like this, but damned if it wasn't
fun -- and when Crowe, after brutally dismembering a rival, asks the
cheering stadium audience if they've been entertained, we feel a quick
twinge of shame because we realize that we've just been entertained by
the exact same thing. Gladiator somehow strikes a balance, keeping the
moralizing minimal enough so that we can still enjoy the rest of the
action and not feel too guilty about it. This is a movie that has its
priorities straight.
Russel Crowe, undergoing an unbelievable transformation from a chunky
tobacco Insider to a beefy Gladiator, is quickly proving himself to be
an amazingly versatile actor. There is not a trace here of the Russel
Crowe we've seen before. It's a whole new role and it seems like a
whole new actor. I could hardly believe my eyes.
Joaquin Phoenix, too, is utterly convincing as the villain: his
Commodus is powerful and formidable on the outside but always with an
undertone of weakness and helplessness. As the bad guy, he's easy to
hate but we feel a little sorry for the guy, too. It's obvious that he
got himself in way over his head, he just doesn't know it.
The script, by David Franzoni (Amistad) and John Logan (Bats, believe
it or not) is not completely without flaws. The ending seems too eager
to set up a grandiose showdown between the protagonist and the villain
and is also the only major historical inaccuracy in ways I won't
reveal. It has the intended emotional effect on the audience, but
looking back it's probably the only part of the film which I found
implausible. It works a bit too hard, contrives a little too much to
get a strong reaction.
Gladiator presents us with a man forced to be a superhero. He wants to
avenge his family's wrongful death and in the process kills a lot of
people and becomes famous throughout Rome. Kids idolize him, crowds
worship him and why? Because he can kill. And don't we look for
characters who can kill when we choose which summer blockbuster to see?
Gladiator's biggest achievment is that it doesn't put a guilt trip on
us. It's tremendously entertaining but not hypocritical. You can take
or leave the message. For many, I'm sure, the movie will just be a
rollicking good time. And that's okay.

Title
Review for Entrapment (1999)
 Starring Sean Connery, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Ving Rhames. Rated PG-13.
There are some pairs of actors and actresses that can light up the screen
when they are together. Can you recall how well Jack Lemmon and Walter
Matthau mixed before they degraded to the likes of such travesties as The Odd
Couple 2? Remember how luminous a screen pair Julia Roberts and Rupert
Everett were in My Best Friend's Wedding? If movie stars have chemistry they
can do wonders for a film, and there is no better example than the terrific
action thriller Entrapment, in which the show belongs to the aging Sean
Connery and the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones.
Entrapment is a tricky little movie that stars Jones as Gin, an unusually
agile insurance agent who has plans to track down and capture a notorious art
thief named Robert MacDougal. She plans to accomplish this by presenting
herself to him another thief and give him an opportunity to steal an ancient
Chinese mask worth a reported $40 million dollars. Evidently he trusts her --
but not before stealing a few microchips worth millions and threaten to frame
her if she betrays him.
Ving Rhames, one of my favorite actors, has a minor, although deceptive role
in the movie, but it is not minor enough to dissappoint; it is so
underwritten that Rhames is not given the opportunity to inject his trademark
charisma into the script. The rest of the cast fares far better: as a matter
of fact, Connery and Jones shine. Despite their fairly obvious age
difference, the two seem to be made for each other and the script made just
for them. It is always a virtue for an otherwise inconsistent film for its
stars to invariably grab our attention.
Although Entrapment is always fun, sometimes outrageously exciting, sometimes
wickedly tricky and sometimes intriguing in human aspects of the story, much
of the plot and continuity will not stand to close scrutiny. To wit,
essential plausibility is often sacrificed for the sake of showing us
something cool. Sometimes it is but sometimes it just makes so little sense
that it undermines the flow of the movie.
On the bright side, although the movie does feature its share of nifty
high-tech gadgets, director Jon Amiel (Copycat, The Man Who Knew Too Little)
for the most part avoids utilizing those gadgets to neatly rescue his
characters when they back themselves into a corner. So many James Bond-type
thrillers do that, and it's often times frustrating because it usually
demonstrates a lack of creativity on the part of the filmmakers.
Of course movies about thieves, deceptions and lies of all sorts have to have
some sort of surprise at the end, but Entrapment does this interestingly. The
movie drops all sorts of clues to the movie's big secret -- even some that are
blatantly obvious, but you don't realize how obvious they were until after the
secret is revealed. It's refreshing to see a film that plays fair with it's
audience; there is nothing that it throws at you that the perceptive viewer
couldn't have suspected.
There's a difference between this and predictability. If the film were to be
predictable, Amiel and his screenwriters would've had to have done their best
to conceal their trick from you but blunder so that you were able to guess
it. But here, they purposely and seemingly subtly give you a chance to figure
out what's going on before coming right out and saying it at the end. When
this method succeeds it's not predictability.
Entrapment is an engrossing, fun, effective thriller that triumphs despite its
continuity errors. It works because of its stars, because of its smarts and
because of its deftess in bringing a script to throbbing, pulsating life.

Review for Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001)
Featuring the voice talents of Michael J. Fox, James
Garner, Cree Summer, Don Novello, Claudia Christian,
Phil Morris, Jacqueline Obradors, Florence Stanley,
Jim Varney, John Mahoney, Leonard Nimoy, Corey Burton,
David Ogden Stiers. Directed by Gary Troudsdale and
Kirk Wise. Rated PG.
I support Disney's efforts to move away from their
traditional "Broadway musical" formula for making
animated features. Though some great films emerged
from the Disney showtunes era, the format is tired,
and the latest installments have been weak. Last
year's The Emperor's New Groove was a huge step
forward. Atlantis: The Lost Empire is a step back.
Apparently, the animators were looking to place an
emphasis on story this time around, and they failed.
The movie earns points for making its protagonist a
linguist, of all things. Disney also reportedly hired
a real-life linguist to make up a language for the
Atlanteans, but more on that later. Michael J. Fox,
who, since beginning his fight with Parkinson's
disease, has become voice artist extraordinaire, plays
Milo, the scientist in question. He has dedicated his
career at a museum of natural history to discovering
the lost continent of Atlantis. His superiors have
rebuked his efforts, dismissing his obsession as a
hopeless flight of fancy.
Little did Milo know that his father, also a
researcher dedicated to finding Atlantis, discovered
an ancient book that explains how to find it. He left
this book to an old friend of his, who has already
booked a state of the art expedition to the fabled
underwater continent, and saved Milo a seat.
So Milo and a motley crew of military officers,
pilots, diggers and demolitionists, take off in a
bizarre-looking submarine to look for Atlantis. As the
advertising not-so-subtly suggests, they find it, and
find also that its ancient society has survived to
this day. But Milo's companions aren't interested in
studying these people; they want to steal the Heart of
Atlantis, the industrial-sized diamond that is the
continent's life force, and leave the inhabitants to
die.
Disney has ditched most of the extraneous elements
here; there are no funny sidekicks, no cute animals,
no musical numbers. It's all about story, folks. The
problem is that the story is weak, possibly even more
so than "ordinary" Disney features. The movie puts in
some strictly surface-level mythology to justify the
bizarre supernatural proceedings (the film has been
compared with Japanese anime, but even the weakest
entry in that genre has more guts than Atlantis) and
then bases its climax on the entirely illogical
presumption that the gang of profiteers would take the
trouble to destroy the continent before leaving with
the loot.
You can't have it both ways. A Disney movie must
either have the distractions that the filmmakers tried
so hard to purge or it must have a solid storyline
that stands on its own merits. If anything, Atlantis
won't be notable in 10 years as a new Disney
rennaissance a lá The Little Mermaid, but as the last
stand of tranditional cel animation against the
newfangled CGI that seems to be taking over the genre.
And while the graphics here are impressive, they
amount to little compared to the likes of Shrek.
With The Emperor's New Groove, the Mouse House proved
that it can still tell a good story and make a
terrifically entertaining production. Atlantis proves
that if you want to tell a story, you need a story.

Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Mike Meyers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Verne Troyer. Rated
PG-13 (but should be R).
When a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy, he always risks
having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like
EDtv and Office Space. It really is too bad that comedies are so hit-
and-miss, because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be
amused, it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver.
But weep not, dear readers, because the latest comedy out of the
Hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet. Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the funniest things I've had the pleasure
to see in a long time; a completely looney, delightful parody of the
often pretentious James Bond flicks. If all comedies (or even half; or -
- what am I saying? -- even a fifth of them) could be this consistently
hysterical, I would take up residence at my local multiplex.
Even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the
1997 sleeper/cult hit Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. The
original came out of nowhere; it was a low-budget, eccentric movie that
many expected to flop like a Leslie Nielsen parody. All of a sudden it
was being quoted by teenagers all over America. Ironically, Powers'
"Yeeeeah baby, yeah!" has almost become an icon of the late 90s.
Thus another installment was inevitable, but it's also undoubtedly
welcome. The Spy Who Shagged Me is one of the most unrestrained, over-
the-top comedies I have ever seen in my entire life. It brings back most
of the characters from its predecessor (even if only briefly) and adds
new ones. Austin Powers (Mike Myers), a swinging hipster from the 60s
transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his
mojo (oh, you'll figure it out), which Dr. Evil (Meyers again) has
stolen. He enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent Felicity Shagwell
(now that his prior sidekick Vanessa has been properly disposed of in a
hilarious opening sequence), played without much distinguishable gusto
by Heather Graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat Dr.
Evil yet again.
Surprisingly, the real star is Dr. Evil rather than Austin. He gets most
of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie. Perhaps
this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately.
Instead of being the scheming, villainous mad scientist we might expect
from a character like this he is a bumbling, often sweet mad scientist
wannabe.
The Spy Who Shagged Me has much of the same stuff we saw in the
original, but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting
more. By the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of
shag jokes, crude puns and Powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our
appetites. Even by its conclusions, I'm still not sure I've had my fill
of bits like "Do you smoke after sex?" "I don't know, baby, I never
looked."
This may seem awfully immature of me, but understand that the Austin
Powers series, unlike most of the crap Hollywood feeds us these days, is
genuinely funny. I don't know if I've ever laughed harder at any movie
than I did during the Jerry Springer send up or the indubitably
hilarious "Just the Two of Us" rendition by Dr. Evil and his new
miniature clone named "Mini-me".
I don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social
satire or anything of the sort. Indeed there is little beyond the joy a
viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as
much as this movie did. But as far as I'm concerned, that is enough.

Review for American Psycho (2000)
American Psycho is technically superb, tantalizingly ambitious, morally
sound and very well acted. And yet I can't, in good conscience,
recommend that people go see it. Though in hindsight the film is an
excellent think piece, I left the theater with a sour taste in my
mouth. I'm a liberal guy, but this movie goes beyond "disturbing" and
gets dangerously close to "repulsive" in its portrayal of senseless
sadistic violence and sexual violence. It's true that American Psycho's
purpose was to jar the viewer but I wonder: should any movie being
passed off as entertainment go this far?
Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is a yuppie living in New York in the
1980's. He's a sleek, efficient businessman, perhaps less cocky than
his friends, who regularly have business card contests (an obvious
symbol for the men's sexual frustration) and have competitions to see
who can get the most difficult restaurant reservations. This is what
the lives of everyone but Bateman consist of. When Bateman himself goes
home, he kills: viciously and for no apparent reason. He also likes to
hire prostitutes and have bizarre, violent sex.
One of Bateman's murders doesn't go over so well. When he kills one of
his co-workers, Paul Allen (Jared Leto), he makes a few mistakes which
send a detective (Willem Dafoe) after him. Though the detective never
makes it clear whether or not he is really on to him or whether he is
simply doing routine questioning, Patrick, for the first time in his
life, becomes a little paranoid and loses his seemingly perpetual cool.
American Psycho has stirred up talk in Hollywood since day 1.
Originally, Leonardo DiCaprio was slated to play Patrick Bateman; when
he bowed out, little-known (though prolific) British actor Bale was
brought in and the budget went down. Then, as the film creeped closer
to completion, new controversy came up. The film got an NC-17 rating
for a graphic mжиnage Я trois scene. Director Mary Harron, at first,
refused to cut a minute of the film but later gave in and edited it for
an R (in my opinion, the film should have still received the NC-17).
The MPAA didn't seem to be particularly concerned about the movie's
violence which is abundant, but not as graphic as you might think.
Still, it was presented so nonchalantly that I was genuinely shocked by
some of it even though I've technically seen more explicit violence in
teen slasher movies. It's all in the attitude. I agree that this was
exactly the film's intention and can only counter with one argument:
the movie made me feel terrible. Movies aren't supposed to do that.
Still, there's a lot to praise in this adaptation of what was widely
regarded as an "unfilmable" novel (unread by me). *MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD*
Mary Harron leaves some things deliberately ambiguous; at the end, she
raises the question of whether these crimes may have been committed in
Bateman's bored, materialistic mind. Consider, for example, the fact
that nobody seems to notice when Bateman kills a half-naked woman with
a noisy chainsaw on an apartment stairway. No one even peeks out of a
door to see what all the ruckus is about. Harron does not emphasize
this but it is hard to believe that she would just forget about it
accidentally. This makes the movie good for debate later if you don't
bolt out of the theater halfway through, like I was very close to doing.
Christian Bale is a wonderful actor, perfectly pulling off the darkly
comedic scenes scattered throughout the movie. It would have been most
amusing to see DiCaprio try it: I don't have an antipathy for the actor
but I don't think he would dare play some of these scenes straight.
Chloe Sevigny, an Oscar nominee for the similarly disturbing but far
less lurid Boys Don't Cry also shows up for a small part as Bateman's
secretary.
Look: this movie didn't warp my mind. I'm not scarred for life because
I saw it. But I can tell you that it made me feel very uncomfortable,
going beyond its intention of throwing the viewer somewhat off-balance.
If that floats your boat, fine. But if you bring a friend, you may be
severely berated afterwards.

Title
Review for Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo (1999)
Starring Rob Schneider, Oded Fehr, Eddie Griffin, William Forsythe, Chi
Chi La Rue. Directed by Mike Mitchell. Rated R.
Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo is so much better than most
of the crap the similarly idiotic, infinitely higher-profile Adam
Sandler has made (with the possible exceptions of The Wedding Singer
and Happy Gilmore) that it's almost tempting to recommend it. And had
the movie been more of a knee-slapper, I might have done just that;
unfortunately, this eminently likeable movie is only mildly amusing.
First-time feature director Mike Mitchell made a decent frame of a
movie -- including a main character that actually develops -- but he
forgets to suffuse his goofball, gross-out comedy with laughs.
The title character (Schneider) is actually a fish-tank cleaner by
trade. One day he gets himself a gig cleaning the expensive fish tank
of the enigmatic and very European Antoine. Deuce soon finds out just
what Antoine does for a living, and nobody describes the occupation
than Antoine himself: "women pay me to give them pleasure." Deuce
responds "I'm gonna kill my guidance counselor!"
Well, Antoine has to go away to Switzerland for six weeks and he
entrusts Deuce with his house and his fishtank (not forgetting the
ominous "you mess up anything and I'll kill you!"). Needless to say, on
his first day on the job, fishtank goes bye-bye thanks to Deuce's
overwhelming curiosity about Antoine's fancy exercise equipment. This
leaves Deuce with six weeks to obtain enough money to replace the tank
and clean up the mondo mess he made. No prizes for guessing Deuce's
cash flow sourse of choice.
Yes -- Deuce gets himself a pimp, played by Eddie Griffin. He hooks
Deuce up with various colorful dates. One is named "Jabba the Slut,"
weighing in at some 600 pounds. Another has Tourette's syndrome and
spouts random obscenities at innocent passers-by. Yet another is
grotesquely tall, with a suspiciously manly voice. We never see the
latter's face. Aside from these freaks of nature -- pleasuring whom is
repulsive but very lucrative -- there is one normal girl, the one Deuce
inevitably falls in love with. Her little secret I dare not reveal,
though you can probably guess it from the trailers.
To my surprise, I really warmed up to Deuce Bigalow the person. Unlike
some of Sandler's subjects, who tend to be meanies, retards or
similarly unlikeable types, Schneider's misbegotten Gigolo has a warm
heart and is not an utter moron. What's more, his character actually
goes someplace, rather than just being used as a tool to elicit cheap
laughs (though there are plenty of those). It's nothing groundbreaking -
- I don't want to over-analyze this feather-light fare or give it more
credit than it deserves -- but by the end of the movie I felt like
Deuce Bigalow was a happier person and I actually cared.
While Deuce Bigalow fulfills the daunting task of inserting likeable
characters into the script, it doesn't quite do it when it comes to
laughs. Aside from a couple hilarious The Matrix parody sequences,
there just isn't much here to incite the kind of fall-off-your-chair
belly laughs the ads seem to promise. I won't say that all the gags
fall flat but none of them are memorable. I laughed or chuckled
intermittently but the movie just wasn't as funny as I was hoping.
After watching Deuce Bigalow, I'm not convinced that Rob Schneider is a
bankable leading man. He's successful here, but before this movie, he
was only known as "the delivery guy in Big Daddy" or "the guy who
shouts 'You can dooooo it!' in The Waterboy". This will streamline his
career, but it is hardly a star-making turn. Schneider is a talented
actor, but he needs something more challenging (sophisticated?) than
this. Adam Sandler (who, by the way, executive produced this) proved
that he wasn't a hack in the sweet, romantic, smart The Wedding Singer.
If Schneider doesn't want to be remembered as "that gigolo" for the
rest of his career, he needs a more significant comedic role.
This is an entertaining diversion, nothing more, nothing less. It's not
exactly riotous but it's more than watchable. Deuce Bigalow is probably
more hit than miss, though not quite a bullseye.

Review for Fast and the Furious, The (2001)
"I live my life a quarter-mile at a time."
Starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez,
Jordana Brewster. Directed by Gary Troudsdale and Kirk
Wise. Rated PG-13.
How do I review a movie like The Fast and the Furious?
It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, which
is provide realistic, exciting car races, chases and
crashes. It does very little more. This presents a
dilemma: do I recommend the film on the basis of that
accomplishment, or do I give it a "thumbs down"
because it accomplishes nothing else? I don't know, so
I'm wimping out and going borderline.
The Fast and the Furious claims to take us inside the
underworld of illegal street racing. Brian (Paul
Walker), is a police officer assigned to expose the
racers and the smuggling ring they might be running
(this is the first movie I've seen where people
actually smuggle DVD players; I'd like to see it in 20
years). Vin Diesel, who came out of nowhere with
Boiler Room last year, plays Dominic, a revered,
respected street lord and racing champion.
Brian has trouble getting in, at first -- Dominic's
cronies start a fight, and he makes a bad impression
on the big guy's sister -- but he enters a race by
betting his new, loaded racecar, loses it, and gains
Dominic's favor. What follows is a predictable battle
of loyalties; will Brian betray Dominic by turning him
in, or will he become a criminal for the sake of his
new friend? We know, of course, that the movie will
somehow find a way to have its cake and eat it, too.
Director Rob Cohen, the Harvard graduate responsible
for The Skulls, last year's worst movie, has made
what's really a niche film (though the current
box-office shows that this is one hell of a niche).
Since it has made so much money, I won't say that it
will only be of interest to certain people, but it
should particularly appeal to car lovers and those who
watch NASCAR in their spare time (I never understood
what was so appealing about watching cars go around in
circles).
Make no mistake, The Fast and the Furious really does
do some neat things with cars. The movie has real
stunts, as opposed to the computer generated crashes
in Renny Harlin's Driven, and the chase and crash
scenes are extraordinarily good-looking. There's
little actual suspense because there's zero interest
in the plot once you get beyond the dubious appeal of
the actors themselves, but the racing -- whee, look
how fast they're going! -- is second to none.
If the filmmakers didn't intend to give up on the
narrative, which it looks like they did, their project
could have benefited from a better leading man; Paul
Walker is such a non-actor that his dull, idiotic
stare is almost funny to watch. Vin Diesel is a
terrific actor in the right role, but this movie
concentrates too much on his noble side and doesn't
let him do what he does best, which is be a badass.
And that's about it. If that doesn't interest you,
don't pay to see this movie. If you do, seek out the
best multiplex in town; I don't understand the
argument that The Fast and the Furious should be seen
at a drive-in with a bad sound system and an
obstructed view, but maybe I'm just too young. This is
a movie to be seen and occasionally heard. If you like
cars, that is.

Review for Drowning Mona (2000)
Starring Bette Midler, Casey Affleck, Danny DeVito, Jamie Lee Curtis,
Neve Campbell, William Fichtner, Marcus Thomas. Directed by Nick Gomez.
Rated PG-13.
Drowning Mona is a weak, underrealized, inconsistent comedy that has
enough little throwaway gags to keep us interested but not much more to
sustain our constant involvement. It's dark, often meanspirited but
it's laughs don't originate in its pitch-black tone. Instead, the few
moments here worth savoring are the goofier, more light-hearted ones.
Does that make the movie a failure? That depends on your tastes.
The film opens with a scruffy-looking Bette Midler getting out of her
trailer to go somewhere. She realizes she doesn't have keys to the
right car, so she is forced to take her son's. As she's riding along
she comes to a hairpin turn that, if not maneuvered around correctly,
can lead to a car plunging into a lake. She slams the breaks, but they
don't work. Down, down to a watery grave.
Via flashbacks we find out that Midler's character, whose name was Mona
Dearly, was not a well-liked lady. She was, in fact, a violent bitch
who delighted in hitting people with frying pans and other blunt
objects when they did the slightest thing to piss her off. This leaves
the town detective (Danny DeVito) with a problem: who cut Mona Dearly's
breaks? Everyone, it seems, had a motive. Was it Mona's husband
(William Fichtner)? Her idiot son (Marcus Thomas)? A mild-mannered (or
is he) young enterpeneur who's had his share of encounters with Mona
(Casey Affleck)? Or could it be Mona's husband's mistress (Jamie Lee
Curtis)? All of the above?
The problem with Drowning Mona is that it's consistently unfunny. Is it
offbeat? Yes. Entertaining? Sometimes. But only on a few occasions does
it inspire as much as hearty chuckles. The movie is dark, yes, being as
it deals with the murder of a woman whom everyone wanted dead, but its
mood rarely translates into laughs.
That being said, rookie screenwriter Peter Steinfeld has a couple
moments where he shines. These are throwaways; they don't make the
movie, but at least they assure that Drowning Mona is worth a rental.
Example: two policemen approach a suicidal man. He desperately
yells "Don't come any closer, sheriff!" referring to DeVito. The
policeman with him yells "No! He's not a sheriff!" That was one of the
only times I laughed with this movie rather than at it.
Considering the big name cast, the performances here are, to my great
shock, merely serviceable. Bette Midler is good at playing a bitch, but
she has so little actual screentime she isn't on enough to really make
a difference. Casey Affleck is annoying as hell, using a shrill, high-
pitched voice for some reason I don't understand. Neve Campbell isn't
the brightest light bulb when it comes to satire and she makes it quite
evident with her dull, one-sided performance. The one actor who rises
above the crowd is William Fichtner, who's quite good at playing a
slimy, unsympathetic bastard. And since that's what all of the
characters sans, maybe, DeVito's are supposed to be, I wish all the
actors involved in this project were as good as Fichtner at what the
script asked them to do.
It's hard to hate Drowning Mona. Some of it is done well, especially
the uncharacteristically cheery musical score that accompanies some of
the proceedings. But there is not enough here. Not enough laughs, not
enough plot, not enough good performances. This is an interesting
failure, but a failure all the same.

Review for America's Sweethearts (2001)
"Word of advice: when you hit formica, stop."
Starring Billy Crystal, John Cusack, Catherine
Zeta-Jones, Julia Roberts, Stanley Tucci, Alan Arkin,
Christopher Walken. Directed by Joe Roth. Rated PG-13.
America's Sweethearts is what happens when satire gets
lazy. We've seen this before, and recently; Scream 3
was plagued by the same demon. It's a twist worthy of
O'Henry when a satire becomes exactly what it's
satirizing. It can also be interesting, as in Mel
Brooks's better films, but in this case it's messy and
dull. The film exhibits not a delicious sense of
irony, but obtuseness.
Pity, because Joe Roth's romantic comedy/would-be
Hollywood spoof hits the exact right note with its
opening sequence, a montage of scenes from films
starring Eddie Thomas (John Cusack) and Gwen Harrison
(Catherine Zeta-Jones), "America's Sweethearts." It's
perfect because, though exagerrated, it bears an
uncanny resemblance to actual movies, tripe like Sweet
November, The Bachelor, etc, etc. The films in the
montage were hits, but now the real-life couple has
undergone a bitter break-up and the fans are
despondent.
Unfortunately, they also have a held-over movie coming
out, a time travel drama cleverly entitled "Time Over
Time." The director (Christopher Walken), an
Oscar-winner, but so eccentric that he purchased the
unabomber's shack and uses it as his editing room, is
holding his work hostage until the press junket, when
he will show it for the first time. It's up to big
shot publicist Lee Phillips (Billy Crystal) to get
both Eddie and Gwen to the junket and, when there,
make the press forget about the fact that they haven't
seen the actual movie.
Eddie is now at a phoney-baloney self-help resort
somewhere in the mountains, with mystic guru Alan
Arkin raising his self-esteem by spouting lines like
"life is a cookie." Gwen, who initiated the break-up,
is sulking at home with her sister/slave Kiki (Julia
Roberts), who has lost a lot of weight. What does her
losing weight have to do with the plot? Well, she has
to be thin so that Eddie can fall in love with her.
Duh.
There's good stuff in the first half of America's
Sweethearts, including some good Billy Crystal lines
and unexpectedly sharp jabs at the inner workings of
Hollywood. Then, it becomes some of the sloppiest
big-budget filmmaking I have ever seen. The script is
just all over the map, with a tonal shift
approximately every other scene. The payoff, which
comes when we finally get to see the mystery movie, is
a complete failure, a decent idea that the filmmakers
ruined, making it far less incisive than they
apparently think it is.
At that point, though, the movie isn't terribly
concerned about being incisive. It had long
degenerated into one of the lame romances it was
parodying just 40 minutes earlier, with movie-star
Eddie falling in love with regular-gal Kiki. Think
Notting Hill, only reversed and much less interesting.
I hate movies that gather an amazing cast and then
waste it, intent on giving the audience what they
think it wants to see those A-list actors do. I don't
particularly care whether John and Julia fall for each
other, especially not if the film itself doesn't care.
I was hoping for sharp satire and biting wit, but
America's Sweethearts starts out well and then wimps
out.

Review for Brokedown Palace (1999)
 Starring Claire Danes, Bill Pullman. Rated PG-13
I've seen Brokedown Palace twice before. The first time it was called
Red Corner and then Return to Paradise (you are welcome to click on the
link and refresh your memory concerning the latter as I will come back
to it numerous times in this review). This, then, is nothing but typical
Hollywood recycling of earlier, superior movies. Such rehashing almost
never makes anything decent and the resulting film suffers all the more
if its predecessors are still fresh in our minds.
The first scene has "Yankee" Hank, a lawyer, receive an audio tape in
the mail. He inserts the tape into a player and listens to the story of
Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) two recent high
school graduates who come to Thailand on vacation and meet a charming
Australian fellow who convinces them to go to Hong Kong with him. At the
airport they are stopped by police who find an inordinate amount of
cocaine in one of their backpacks. Alice was carrying the backpack and
Darlene was the one who packed it but both claim to have no idea where
the narcotics came from.
They are arrested and taken to a typically brutal and unlivable Eastern-
world penetentiary where one of the girls is deceived into signing a
confession. The girls are then urged to consult with a lawyer, as there
is no sign of the mysterious Aussie, whom the girls suspect of planting
the drugs in their luggage. The lawyers they talk to both advise that
they plead guilty to the crime in hopes that the judge is lenient and
sentences them to a mere 40 years in jail as opposed to life. If they
plead innocent and are unable to provide indemnifying evidence, the
lawyer says, then the judge will not think twice before sending them to
jail for the rest of their lives.
In the movie's most compelling act, Darlene's father arrives at the
scene and attempts to enlist the help of the American embassy. Not
surprisingly, he gets no help from the embassy, leaving Alice and
Darlene with but one hope: the services of "Yankee" Hank Green, who is
more than sympathetic to the girls' cause but is equally concerned about
money and his other pressing cases.
Brokedown Palace is most reminiscent of last year's near-brilliant
Return to Paradise which placed a riveting moral dilemma in what was
essentially the same plot. This is the Hollywood version of Return to
Paradise; a sanitized reworking of what was a breathtakingly real work.
That movie was resolved mercilessly and believably while the resolution
here comes off as a contrivance. Paradise was a brilliantly pulled off
morality play which asked a thoughtful, (hopefully) rhetorical question:
would you sacrifice X years of your life to save a friend by taking
responsibility for your own mistakes or would you let him hang? Palace
is the "Monkey-see monkey-do" movie; a film in which the director leaves
the audience with nothing to do but just watch the protagonists' dilemma
unfold and sympathize with them.
But my biggest problem with Brokedown Palace isn't its blatant
hollowness but rather its ending. It's not even the fact that it's
contrived, as I mentioned earlier. What angered me is how the filmmakers
found a way to have their cake and eat it too, and in the process ended
their film on a glaringly false note. As much as I want to describe
exactly what I mean here, I cannot for fear of spoiling the film for
those who, despite my fervent admonitions, decide to see it; I will,
however say this: Brokedown Palace has one of its characters do
something that it claims is the right thing to do. At first glance the
here unspecified action may ring true, but with a little thought you
realize that it is probably the worst possible thing said character
could have done.
There are some things worthwhile in this most flawed of films. Although
Kate Beckinsale is phony in a lead role, Claire Danes is wonderful. Her
extraordinary talent manages to surprise me even the times when I fully
expect a compelling performance. Bill Pullman, never known for emoting,
is stoic but effective as "Yankee" Hank, although his character is taken
directly out of the proverbial "Screenwriter's Guide to Movie Cliches."
Somewhere near you there is a video store. Instead of going to the
theater to see Brokedown Palace rent Return to Paradise instead. Please.
It is the American moviegoer who needs to show Hollywood that sub-par
pseudo-remakes of good movies will not fly. I'm starting a crusade.

Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
Starring Julia Roberts, Richard Gere, Christopher Meloni, Joan Cusack.
Rated PG.
If I had to name the most common problems with 90's romantic comedies,
at the top of the list would be their inherent implausibility. How and
why the characters fall in love is barely ever explained; instead we are
expected to trust the old Love at First Sight/I Know She Is the One for
Me explanation. Sometimes we aren't given any explanation at all: one
scene has the soon-to-be couple bickering, fighting and hating each
other and then -- boom -- in the next scene they are passionately
kissing.
The reason I warmed up to the new Julia Roberts vehicle, none-too-subtly
monikered The Runaway Bride, is that it avoids that most common and most
frustrating of problems. This is a film that does not ask us to take a
gargantuan leap into suspension of disbelief in order for us to accept
its premise. It works not only as a comedy but also as a love story; a
compelling romance between two people that have a believable future
together.
The Runaway Bride reunites the Pretty Woman dream-team of Julia Roberts
and Richard Gere. The latter plays Ike Graham, a much-maligned USA Today
newspaper columnist who allegedly writes nothing but "bitter diatribes"
about women. Sitting in his favorite bar one day he gets a tip-off of
sorts from a fellow sitting next to him: there is a girl in his
hometown, he says, who is legendary for ditching grooms at the altar.
Ike loves it and decides to write about it. His damning mistake was
exaggerating, turning a potentially interesting article into a -- who'd
have guessed it -- a bitter diatribe about women and a lie at that.
Maggie Carpenter, the subject of Ike's column/tirade, happens to pick up
the paper that day and peruse Mr. Graham's little masterpiece. Lies
about her in a national publication don't exactly make her day so she
writes a retort to Ike's editor, correcting the 15 -- count 'em -- 15
factual errors he made. The editor (coincidentally his ex-wife) fires
him. His friend makes the down-on-his-luck Graham this offer: if he goes
to Maggie's hometown and Maggie, currently engaged for the fourth time,
runs from the altar again, he gets a cover story in GQ magazine.
Our merry journalist does go to Maggie's hometown and meets Maggie as
well some of the colorful characters in her life. There's Peggy,
Maggie's sympathetic, supportive friend (played by my favorite actress,
Joan Cusack); her stereotypically spunky grandmother, and of course her
husband-to-be Coach Bob (Christopher Meloni). Bob is a nice enough guy
but Ike can't help but wonder whether he is right for Maggie and more
importantly whether he himself has feelings for the legendary Runaway
Bride.
The romance that inevitably blooms between Maggie and Ike is, for once,
palpable and tangible. They fall in love like real people would. There
is no suddenness; the romance develops gradually and believably. We can
see not only that they have fallen for each other but also that they can
live together for many happy years.
Julia Roberts looks luminously young as Ms. Carpenter and her
performance works just as well as her makeup. She's spontaneous, funny
and human and so is her character. She pulls her role off with
impeccable precision, making us believe that Maggie is a complex adult
with real issues as opposed to an indecisive airhead who has ruined many
a life with her irresponsible choices. Richard Gere is a bit too
sarcastic and impersonal in the first 2/3 of The Runaway Bride but
finishes off strong to make his performance a success. And what can I
say about Joan Cusack? One of the best working actresses, she is in top
form: her performance is fine-tuned and hilarious even though her role
is underwritten.
The Runaway Bride likewise benefits from top-notch comic timing.
Director Gary Marshall gives his film an even, rhythmic pace and
disperses enough delightful gags to make the movie a good comedy in
addition to being an exceptional love story. Some of the jokes are
cliched, true, but even some of those are funny enough to work.
Like most romantic comedies, this one doesn't say anything exceptionally
daring or resonant, but that doesn't prevent it from being a terrific
movie. The Runaway Bride is a standout because the romance at its core
seems like a real one. In addition to laughing at what we see, we
believe it too. That has become so rare in modern movies that The
Runaway Bride should be cherished.

Review for Perfect Blue (1997/I)
 Dubbed in English from Japanese. Not Rated (Would be a strong R or an
NC-17).
For those who do not know, "anime" is a Japanese form of animation. It
has a very distinctive style and, with graphic violence and often
nudity, it's strictly for adults. Perfect Blue is one of the few animes
released on the big screen in the US and why they chose this one is
beyond me. It's an intriguing but pretentious, confusing, often
incoherent meditation on the nature of reality: a concept that has been
explored so thoroughly in Hollywood the past couple years, did we really
need to import a movie about it?
Perfect Blue tells the story of Mima, a lead singer for a pop group
named "Cham" who decides to leave music for an acting career. Her first
television role does not exactly fit in with her previous perky persona.
In fact, her deeply troubled character resembles herself all too well;
so much so that she begins to confuse her life with that of her
television counterpart.
One day she finds a page on the internet entitled "Mima's Room". It has
too much personal information: things other people wouldn't know unless
they were watching her. At the same time, she begins getting anonymous
letters -- one of them complete with a letter bomb -- and she grows
frightened. Soon the stress of her job overwhelms her and she spaces out
of reality. She is no longer able to separate the dream world from the
real world and is haunted by visions of her pop-star alter ego and a
mysterious man who seems intent on doing her harm.
After running it over in my head for hours, I am now pretty sure that I
understand just what went on in Perfect Blue, but as I was watching I
had no idea. This may have been the effect that director Satoshi Kon was
going for, but either way it doesn't work; instead of enjoying the
kinetic, visually charged production I was scratching my head. I have no
problem with films that are, by their very nature, complex, but it's no
fun when it gets to the point of being impossible to follow.
I understand that translating a film into English from another language
is a daunting task, but when said film has pretentions of being a
legitimate psychological thriller, its dialogue should not sound as if
it was written by a third-grader. Here, the content does indeed suggest
an adult suspenser but the dialogue seems to have come from The Iron
Giant (especially botched is a scene where Mima is taught to use the
internet: it comes like an extraordinarily bad commercial for an online
service).
Well-made action sequences and a terrific, powerful soundtrack almost
redeem this sloppy, incoherent movie. One of the reasons I love
animation is that it makes it easy for filmmakers to stage long,
complicated scenes that would be very difficult (i.e. expensive) to do
when bound by the limits of the real world. Perfect Blue takes full
advantage of this wonderful medium. The drawings themselves are fluid
and realistic while the things they do with the drawings are amazing.
The film does look great, but my rating would have been at least a star
higher had director Satoshi Kon paid a little less attention to the
visuals and a more to narrative cohesion. I am a sucker for "what-is-
reality" movies; even the otherwise lambasted The Thirteenth Floor eked
out a 3-star rating from me. I definitely find the premise of Perfect
Blue to be brimming with potential. Too bad the film disrupted my idea
of reality with its mediocrity.

Review for Evolution (2001)
Starring David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, Julianne
Moore, Seann William Scott. Directed by Ivan Reitman.
Rated PG-13.
Evolution, the snarky new alien invasion comedy from
Ghostbusters' Ivan Reitman, resembles the ever-popular
Men in Black in plot and structure, but that's where
the similarities end. It won't make as much money as
the Will Smith blockbuster, but it's a much better
movie: less arrogant, less enamored with its special
effects, and infinitely more clever. The advertising
for the film announced that the aliens are coming to
"wipe that silly smile off [our] planet;" quite the
contrary, though I suspect that some critics are
giving Evolution negative reviews just so they can
oh-so-cleverly twist the tagline to apply to the
movie.
David Duchovny heads up the winning cast as science
Professor Ira Kane of the Glen Canyon community
college. He is called to investigate when local
aspiring firefighter (Seann William Scott) sees a
meteor crash down from the sky and make a big hole in
the ground. With him comes Harry Block (Orlando
Jones), a geology professor from Glend Canyon and a
member of the US Geological Survey. They make an
amazing discovery -- millions of single-celled
organisms that could only have come from another
world. They take a sample back, only to find that the
single-celled organisms have turned multicellular
without so much as a warning, and are continuing to
grow and divide.
When Ira and Harry return to the scene, they discover
that the US army has appropriated the meteor. Among
the men and women in uniform is Dr. Allison Reed
(Julianne Moore), a government scientist in charge of
the investigation. Ira and Harry get short-shrifted,
with a perfuctory promise to "keep them in the loop."
But when they see that the aliens are evolving into
bigger and more menacing creatures -- some of them
looking like dinosaurs, others like sad E.T.'s, but
all equally dangerous -- and that all the government
wants to do is wipe them out, they decide to take
matters into their own hands.
Duchovny, who bit the hand that fed him by making a
showy exit from the alien-themed tv show The X-Files,
is again dealing with extra-terrestrials and an
obsessively secretive government, though, of course,
in a very different context. He's the best thing about
this movie; his deadpan style humor fits perfectly
into the general tone of the proceedings, and there is
genuine chemistry between him and his co-stars. I'm
not convinced of Duchovny's range (though Return to Me
was an impressive start), but there's no question that
he and otherworldly beings always make a good
match-up.
The movie was directed by Ivan Reitman, the veteran
who has done nothing but comedies (with the possible
exception of Six Days, Seven Nights), and it has a
penchant for the gleefully weird as well as the
vulgar. There is no other way explain a scene in which
an alien worm implants itself in Orlando Jones's body
and the doctor, planning to take it out through the,
um, anal cavity, says offhandedly that "there's no
time for lubricant." The response by the beleaguered
patient? "There's always time for lubricant!"
Evolution is not terribly consistent: there are
cliches and failed gags, and the ending is
disappointing. But when it works, it works. It looks
like the movie has failed at the box-office -- not
terribly surprising considering the lack of
name-above-the-title stars and the bizarro marketing
campaign -- and it's a real shame. 

Title
Review for I Woke Up Early the Day I Died (1998)
You don't look at a René Magritte painting and search for a deeper
meaning. You likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight.
Surrealist works are notable for their quirks, and they are fun, but
looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting. That was my
experience with I Woke Up Early the Day I Died, a surrealistic,
hyperactive comedy with no dialogue. It's not a silent movie; there is
lots of atmospheric music, occasional screams and weird sound effects,
but nobody ever utters an audible word. Though the film is distinctive,
its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes, and as it progressed,
watching became a chore.
The only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by
the pseudo-legendary Ed Wood, the man behind such "classics" as Plan 9
>From Outer Space and Night of the Ghouls. The joke, of course, is that
his films are so bad, they're good; so humorous in their inanity that
they become hits. I Woke Up Early the Day I Died, unfortunatly, is so
bad that it's really bad. It stars Billy Zane (Titanic) as a dangerous
lunatic who overpowers a nurse, escapes from a mental hospital and
proceeds to wonder around, stealing a car, clothes, and a load of money.
Our thief reaches a cemetery, where he witnesses a bizarre ritual. He
falls asleep and finds himself, literally, in a hole, with his money
gone. For whatever reason, he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash
back (considering how easily he stole it the first time, why didn't he
just go steal some more?). He comes upon a list of the people who were
at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and
kill them if they don't have what he is looking for.
I don't think either director Aris Iliopulos nor Ed Wood realized that
this would have made a glorious 20 minute short. The subject and the
style seem to have been made for it. Unfortunately, twenty minutes worth
of material is stretched out to more than four times that length, and
the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome. It grabbed my
attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on, up to
the point where halfway through I was already weary. It might seem odd
that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious; but the
surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is.
I Woke Up Early the Day I Died is a comedy, I guess, though it could
have fooled me. Unlike most Ed Wood films, this one tries to be funny
and fails, instead of the other way around. There's nothing inherently
wrong with that, in fact, I think it would only make sense for someone
who has been so "good" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab
at a real one. Whether Wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll
never know, but in either case, this is a failure.
Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Christina Ricci, Summer Phoenix, John Ritter and
others show up for short and pointless cameos. Ricci, for example, plays
a prostitute. Her role consists of dancing around with Zane in his motel
room and then being thrown out. Thomas is an astonished onlooker as a
woman gets thrown off a cliff. Was the Home Improvement teen heartthrob
really that desperate for work? Zane, meanwhile, occupies himself by
making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run
around wildly and beat people up. Lack of dialogue makes him the
ultimate caricature.
The carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is
wrong with this no-budget production. It's desperately unfunny, but
thinks it's the funniest thing since Plan 9;, it's so spontaneously
surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to
make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction. I hope another
film is made from an Ed Wood screenplay for I Woke Up Early the Day I
Died is not a fitting send-off.

Review for Gods and Monsters (1998)
Starring Ian McKellen, Brendan Fraser, Lynn Redgrave. Rated R.
Not too many people know who James Whale is, but it's a safe bet that a
good chunk of them have seen his movies. If we are to believe the semi-
biographical Gods and Monsters, Whale would have wanted it to be that
way. This is an insightful, haunting exploration of the last days of the
Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein director, and it is notable for
introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a Hollywood
movie.
Gods and Monsters has no interest in being a biopic of Whale's life
because it tracks only the final few days of his life, and it's probably
a better movie for it. It's focus is on Whale's (Ian McKellen)
untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener Clayton Boone
(Brendan Fraser). It begins with Whale (a fairly talented artist, aside
from being a director) asking Boone to "sit for him," (pose for a
portrait). At first, Boone doesn't realize that Whale is gay and grows
fascinated with the old man. When he does discover Whale's sexual
orientation from his dedicated and protective maid (Lynn Redgrave), he
is frightened, refusing to sit for the guy. But he comes back, only to
storm out again, disgusted with Whale's "locker room talk." Boone
returns yet another time, after Whale promises to tone down the
aforementioned "locker room talk," and finds their platonic relationship
to be strengthening.
Meanwhile, Jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental
attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago. His ailment leads to
desperation and depression, which build to the point where he is forced
to ask Boone for an incredulously big favor.
What is perhaps most sensational about Gods and Monsters is Brendan
Fraser's bravura performance; up until seeing this film I intensely
disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he
is in (Blast From the Past, for example). I was surprised how expressive
an actor he proved himself to be here. This is impressive because his
character's dialogue is minimal, with McKellan doing most of the
talking. That requires Fraser to act through body language; a difficult
skill to master, but something he proves capable of doing well.
This is not to ignore McKellan's Oscar nominated turn. He earned that
nomination with his touching performance here (although, at the risk of
sounding like a philistine, I would have chosen his performance as the
Nazi in Apt Pupil for the nomination); an understated, compelling gem.
Whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the Hollywood
horror genre, and he thought Hollywood to be the equivalent of a
battlefield. He rejoiced in being free from it, only reluctantly going
to receptions with fellow movie people. In the end, perhaps, it is what
killed him: the memories of Hollywood and war blending together to form
a living nightmare.

Title
Review for Go (1999)
Starring Desmond Askew, Sarah Polley, Katie Holmes, Timothy Olyphant, Taye
Diggs. Rated R.
What's a critic to do when he sees a movie he wholeheartedly enjoys but winds
up asking why it was made? What if a film's purpose and the motivation behind
it remains a mystery? What does one make of an interesting, entertaining
movie that is almost utterly pointless? Watching Go, the new flick from Doug
Liman, director of the sleeper hit Swingers put me in that very dilemma.
Go is an intriguingly structured movie in that it replays the period of time
following a drug deal 3 times: each time from the perspective of a different
character (or set of characters). First we are shown Ronna, a 17-year old
girl who works at a supermarket and is about to be evicted on Christmas Day
because she is short on her rent. When her drug trafficker friend Simon
leaves for the weekend, she jumps at the chance of making some extra bucks by
running a drug deal herself, until she finds out that her two customers are
working for the police and are about to bust her. She is forced to halt
mid-stream and dump her merchandise without getting any money, putting her in
trouble with the drug dealer whom she still owes, and whom she left a friend
of hers with as collateral. The movie then follows her as she tries to get
out of the situation, attend a rave and pay her rent all at the same time.
Then, after a rather unpredictable turn of events the screen fades to black
and we are taken all the way bact to the beginning, but this time the film
follows Simon as he goes to Las Vegas with his friends where he gets in
trouble with a nasty strip club bouncer and struggles to escape. Finally, as
we are taken back to the beginning again, we see the story from the point of
view of the two gay actors/criminals who are Ronna's "customers" working with
the cops trying to catch her in the act of committing a crime.
Go is a daring, fast-paced movie that entertains down to the bone. The
multitude of interesting characters also helps to keep the audience's
attention, and few people will be bored. The movie's script, written by John
August is full of quirky wit that will strike a chord with the film's younger
audience as well as fans of Doug Liman's slightly more upbeat Swingers.
I also liked the way Liman brought all of the characters together in the end,
revealing that they were all involved in the events that transpired after the
drug deal that went terribly wrong. But even with this neat loose-end tier,
Go suffers from lack of a common theme to tie these three stories together.
Sure, the lusty, steamy, violent and rather thrilling action is wickedly
entertaining but there's nothing to organize it and bring it all together
under the surface.
Many comparisons will be made between Go and some of Quentin Tarantino's
work, and rightfully so; some of his films have many structural similarities
with Liman's movie. The kicker, however, is that while Tarantino's dialogue
is rarely purely for dialogue's sake: there are always slight hints as to the
movie's main theme. The dialogue in Go, while funny and original, is purely
superficial.
Go is best viewed as an exceptionally good teen movie; where the viewer is
happy that it is good but restricts himself from yearning for more from Doug
Liman. More ambitious moviegoers may be dissappointed with this derivative
frivolous exercise. But like I said before: No one will be bored.

Review for Serendipity (2001)
"What's your favorite New York moment?"
Starring John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Eugene Levy,
Molly Shannon. Directed by Peter Chelsom. Rated PG-13.
There's no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow
a distinct pattern: guy sees girl, guy wants girl, guy
goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl, guy
gets girl. In rare cases, the genders are flipped.
Predictability is a given. Rarely, though, is a
romantic comedy as cheap, as obvious, or as pointless
as Serendipity, a film that uses its "theme" as an
excuse for its plot contrivances. "Lightweight"
doesn't begin to describe it. This is like
anti-gravity.
It begins in a New York City Bloomingdale's, a product
placement that rivals Cast Away's FedEx for sheer
blatancy. Jonathan Trager (John Cusack) and Sara
Thomas (Kate Beckinsale) both go for the same pair of
gloves. After going through the perfunctory motions,
Jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them
go out for ice cream, followed by ice skating.
Jonathan falls hard, and Sara is charmed. When she
writes her name and number down on a piece of paper, a
truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand. She
takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldn't be
together; Jonathan is flabbergasted. To pacify him,
she comes up with an idea: Jonathan will write his
number on a 5 dollar bill, which she will promptly
spend. When she gets home, she will write her name and
number inside a book ("Love in the Time of Cholera")
and sell it to a used bookstore. If the bill gets back
to her or the book to him, it will mean that they are
meant to be together.
Three years later. Both Sara and Jonathan are now
engaged to other love interests. Both realize they
aren't content. Both go looking for the other. What
happens now is so absurd that I'm almost tempted to
recommend the film for the sake of seeing it. The two
of them run circles around each other in a set of
incredible "coincidences" that I would describe as
contrivances if it weren't for the film oh-so-cleverly
dismissing that criticism by building its plot around
"serendipity." Of course, since the movie is about
fate, the screenwriter can do anything he damn well
pleases. I'm not buying it.
There's no suspense in any of this because we know
exactly what's going to happen, but Serendipity
insists on drilling its purportedly "adorable"
non-story into our heads. Instead of "Will they meet?"
the question we're asking is "When will they meet
already?" To make matters worse, every "coincidence"
is telegraphed from a mile away; by the last reel I
was bored enough to actively look for signs that
something else "incredible" was going to happen.
Cusack is fine and Beckinsale, at least, isn't saddled
with another lumbering, clunky screenplay (she's had
bad luck, what with Brokedown Palace and Pearl Harbor
on her resume), just an inanely pointless one.
Serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing
Eugene Levy, who plays a snarky Bloomingdale's
salesman.
What's the interest in watching a movie that spirals
around and around a predestined (no pun intended)
conclusion? Serendipity wants to tug at the
heartstrings, but it only tests our patience. 

Title
Review for Sleepy Hollow (1999)
Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Casper Van Dien, Miranda
Richardson, Michael Gambon, Mark Pickering. Rated R.
There are a lot of words that signify praise in the dictionary. If I
used them all, it wouldn't do Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow justice. Some
movies go beyond the grasp of the English language. I probably can't
give you a satisfactory description of this one, you have to see it for
yourself. I'll try, but listen: if what you read about this movie here
doesn't sound particularly intriguing to you, see it anyway.
It is an adaptation of Washington Irving's "The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow," but it's the Tim Burton version of the classic horror story.
The general plot (especially the ending) has been tinkered with to
accomodate Burton's glorious stylistic eccentricities. It is, of
course, the legend of the Headless Horseman, the mysterious entity that
terrorizes the small town of Sleepy Hollow, chopping off citizens'
heads at will. Or, that is what the superstitous village folk suspect
and are not too eager to be dissuaded from in favor of something less
fantastic.
Enter Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp). A cynical, fancy-schmancy, rather
girlish investigator from New York City, he is called in to investigate
the beheadings in Sleepy Hollow. Of course, he doesn't believe the
Headless Horseman tales for a second; he is convinced that the murderer
is human and is determined to find him. He receives what seems like a
warm welcome, but he can't help but notice something afoot; the town's
prime citizens seem to be plotting something and concealing important
details from him.
He does eventually have an encounter with the horseman himself and is
immediately persuaded of his supernatural existence. What he is not
sure about, however, is his independence. Certain clues lead him to
believe that there is someone behind the horseman, controlling him and
determining his victims. Since nobody in the town is particularly keen
on going into the woods and seeking out the murderer, Ichabod and a
child of one of the murdered are to go it alone.
Meanwhile, Ichabod falls for the daughter of one of the prime suspects
(Christina Ricci) and the two star off an eccentric relationship,
neither of them willing to take it to the next level. She is, of
course, destined to play a vital role in how the rest of the story
unspools.
At the risk of making an overly encompassing, generalizing statement,
Sleepy Hollow is probably the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.
Every shot, every frame is nothing less than a work of art, something
to study and admire. Ordinary is obviously not a word Burton (who,
incidentally, directed stuff like Batman, Ed Wood and, my personal
favorite, Mars Attacks!) is not familiar with. All visual elements --
the trees, the sky, the fog, the town itself -- look and feel like they
are from some twisted gothic fairy tale; the result is the epitome of
gorgeousness. I have yet to see the film another time, but I plan to do
that as soon as possible; one viewing is unsatisfactory if one wants to
pick out all of the film's visual intricacies. If I don't see an Art
Direction nomination from this, I will be, pardon the colloquialism,
bitching.
Aside from being aesthetically stunning, Sleepy Hollow is exciting,
engrossing and fast-paced. The prevalent horror scenes are staged with
thought and panache. Every sequence is executed flawlessly; the editing
if perfect and the gore, while abundant, doesn't seem excessive or get
in the way of the action. Visually adept movies can't merely be pretty;
the camerawork has to serve the plot and the staging has to work
impeccably. In Sleepy Hollow, everything works.
I think Johnny Depp, a Burton veteran, sheds his pretty boy image here,
if only temporarily. His Ichabod is awesome. He's like the anti-hero.
There's a scene somewhere in the middle of the movie where he and a
young boy are walking into what seems to be a witch's lair. Ichabod,
frightened, actually walks into the cave protecting himself with the
boy pushing him in front and "covering" him with a firearm. There's
another where Ichabod sees a spider and, with a girlish scream, hops on
a stool. The beauty about scenes like those is that Depp, of all
people, makes us believe them without eliciting disdain for his
character.
Sleepy Hollow takes a conventional story and turns it into something
wholly extraordinary: a mainstream work of art. I have no doubt in my
mind that mass audiences will get a kick out of this and yet it is much
more than a crowd pleaser. It is simple in plot but endlessly complex
in execution. Heads Will Roll and Sleepy Hollow is perfect.

Title
Review for U-571 (2000)
Starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel, Jon Bon Jovi.
Directed by Jonathan Mostow. Rated PG-13.
Jonathan Mostow is a director with few pretensions. He knows what genre
he is working in -- so far it has been pure action -- and invests all
of his efforts in making the best damn genre movie possible. His first
two Hollywood projects, the Kurt Russell thriller Breakdown and now the
splendid submarine movie U-571 have both been rousingly successful in
doing one thing: generating pure, unadulterated suspense. The dialogue
is minimal, the characterization is purely perfunctory but with Mostow,
it doesn't seem to matter. I doubt anyone is going to accuse Mostow of
being the next Hitchcock, but I doubt he'll mind: he's too confident
and smart a director.
The film has one of my heretofore least favorite Hollywood actors earn
at least a little of my respect. Matthew McConaughey, whom I had given
up on a long time ago, plays Tyler, an executive officer in the Marines
who, in the beginning of the film (and in the middle of WWII), is
complaining to his superior (Bill Paxton) about his being refused his
own submarine to commandeer. Literally moments later, he gets his wish.
He and a varied group of Marines, some experienced and some not, are
being sent on a covert mission: to retrieve the Enigma, a machine that
would help the Allies decode secret messages that the Axis powers are
sending to each other. This involves pretending to be a Nazi submarine
to raid another one that is broken down at sea.
As the film's marketing campaign reveals, the operation does not go
smoothly. They retrieve the Enigma and are about to get back on their
sub and go home when it is blown up by torpedoes. McConaughey and Co.
are now stuck on an unfamiliar German submarine. Only one of them knows
how to read German and extensive repairs are necessary to get the sub
moving again. As if that wasn't enough, they also have a Nazi
battleship to contend with...
U-571 simulates the same creaky, dripping underwater atmosphere as did
Das Boot, the mother of all submarine movies, as well as The Abyss,
which went quite a bit deeper into the blue sea. There have been
others, but few done as well as this one. Not since Titanic has a
camera been so much a part of the action: it tirelessly chases after
the actors, sweeps around the cramped sets and goes in for terrifying
close-ups of the soldiers' wrenched faces. The film doesn't bother to
define interesting characters -- the people here are mostly just
composites of conventions from earlier films -- and yet we worry about
the people we see on the screen.
Mostow effectively uses silence to help the excitement along. I'm a
firm believer that a strong soundtrack can save an action movie but
moments when we hear nothing can be just as suspenseful as blaring
music. As Alfred Hitchcock said, it's not the bang that scares you,
it's the anticipation. When the aforementioned battleship starts
dropping charges in the water above the submarine, we hear the muffled
explosions get louder and louder. Before we know it, we're on the edge
of our seats awaiting the "Boom" that will send our beloved crew
members flying. We know it will happen but Mostow stages these scenes
so masterfully that we have fun simply waiting for it.
McConaughey, it seems, has finally found his niche. Much like Keanu
Reeves, the actor is most effective when the least is required from
him. There is no complexity to this role -- I don't even remember the
character's name -- and he shines in it. He doesn't have to emote much
and he manages to make his character sympathetic.
U-571 is frightening and claustrophobic and yet it is never cold or
unpleasant. Like he did in Breakdown, Mostow creates heroes we can root
for, puts them in a situation we can get interested in and then has
them solve the conflict at hand in spectacularly exciting ways.

Title
Review for End of the Affair, The (1999)
Starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart. Directed
by Neil Jordan. Rated R.
Neil Jordan is one of those writer-directors who don't quite grasp the
first rule of literary adaptations: what reads well on the page doesn't
always translate well to celluloid. I haven't read Graham Greene's The
End of the Affair on which this movie of the same name is based, but
the film seems so soulless, the dialogue so archetypically "romantic",
it is fairly obvious that Jordan took Greene's prose to heart. Even the
sex scenes are perfunctory.
The story is actually a beguilingly simple love triangle that could
have worked wonderfully had it not been hampered by a deadly slow pace
and pretentious, irrelevant philosophizing. Maurice Bendrix (Ralph
Fiennes), a novelist, has an affair with Sarah (Julianne Moore,
nominated for a Golden Globe) in 1944. Sarah abruptly ends the
relationship and Maurice doesn't know why. She doesn't love her husband
(Stephen Rea) and her husband Henry doesn't really love her either;
their marriage is a sham, a useless tradition, a habit they find
difficult to drop.
It is now 1946 and on a rainy night Maurice encounters Henry walking in
the park. Henry is worried that Sarah is cheating on him. Maurice
offers Henry the services of a private detective. He staunchly refuses
and Maurice leaves, but on his way out, he passes Sarah on the stairs.
The old flame lights again inside him; out of jealousy he hires a
private detective (Ian Hart, providing the only flashes of wit in this
decidedly humorless drama) to follow Sarah around.
I'm not going to reveal the reason Sarah ended the affair in this
review -- we don't find out until more than halfway through and I
suppose it's one of the secrets the movie has -- but I will say that
it's not particularly satisfying. It introduces a religious subtext to
an already thematically confused script and it gives Jordan the ill-
advised opportunity to insert a second rambling voiceover that tries to
add philosophical meaning to the proceedings. I prefer movies that let
the viewer come to his own conclusions rather than ones that spell
everything out via a convenient narrator. The End of the Affair has two.
Effectively stripping the film of almost all dramatic tension, the
characters deliver their lines with all the spontaneity of a
regurgitated Shakesperean monologue. At any given moment, I was
expecting Fiennes to turn to the camera and start detailing what he was
planning to say next film noir-style. At least Ian Hart as the PI
brings some much-needed air of humanity into the movie; his bumbling
gumshoe is the only clue that we are watching real people rather than
store mannequins.
If I was never emotionally involved, the movie at least kept my
attention, mostly thanks to the hypnotic Michael Nyman score and the
production design -- I have seen nary a more gorgeous "bleak" look.
Jordan, who made The Butcher Boy, one of my favorite films of 1998, is
a superb technical director. Even the otherwise turgid In Dreams was
nearly saved by its top-notch visual style. Here, too, the camera is
always in the right place, slow motion film stock is used effectively
and Jordan just all-around knows what he is doing. Too bad he has what
seem to be malign intentions: to subdue the actors until they come off
as robots.
As if all that wasn't enough, the movie refuses to end. The credits
finally roll after about seven scenes where I thought, "this has to be
the final one." Jordan follows what should have been the ending with a
bunch of pointless sequences that don't tie up loose ends as much as
they unnecessarily drag out the plot.
That said, it's easy to see why The End of the Affair appeals to award
voters and many critics. It's old-fashioned, supposedly representing a
temporary return to the good old days of cinematic bliss when movies
could sweep you off your feet with their sheer romanticism. With so
much avant-garde making a triumphant appearance this past year, the
older crowd's tendency to stick by this movie is understandable. But I
prefer the new over the old if "old" means pretense and soullessness.
It's good to see a filmmaker defy trends, but I'd rather see it done in
new ways rather than resorting to methods used decades ago.

Title
Review for Being John Malkovich (1999)
 "Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man."
Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, Orson Bean, John
Malkovich Rated R.
As many of us have long suspected, and as Being John Malkovich proves,
the people behind the enigma we know as Hollywood really should be
institutionalized. I don't know what idiot had the bright idea to
finance this insane movie, but whoever it was should get an honorary
Oscar. The result is an exercise in bona fide originality, a wacky,
weird film that is surreal and straight-forward at the same
time. "Offbeat" doesn't even begin to describe it.
An abstract of the plot will give some of you the temptation to dive
for your browser's "Back" button, but stay with me. The film stars John
Cusack as Craig Schwartz, an unhappily married (to Cameron Diaz, whom I
didn't even recognize until a third of the way into the movie)
puppeteer who is forced to get a day job at Lester Corp., a filing
business on the 7 1/2th floor of a skyscraper where the ceilings are so
low, the employees have to stoop the whole time. The company is headed
by 105 year-old Dr. Lester, whose odd secretary has convinced him that
he is suffering from a speech impediment even though he speaks clearly.
So one sunny afternoon, as Craig is merrily filing away, a stack of
papers falls behind a cabinet. Craig moves the cabinet away from the
wall and is shocked to discover a little door, which opens to a
passageway just big enough for him to crawl through. Curious, he goes
in. After a few feet, the door is shut and he is sucked deeper into the
hole until he reaches John Malkovich. Let me clarify. This rabbit hole
that Craig finds is -- yes -- a portal into the head of John Malkovich,
the actor. For 15 minutes, you get to experience the world through John
Malkovich's eyes, until you are thrown in a ditch by the New Jersey
Turnpike.
It gets weirder yet. You see, Craig falls for his sexy co-worker Maxine
(Catherine Keener)... and so does his wife, who all of a sudden
realizes that she wants to be a man. When Maxine starts actually dating
Malkovich, both Craig and his wife use the portal to have sex with
Maxine via Malkovich. Meanwhile, Craig and Maxine start a service: for
some $200 a pop, you can be John Malkovich for 15 minutes.
Alright, you can catch your breath. I can wait.
All done? Good. My first order of business, then, is to inform you that
even though you may have been positively repulsed by my plot synopsis,
Being John Malkovich is a masterpiece of lunacy. Love it or hate it,
it's the most inventive thing to come about since The Truman Show. The
idea itself seems inconceivable. I'm not sure who thought of it, but
whoever did has a great future in Hollywood. Even more importantly,
Hollywood needs him.
The brilliance of Being John Malkovich is in the execution as well as
the concept. First time director Spike Jonze made one genius move: his
movie never admits just how weird it is. The script is way out there,
but everything is laid out in a matter-of-fact style. In effect, the
film is the epitome of deadpanning, which is exactly what makes it so
effective. There is a point in the middle of the film where Cameron
Diaz tells John Cusack not to "stand in the way of her actualization as
a man." The line is hilarious, the funniest thing I've heard all year.
And yet unlike any gag the Austin Powers sequel, for instance, it
doesn't feel like it was intended to elicit gales of laughter. So we
laugh in retrospect rather than right then and there. And ya know what?
It's been a week and the joke only gets funnier.
Kudos to the real two-time Oscar nominee John Malkovich for agreeing to
play this slightly exaggerated version of himself. The role stops just
short of self-parody; the actor is never jeered or mocked. Indeed, this
is probably Malkovich's best role and best performance to date. I
strongly believe that the hardest role to play is yourself. John
Malkovich's work here should not be ignored come award time.
I saw Being John Malkovich immediately after Mansfield Park, which was
unoriginal and mostly uninteresting. I appreciated Malkovich that much
more. It's a film to treasure.

Title
Review for Wood, The (1999)
"I'll give you a dollar if you grab her booty!"
Starring Omar Epps, Sean Nelson, Taye Diggs, Trent Cameron, Richard T
Jones, Duane Finley. Rated R.
Films featuring adults reminiscing about times and friends they had when
they were kids have the potential to be tremendously effective. When
done right, they can be sad (Stand By Me had me in tears), funny,
nostalgic and just plain terrific. But as is the case with every genre,
there is no foolproof formula for making a good movie. With its constant
ineptitude, The Wood demonstrates that for every winner there's a dud.
We are introduced to the people with whom we are about to spend two
hours when they actually start talking to us. Omar Epps (The Mod Squad)
kicks off the movie by speaking directly into the camera, introducing
himself as "Big Mike". You see, Roland, one of Mike's best friends, is
about to be married -- only he's nowhere to be found. His other friend,
Slim, is terribly nervous (in fact, when he sees Mike speaking he blurts
out "Who the hell you talking to?"). It's not long before the story goes
into flashback, as the three buddies fondly recall their adolescent
years in "The Wood" ("not what you think," says Mike, although what you
may be thinking soon becomes a recurring motif; what is being referred
to is the town of Inglewood, California, a suburb of LA).
The Wood tracks the girl-chasing adventures of the three teenagers. From
a booty-grabbing contest that gets Mike into trouble with a nasty big
brother to an American Pie-ish who-shall-get-nookie-first contest, this
movie seems concerned solely with the boys' relationships with the
fairer gender.
I wish this film had explored more than one aspect of the potentially
interesting lives of these characters. A movie solely about "gettin'
some" can be immensely entertaining when it is said film's sole focus,
like in American Pie. Here, however, we get a movie that is supposedly
the story of the friendships of these three people when they were young.
Thus, it is disheartening to see it refuse to do anything interesting
with that scenario. The extent of The Wood's versatility is the
characters' choice of breath mints.
The first hour of this veritable sap-o-rama entertains, with some funny
gags and affecting moments. But then The Wood falls apart. At nearly two
hours its at least half an hour too long and it begins to repeat itself.
The same jokes turn up more times than we find it fitting to laugh at
them. Before we know it, what we've wound up with is yet another retread
of the Horny Teenager Movie even though its first hour lead us to
believe otherwise.
The characters are exclusively one-dimensional as are, for the most part
the performances from the six leads. The standout, is Omar Epps as adult
Mike, whose performance is sincere. Sean Nelson who plays young Mike has
an annoying fish-out-of-water quality: the story calls for him to make
us believe that his character has just moved from North Carolina to
California and doesn't know anyone or anything there. He goes one
better: he makes us think his character just moved from Venus.
The Wood is a movie with a one-track mind, which is unfortunate because
had it tried to develop other aspects of its characters it may have been
a fascinating character study. As it is, it's a mildly diverting, seldom
entertaining piece of alleged nostalgia that doesn't seem very nostalgic
at all.

Review for Muse, The (1999)
 "You have to turn around, park in the lot and walk to the building. You
don't have a drive-on."
"Excuse me?"
"You don't have a drive-on, you have a walk-on."
"Is that the worst a person could get or is there like a crawl-on?"
Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie McDowell, Jeff Bridges.
Rated PG-13.
The movie is about Muses: descendants of the Gods said to be able to
inspire artists. I think Albert Brooks is a God. He hasn't made a bad
movie in his entire career (granted, a 6 film career, but six good films
in a row is a streak any filmmaker should be -- and is -- envious of).
At their worst his films are funny; at their best they are masterpieces
of comic precision and intelligent, tasteful humor.
The Muse, his new film, is a delightful experience. Charming, hilarious
and very Brook-ish, it is a worthy addition to what has been an
inordinately successful 20-year directing career. Brooks handles his
tricky material perfectly, cooking up an impeccable combination of the
supernatural, the off-beat and the Hollywood inside jokes.
Our protagonist is Steven Phillips, a heretofore successful screenwriter
who has just been fired. Why? Because he has "lost his edge".
Understandably Steven asks what that means. I began to wonder myself.
You hear that so often in the movie, tv and book business that it has
become a staple phrase and yet I don't know what the "edge" is and how
one can "lose" it. That is what everyone tells Steven when they read the
latest script and yet nobody is able to explain what it means. They all
advise that he take a year off work, get that mystical "edge" back.
That's not an option for him because he's no billionaire and he has a
family to feed. He's left up the creek without a paddle; he has no idea
what's wrong with his work or, more importantly, how he can fix it.
He pleads with his enviably successful screenwriter buddy Jack (Jeff
Bridges) for help. Jack divulges that he employs the services of a Muse.
That's right -- a Muse -- the mythical woman said to be able to breathe
inspiration into anyone with writer's/painter's/actor's/author's block.
The Muse's name is Sarah, and she's a tough cookie. First you have to
get her to "take your case", mainly by showering her with lavishly
expensive gifts. If she does decide to take you on you have to obey her
every command in return for alleged inspiration. She takes Steve on. She
orders that he put her up in a suite at the Four Seasons, run countless
errands for her and attend to her every wish. If he does, she insists,
he'll write a script that will make him so much money he may neverh ave
to write another one again.
The relationship between Steve and sarah gets weird. Brooks, bless his
soul, never lets The Muse develop into a romantic comedy. What he does
do, however, is have Sarah move in with Steve. At that point, various
guests come to Steve's home looking to use the Muse; people like Martin
Scorcese (who wants to remake Raging Bull with a really thin guy) and
James Cameron (no Titanic sequel for him, poor fella) all showing up
seeking inspiration. As if that wasn't enough, Sarah decides to assist
Steve's wife (Andie McDowell) in starting her own "Mrs. Fields" style
baking business, a fact which deeply troubles Steve.
The film's biggest commodity, of course, is the jokes, the jokes, the
jokes. They keep a-flyin', and the amazing thing is that they all work.
Well, almost. As a matter of fact, the ratio of gags to laughs rivals
that of Brooks classics such as the untouchable Defending Your Life.
This one may not be as profound or emotionally affecting as that film,
but it is at least just as funny.
Its claim to fame, however, is Sharon Stone as the leading lady in one
of her only comedic roles. And make no mistake, she is wonderful as the
mysterious title character. I doubt she will become a top-billed
comedianne anytime soon, but "this will do" wouldn't do her performance
justice. Equally successful is Andie McDowell, whom I didn't appreciate
as an actress up until this movie. Albert Brooks is as good a comic as
he is a director: his performance is typical but also typically
effective.
Unlike most other Albert Brooks films there is not much of substance in
The Muse, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. It's even better if
you know your movies: the countless Hollywood inside jokes can be easy
to miss if you don't get them. Even if you're not an insider you can
still enjoy this fluffy light comedy, a hilarious ode -- not a spoof but
a tribute -- to Hollywood; a film that emphasizes that there's no
business like showbusiness.

Review for X (1996)
Directed by Rintaro. Unrated (would be rated R due to strong, pervasive
animated violence and nudity).
I am not at all an anime (adult Japanese animation) aficionado; I have
seen very little and what I have seen has not particularly enthused me.
But here, at long last, is an anime I can get excited about. X, made in
1996 and only now getting to America, is complex, rather confusing but
outrageously exciting all the same. It's an apocalyptic vision,
superficially not unlike End of Days, except that it has an interesting
plot that actually makes some sense. Though at times hampered by
awkward dialogue and less-than-fluid action sequences, X remains a
riveting adult science fiction adventure.
At the center of the story is a young man named Kamui. In a dream he
sees his deceased mother, who tells him to go to Tokyo, though she
doesn't specify why. Curious, he follows her advice and goes to the
city. Once there, he seeks out his best friend Fuma and his sister
Kotori. In the meantime, a mysterious Oracle visits him in his dreams.
She tells him the story of the Dragon of the Earth and the Dragon of
Heaven, two opposing armies who are about to fight the final battle for
the future of the planet. If the Dragon of the Earth wins, mankind will
be wiped out and the planet will be cleansed of the species that, in
their constant effort to better their lifestyle, destroyed it. If the
Dragon of Heaven wins, mankind -- and the city of Tokyo -- will be
saved.
The kicker is that Kamui, whose name stands for "Power of God," has the
power to decide the outcome of the war by siding with one of the
armies. The Oracle and her group of mankind supporters urge Kamui to
side with the Dragon of Heaven but the Oracle's evil sister has other
plans. She recruits Fuma, who is rumored to have the exact same powers
as Kamui and tells him that whatever Dragon Kamui becomes, Fuma must
become the other. Their Destiny is Preordained (that is actually one of
the versions of the title); they must fight each other to the death.
The movie is brief, fast and furious. It rarely stops to explain
anything and if you get lost, you're left behind. But if you pay
attention and take a couple of small steps into suspension of
disbelief, X becomes an immensely satisfying experience. The plot is
farfetched, yes, but it's also utterly engrossing; we don't just see
our planet being put at risk, we care. The plot moves along so fast
that if something in it becomes unclear the best thing to do is forget
about it and concentrate on what's on-screen because otherwise you lose
track. That can happen at any moment and yet I was involved enough in
the story that I tried desperately (and, thank God, was ultimately
successful) to keep it together in my mind. That has to be a good sign.
Another good aspect of the storyline is the idea of two friends pitted
against each other by insurmountable fate. The idea is not a new one,
but it still manages to be effective pathos when done correctly. Helped
out tremendously by a poignant ending, X manages to turn the tables,
avoid the formulas and weave a compelling human story into a kinetic
science fiction thriller.
The film is not without its problems. Japanese must be a very difficult
language to translate because the few animes that I have seen have all
featured very awkward dialogue. Perhaps it's the culture difference, I
don't know. With a plot as feverishly fast as this one, you tend not to
care about the authenticity of the dialogue, but some conversations are
so cringe-worthy, you can't help but notice. It's also worth mentioning
that some of the action sequences are a little confusing, with
explosions everywhere and people jumping all over the place, making it
hard to keep track of what exactly is going on.
If you go see X, do not buy a beverage. If you have to go to the
bathroom, you might as well not come back. It will most likely take all
of your concentration to keep up with the movie, but it will be worth
it.

Review for Original Sin (2001)
"Say it! Say that you love me! You better make me
believe it. Your life depends on it."
Starring Angelina Jolie, Antonio Banderas, Thomas
Jane. Directed by Michael Cristofer. Rated R.
It's been a while since Hollywood has come out with a
really good, sultry, steamy, shameless melodrama. I'm
not a fan of the genre, but an occasional entry can be
a terrific guilty pleasure. So I found myself looking
forward to Original Sin, the year's most bad-mouthed
studio release. But while it's sultry, steamy and
shameless, it is not, unfortunately, really good.
The story concerns Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a
rich coffee merchant who has procured a mail-order
bride from Delaware. When the woman, named Julia
Russell (Angelina Jolie), arrives, Vargas is surprised
to find that she looks nothing like the picture he
received. Russell covers himself by saying that, since
she is quite the looker, she sent a picture of her
sister to make sure that her man wasn't interested in
her solely because of her "pretty face." This is hint
number one that Julia is Not What She Seems, and it is
followed by a mysterious trunk that she just can't
open, a sister she neglects to write to, and a
mysterious private detective who appears out of
nowhere. Of course, Luis is too dense to pick up on
any of this.
The only suspense generated here isn't whether Julia
will take the money and run, it's how soon she will do
it. Turns out that it's about halfway through, and
Luis's complete astonishment at that point is truly
laughable. There have been idiotic protagonists
before, but I think this transcends all boundaries.
This is about when the movie stops being at all
interesting, even in a cheesy so-bad-it's-good way. To
have effective melodrama, you need at least one
character that the audience can identify with; in the
heated, violent confrontations between the two
pro/antagonists that occur in Original Sin's second
half, I disliked them both. Jolie's character is a
scoundrel and Banderas is a vengeful jerk, and a dense
one at that. Their mental tug-of-war is rendered
pointless, because I would just as soon see their
hotel room on fire with them in it than see either one
of them win.
It doesn't help that director Michael Cristofer (Body
Shots) isn't really competent; his camerawork too
often resembles an actual daytime soap opera (I don't
know if he has any experience in the field, but this
wouldn't be out of place at 1 pm on ABC). He does
things like cutting between different shots of the
same scene from the same angle, a bizarre eye-roller
of a camera trick that pretentiously calls attention
to itself. And when he does it during a sex scene,
it's downright absurd.
But for all its shortcomings -- and there are
countless -- Original Sin does have a redeeming
factor, and it's a big one. Angelina Jolie can make us
believe the most farfetched dialogue and rise above
any material she is given. There's also, of course,
the fact that she provides a reason for just about
everyone on the XY side of the chromosomal map to
shell out eight bucks.
Aside from that, nothing to see here. I can't sit here
and write that I was bored -- I was either laughing
derisively, awaiting Cristofer's next demonstration of
ineptitude, or ogling at the aforementioned member of
the cast -- but this isn't a good movie by any stretch
of the imagination. I'm still hard-pressed to tell you
to stay away. 

Title
Review for Never Been Kissed (1999)
Never Been Kissed
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/neverbeenkissed.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Drew Barrymore, David Arquette, Molly Shannon, Michael Vartan. Rated
PG-13
The first line of Never Been Kissed is "You know how some movies have these
dream sequences but they don't tell you it's a dream? Well, this is so not a
dream." If you examine those two sentences closely, you'll notice that they
don't really make sense. However, they made me sit up in my chair and really
pay attention, because those two sentences when placed at the beginning of a
film are somehow appealing, unusual, almost like a dream. This very well
describes the movie that follows those words. Wasting no time, we are
introduced to Josie Geller, a shy young copy editor for the Chicago
Sun-Times, who prides herself in her neatness and precision and who feels it
necessary to correct everyone else's grammar usage errors. She's a young,
small-time employee, who seems to be waiting for her big break as a reporter.
That break comes at a company meeting where her boss (played with hilarious
gusto by Garry Marshall) gives her an undercover assignment -- she is to
enroll in high school and investigate what the cool people of the 90's like
to do.
This is both delightful and depressing to Josie. She is overjoyed at her big
opportunity as an undercover reporter. But high-school also brings back
excruciating memories. She was the queen of geeks back then. The whole school
would mock her shouting "Josie Grosie!". She was invited to the prom by the
guy that she adored, only to be devastated when, on prom night, she finds out
it was a joke and gets pummeled with raw eggs as she is standing outside her
house in a dress waiting for her date.
So, you can imagine how it would be difficult for Josie to go back to all
those memories and attempt to fit in among teenagers, again. But go to
high-school she does, wearing a ridiculous outfit, being mocked, spit on and
rejected. She has no success among the "in" crowd, which is her assignment,
until her 23-year old cool brother (David Arquette) also enrolls in high
school and literally tells everyone to like her.
The idea, as well as the film itself, is completely implausible. It is
unconceivable that in this day and age, two twenty-year olds would be able to
enroll in a high school, without having their age revealed or at least
without generating some suspicion. It is also ridiculous that there could be
stories in the Sun-Times telling about an undercover reporter at that high
school, and not have anyone snoop around to find out who the person is. But
in this particular film, it hardly seems to matter. You see, Never Been
Kissed plays out almost like a surrealistic fantasy. Time flies when watching
it, and one feels almost as if he is in a dream.
The movie is ridden with cliches, but since nothing we see on the screen
seems real (in a good way), those cliches are there exclusively to make a
point. And the film's point is a nostalgic one; it seems to be saying that
people come and go, but school does not fundamentally change. The same kinds
of people will be there time and again, and what really matters what breed
you choose to fit into, what games you choose to play.
Drew Barrymore gives a charming performance in an interesting exploration of
what might happen if a girl gets a second chance at being young. She has a
big part in a little movie, making it twice as important for her to come
through, and she does. We are with her character every step of the way, and
we absorb and understand every dilemma that faces her.
Director Raja Gosnell, who made his directing debut almost two years ago, with
the digestible Home Alone 3, completely triumphs with this graceful,
entertaining, smart teen comedy/adult fantasy. It's not only funny, it's also
profound, touching and relatively subtle. Never Been Kissed blows a glaring
opportunity at the very end to really make its point heard, but I was too
delighted with the last two hours to complain.

Review for Cats & Dogs (2001)
Featuring the voice talents of Tobey Maguire, Alec
Baldwin, Sean Hayes, Susan Sarandon, Joe Pantoliano,
Michael Clarke Duncan, and starring Jeff Goldblum,
Elizabeth Perkins, Alexander Pollock and Miriam
Margolyes. Directed by Lawrence Guterman. Rated PG.
While other films have had it as a subplot, Cats &
Dogs is probably the first film to focus on the
eon-old rivalry between the two titular species. You'd
think, though, that said rivalry would be domestic in
nature, consisting of kitchen hijinks, running up
trees and other varied kinds of Tom & Jerry-style
ephemera. But, since all American movies must take
their subjects to their logical conclusions, the cats
and dogs here have their own secret societies,
complete with elaborate plans for world domination.
There are human characters as well, namely Professor
Brody (Jeff Goldblum), his wife (Elizabeth Perkins)
and his pre-teen son Scott (Alexander Pollock).
Professor Brody is working on a formula to eliminate
dog allergies in humans. This formula is very
important to the dog underworld, of course, since
their world still revolves around humans despite
having technology that's just as advanced. To the
cats, led by the nefarious Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes),
the formula spells (smells?) disaster, and they want
to steal it. Meanwhile, in their own labs, they work
on a way to reverse the formula to make all humans
allergic to dogs.
After the canine agent in charge of protecting the
Brody formula is dognapped, headquarters sends in a
new agent, a young recruit straight out of the
Academy. He never gets there. Instead, the Brodys get
a clueless young beagle pup named Lou (Tobey Maguire),
who wouldn't know a walkie-talkie if it rammed him on
the head. It's up to him, then, with support by a
next-door veteran agent (Alec Baldwin) to protect the
formula against Russian spy cats, ninja cats and other
feline schemes.
Cats & Dogs' script is completely commercial and
conventional, likely written and rewritten until an
executive thought it was in the best form to please
the most people. That the film still works is the
result of seamless special effects, solid performances
by reliable stars and those flashes of imagination
that were still left over. I like the way that the
doggie underworld was depicted; it's always good to
see a movie that isn't afraid to look a little silly.
I like, too, that the film made the cats villains.
I've always thought there was something sinister about
those creatures and Cats & Dogs confirms my
suspicions. Actually, I'm just allergic to them and
I'm venting my anger. Don't mind me.
There are some clever one-liners, such as the
painfully obvious but still funny exclamation "Son of
my mom!" given to one of the lead canines. Others are
just painfully obvious, such as a stray dog calling
herself "domestically challenged." And Will and
Grace's Sean Hayes is consistently a hoot as Mr.
Tinkles; I don't know where the hell he came from all
of a sudden, but I want to see more of him in
big-screen comedy.
What disappointed me most was the film's decision to
turn into a sugary (more like lumpy) boy-and-his-dog
tale. Since all eyes are on the special effects and
the central inter-species rivalry, nobody in the
audience cares whether or not little Scott likes his
puppy or not, and neither do the filmmakers. The
resulting subplot works best if you ignore it.
You get the idea. The movie is hit-and-miss. But the
90 minutes go by fast, and this is adequate family
entertainment.

Review for South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut (1999)
South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com
Member: Online Film Critics Society
"Remember what the MPAA says: Horrific and deplorable violence is ok as
long as you don't say any naughty words."
Featuring the voice talents of Matt Stone, Trey Parker, Mary Kay
Bergman. Rated R.
Filmmakers jump on real-life controversies faster than Austin Powers on
Felicity Shagwell. The debate on whether cinema is to blame for
teenagers turning into hoodlums has only begun to heat up, and already
someone's made a movie about it, and it's not, thank God, a tragic
account of a family ripped apart by the effect violence in films had on
a teenage boy. Instead we get a sharp, biting satire that takes no
prisoners and leaves no conservative point of view unscathed.
Based on a popular (and controversial) cable tv show, South Park: Bigger
Longer and Uncut can finally break loose of the shackles placed on the
show by television restrictions and take bad taste to brand new heights.
The movie is about a group of kids who sneak into a Canadian R-rated
movie and learn some naughty words. When they exhibit their new
knowledge to their moms, they decide to "blame Canada," wage war against
the neighbor country and execute "Terrence and Phillip," the flatulent
actors in the obscene film. The kids form an alliance they name "La
Resistance" (with the accent on the third syllable of "Resistance") to
save their favorite thespians, in a hilarious spoof of (tribute to?) Les
Misérables.
In a subplot, one of the characters (Kenny, who else?) dies and goes to
hell where he meets Satan. Satan and Saddam Hussein are lovers, you see.
Satan is a benevolent soul, while our favorite Eastern ruler can only
think about sex. Apparently, too, if Terrence and Phillip are executed
it will be the final sign of the apocalypse and Satan can emerge from
the deepest bowels of the Underground Kingdom to rule the Earth.
Aside from being a brilliant satire, South Park is also an all-stops-out
musical, with unforgettable numbers like "Shut Your F***ing Face Uncle
F***er" and "Cartman's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Almost invariably it's
funny stuff: often juvenile but always funny. The same can be said for
the rest of the movie: it's intelligent but delivered in a sophomoric
manner (i.e. toilet humor, endless profanity, etc.). Not that there's
anything wrong with that: vulgarity, when done right, is my bag, baby.
Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the twenty-somethings behind the film and
the show, paint a bulls-eye on The Motion Picture Association of America
and proceed to be the first to start trying to hit it. Cruelly mocking
the fact that the MPAA's rating system will allegedly tolerate grotesque
violence as long as obscenities aren't uttered, the auteurs throw some
nasty one-liner insults their way. The ratings-a-plenty association
isn't the only target of this unsparing banter: people who favor
censoring movies over gun control are equally fair game, with the "Blame
Canada" plot being a not-so-cheap shot at them.
The distinctively low-tech "cardboard" animation is oddly effective,
even more so than the state of the art "Deep Canvas" technique aptly
demonstrated in the recent Tarzan. It's more pleasant to look at, less
intimidating up on the screen, and most importantly it doesn't detract
from the film's concept as much as Disney's admirably awe-inspiring work
does.
The show's popularity has been waning as of late, and perhaps this movie
is just the thing to boost its ratings. Perhaps not. Having seen the
show on numerous occasions, I can say that it's not nearly as smart or
as funny as this movie. The series may be better off simply continuing
on the big screen every couple years. Parker and Stone have outdone
themselves to the point where I am forced to ask: Must the show go on?

Review for Swordfish (2001)
 "I've heard that the best programmers in the world
can do this in 60 minutes. Unfortunately, I need
someone who can do it in 30 seconds. Go."
Starring Hugh Jackman, John Travolta, Halle Berry, Don
Cheadle. Directed by Dominic Sena. Rated R.
Swordfish begins as an involving heist/hacker thriller
and ends as a muddled, incoherent mess. The movie
ruins its interesting set-up and undermines it's
well-made action sequences by taking a twist too many.
It's full of actors and filmmakers who know what
they're doing, but they have dedicated themselves to
utter nonsense; even if it is, sometimes, guiltily
entertaining nonsense.
Right about here I would usually be giving the curious
among you the film's plot. I pause here, because I
don't know the film's plot. I can give you the set up:
Stanley Jobson (Hugh Jackman) is a world-class hacker
who has retired from the trade and now endures a
pathetic existence, living in a trailer and longing to
see his daughter, who was taken away from him by his
vindictive ex. One day, as he's hitting golf balls off
the top of his makeshift abode, a beautiful woman
(Halle Berry) comes to see him. Apparently, her boss
Gabriel (John Travolta), a rich supercriminal, has
heard tell of Stanley's skills and wants to meet with
him. Stanley goes through the motions, refusing her
left and right, but inevitably goes. It turns out that
Gabriel wants Stanley to help him in a glorified
high-tech bank robbery, for a hefty share of the
profits.
Does that sound like the plot? Like I said, it's only
the set-up, and it's the only part of the movie that's
comprehensible or entertaining. Director Dominic Sena,
incompetent behind the camera of last year's Gone in
60 Seconds, here shows some flair for chase scenes and
action set pieces (the movie's money shot, in which a
camera slowly spins 360 degrees around an explosion in
slow motion, is almost worth the price of admission).
And Travolta, who hasn't made a good movie since A
Civil Action, still knows how to entertain; his
Gabriel is a fun villain for the film's first half.
And then someone decided that Swordfish needed to be
clever. Let's get something straight: well-executed,
competent genre movies are in just as short a supply
as genuinely original alternatives, and it's no shame
to make one of the former if the latter is beyond
one's reach (director Jonathan Mostow, he of Breakdown
and U-571, is building a solid reputation doing
exactly that). This might have been a wonderful movie
had it simply settled down and gotten itself
organized. If you can't execute a good plot twist,
don't do it.
Swordfish doesn't heed that advice. The good guys and
the bad guys switch places at least 526 times, and
after a while I gave up keeping track of who's who.
The ending itself is a total head-scratcher; I don't
want to give it away for those who somehow stay with
the movie, but suffice it to say that a certain
character should have died but miraculously (and there
doesn't seem to be any other explanation) didn't.
What the hell is the problem with a perfectly decent
heist movie? All the ingredients are here, but
Swordfish dumps half of them out. If you see it, see
it for Travolta, who goes back to being a "serious"
actor later this year with some sort of
child-in-jeopardy thriller, and feel free to leave
early. 

Title
Review for Rat Race (2001)
Starring Seth Green, Cuba Gooding Jr., Breckin Meyer,
Amy Smart, Jon Lovitz, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan
Atkinson, Kathy Najimy, John Cleese, Vince Vieluf.
Directed by Jerry Zucker. Rated PG-13.
Watching Rat Race is like being invited to a big
party. There is so much glee in this infectious,
embarassingly fun farce that even the most cynical
will find themselves happily jumping on the bandwagon.
The film shames American Pie 2, which thought that
vulgarity was the end-all to comedy. In the
August-September movie doldrums, a notorious dumping
ground for studios with movies to get rid of, Rat Race
is a triumph of irreverence.
The movie has a great basic foundation: rich people
are really, really bored. The richest in the world are
willing to throw away money just for a quick day's
entertainment. Casino owner Donald Sinclair (John
Cleese) smartly latches on to this concept and comes
up with a game for the obscenely wealthy to play. He
will collect a group of people, divide them into teams
and give each team a key to a locker somewhere in New
Mexico, tell them that it contains two million dollars
and say the word "go." What better way to whittle away
time than bet on a human horse race where the
specimens actually want to reach the finish line?
The teams are Duane and Blaine Cody (Seth Green and
Vince Vieluf), brothers who have no conscience or
scruples; Vera and Merrill (Whoopi Goldberg and Lanei
Chapman), a recently reunited mother and daughter;
Nick and Tracy (Breckin Meyer and Amy Smart), an
aspiring politician and a helicopter pilot; Randy Pear
(Jon Lovitz) and his Perfectly Average in Every Way
Family; Owen Templeton (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a
nationally humiliated football referee; and Enrico
(Rowan Atkinson), a narcoleptic Italian.
There is no real plot or story behind the skeleton
that gets the movie from A to B, but it works even
better as a series of hilarious, old-fashioned comedy
vignettes. Director Jerry Zucker, who is responsible
for what may be the most consistently funny movie ever
(Airplane), really lets loose, which no self-aware,
pop-culture-minded director would permit himself to
do. Where most movies deteriorate into simple chaos,
this one evolves into precise, thought-out, organized
chaos that never runs out of steam.
By the time the climax rolls around, greed has
completely taken over these characters, who have
abandoned any other life ambitions and aspirations
they may have had to get to that damn locker. The
denoument, which is a complete reversal of this, is
somewhat disappointing, but the journey there is one
delight on top of another. Suffice it to say that
Duane and Blaine wind up hanging off of a hot-air
balloon with a live cow, Templeton is chased by a mob
of Lucille Ball impersonators, the Pears drive
Hitler's car to a World War II Veterans Club meeting
and Vera and Merrill get punished for not purchasing a
squirrel. These scenes aren't expected to be funny on
their own merits (though they are), which is a mistake
a lot of films make; instead, Zucker puts them all
into brilliant context. I may not have believed it,
but I did laugh.
People undervalue the sophistication of this movie and
ones like it. To make a comedy, no matter how "dumb,"
that's timed so perfectly and works so effortlessly is
a deceptively difficult endeavor. Zucker is back, and
it's about time.

Review for Life (1999)
Starring Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence. Rated R.
When comics can restrain themselves, heaps of good can come of it. Billy
Crystal gave one of the best performances of his career in the recent Analyze
This all because he acted like a normal person. Adam Sandler's The Wedding
Singer was a gem because Sandler was sweet and gentle instead of maniacal and
repulsive. In the new prison dramedy Life we have two top notch comics, Eddie
Murphy and Martin Lawrence One of them restrains himself and the other goes
all out. Guess which one of tem succeeds.
Life tracks the lives of two people as they enter a Mississippi penetentiary
(sentenced to life in prison) for a crime they didn't commit. Ray (Eddie
Murphy) was a happy-go-lucky bootlegger, smuggling alcohol during the time of
prohibition. The other one, Claude (Martin Lawrence) is a relatively normal
guy, who plans to start a new job and a family. Of course, both of their
plans are shattered when a sheriff frames them for the murder of a poker
hustler.
The film spans their lives from 1932 to 1998, including their repeated
attempts to escape, their bickering and their fighting. By the end of the
movie we almost have an African American Grumpy Old Men. Not that there's
anything wrong with that because much of it is often very funny, in an almost
improvisational style.
Eddie Murphy is ordinarily goofy as Ray, over-the-top and sometimes annoying.
Eddie Murphy is Eddie Murphy. There is nothing outstanding in his
performance, although he is funny as much as he always is. Martin Lawrence,
on the other hand, shines. If you've ever seen his dismal tv show Martin, you
know that he is a talented, but a "Jim Carrey Type" comic. Thus many times he
fails to entertain because he does to his scripts what God never meant for
him to do. In Life, however, he restrains himself enough to be hilarious but
at the same time real. This is essential because Life is not completely a
comedy. It is a drama, too; sentimental and poignant with very subtle but
effective social commentary. Director Ted Demme, working from a script by
Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone is not afraid to stray from the teen movie
that the trailers may lead you to believe Life is. The commentary, mostly on
racism as well as the criminal justice system, here is prevalent enough to be
obvious but subtle enough not to be preachy.
Life bears fleeting similarities to The Shawshank Redemption as well as some
other Eddie Murphy movies such as The Nutty Professor. It's as funny as the
latter (which was overrated anyway), thanks to the chemistry between Lawrence
and Murphy. At the risk of sounding redundant, Life is beautiful.

Review for Cookie's Fortune (1999)
Cookie's Fortune (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/cookiesfortune.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
 Starring Glenn Close, Julianne Moore, Liv Tyler, Chris O'Donnell, Charles S.
Dutton. Rated PG-13.
Robert Altman's Cookie's Fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on
sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good. It is a
sunny, delightful, dreamy comedy, filled with lovely performances, skillful
direction and topped off with an understated, clever, extraordinary script.
As this is an ensemble piece, it is forced to start of slowly as it
introduces us to its characters, all of them residing in a southern town
called Holly Springs. First we meet Willie (Charles S. Dutton), an honest man
with a slight drinking habit. We then see that Willie takes care of an
elderly lady nicknamed Cookie, who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is
being filled with loneliness, despair, and want of her dead husband. We cut
to Camille (Glenn Close) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister
Cora (Julianne Moore). Then we briefly get acquainted with Emma (Liv Tyler),
an apparent relative of Cookie, who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast, still
full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live. We also
fleetingly see Emma's lover Jason (Chris O'Donnell), an ambitious but far too
excitable young cop.
We are now about one quarter through the two hour picture, and Robert Altman
decides that it is time to set the plot in motion. We see the ecstatic Cookie
stare hopefully at a picture of her husband. She exclaims "Here I Come!" and
then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself. Soon after, her niece
Camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl, comes upstairs, finds Cookie dead
and flips out. Convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have
none of that in her family, she eats the suicide note and convinces her
slightly slow (yet sweet) sister that it was a murder. She makes sure that
she stages it like a murder as well; scattering jewelry all over the floor,
breaking a few cabinets, windows and doors, and then throwing the gun out in
the back yard.
The only reasonable suspect is Willie, who immediately gets taken into
custody, and put in a jail cell (they all know he didn't do it, so the cell
stays open and he plays Scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful Emma).
Meanwhile, the unperturbed Camille continues her none-too-subtle
manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same
time making her Easter play a success.
So begins Cookie's Fortune, a film aptly described by critic Scott Renshaw as
"a southern spin on Fargo," except that this one is far funnier and much more
enjoyable than the Coen brothers' darker, somewhat disturbing and slightly
overrated escapade. Robert Altman's slight picture is in some ways
reminiscent of something like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil as
well, in that both films focus (on and off) on the eccentricities of the
residents in a southern US town. Indeed, most of the characters in Cookie's
Fortune are loads of fun to observe, and a portion of them are fascinating
and surprisingly multi- dimensional.
Glenn Close turns in an insubstantial (in terms of her career) but
magnificent performance as the conniving Camille and is also the source of a
good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie, and she is
perfectly cast as the prolific "Aunt Alexandria" character, endlessly
obsessed with family dignity. The equally essential role of Willie is handled
with an intangible grace by veteran thespian Charles S. Dutton (Mimic, A Time
to Kill)
There is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy
inside hours, even days after the film ends. Cookie's Fortune is such a
movie. I loved the light, kindhearted approach Altman (whose last project was
the dark, intense drama The Gingerbread Man) took towards the tricky subject
matter. I enjoyed the talented ensemble cast. I even liked the trite "In the
south everybody is related to everybody" cliche that is inevitably employed
by the time this movie draws to a close. I'm not sure why Cookie's Fortune
had such an all-around pleasing effect on me. Perhaps it's that good ol'
southern charm.

Review for Legally Blonde (2001)
"I even got a Coppola to direct my admissions video!"
Starring Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair,
Holland Taylor, Matthew Davis, Victor Garber, Jennifer
Coolidge. Directed by Robert Luketic. Rated PG-13.
Blondes may have more fun, but not if they're stuck
watching Legally Blonde, a mostly witless comedy that
is blessed with Reese Witherspoon. It's a
featherweight romp that wants to flaunt stereotypes
but instead winds up reaffirming them. Hovering
somewhere between outright silliness and heavy-handed
moralizing, the movie never decides where it wants to
go or what it wants to be. This middle-of-the-road
indecision keeps the farce firmly on the ground when
it should be taking off.
Elle Woods (Witherspoon) is your classic, ditzy,
stereotypical blonde. She has a 4.0 GPA in beauty
school, spends her time reading fashion magazines and
talking movie stars out buying "truly hideous angora
sweaters." Her boyfriend, on the other hand, comes
from an established family of congressman, and wants
to be one himself. He dumps poor Elle because he needs
someone "serious," even if they have no fashion sense.
Elle does not understand what it is about her that
isn't "serious." Then she sees an article in a
magazine and it comes to her: the love of her life
doesn't want a fashion maven, he wants a law student!
So she hits the books, takes the College Boards, gets
"a Coppola" to direct her admissions video and voila!
-- in the mail comes an acceptance letter from
Harvard. If only it was actually that easy...
For a while, the movie coasts on Witherspoon's
charisma and the inherent charm of the
Clueless-goes-to-Harvard scenario. The brilliant
Holland Taylor shows up as a tough law professor,
immediately livening up the proceedings, and Elle's
battle with the snobby Harvard types is amusing, if
never brilliant (although the irony of Elle's own
snobbishness, one much more egregious and less
deserved, irked me). When Elle gets assigned to a
murder case involving a fitness guru and takes all
kinds of bizarre initiatives and learns all kinds of
unwanted "lessons," Legally Blonde loses its bounce.
The final courtroom scenes, in particular, are
counterproductive. Not only are they unfunny, easily
the least clever section on the script, but they
undermine the film's admirable, if unnecessary, "open
mind" message. I was troubled by how Elle was shown to
be incompetent in everything except fashion, fitness
and hair perms. The movie wants us to accept her as
sharp and intelligent, but prods us to laugh at her at
the same time. Mainstream filmmakers -- or maybe their
financiers -- always try to make movies that are all
things to all people, and it invariably blows up in
their faces.
What's worse, Legally Blonde doesn't have a sense of
the ridiculous. You can feel director Robert Luketic
trying in the courtroom scenes, but something always
stops him from delving into the truly madcap. Thus we
have time to question the movie and ponder its logic,
something that should never happen in a movie as
profoundly silly as this.
Witherspoon is a great actress, here playing the
opposite of her Tracy Flick character in the
infinitely superior Election. The movie's failure is
not hers but the script's, which chooses the
well-trodden path at every fork in the road, and
sometimes even tries to take both paths at once. The
Chihuahua is cute, though.

Review for Shuang long hui (1992)
Twin Dragons (1992/1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/twindragons.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Jackie Chan, Maggie Cheung, Teddy Robin Kwan. Rated PG-13.
I've always been a sucker for Jackie Chan, the limitlessly energetic martial
arts star who has in the past couple years established a fan following as
well as a solid film presence in the US. His recent films have been of widely
varied quality; Mr. Nice Guy didn't cut it but Rush Hour, with Chris Tucker,
was a delight. And with the success of the latter film, it comes as no
surprise that Hollywood is bringing back one of Jackie Chan's older films,
made in his native country.
Released in Japan in 1992 under the title Shuang long hui, Twin Dragons is,
like most of his other films, just as much of a comedic endeavor as it is a
martial arts one. It has Chan in a dual role; he plays Boomer, a
mechanic/martial artist as well as Mr. Mah, a maestro and musician. Boomer
and his pal Tyson are running away from some thugs that want $300,000 that
they won from them in a bet; money that neither of them happen to have.
Meanwhile, Mr. Mah prepares for a big concert.
Well it just so happens that the twins, separated at birth, are somehow linked
so that when Mah plays the piano, Boomer's hand starts to move as if he was
playing the piano, and when Boomer is on a boat, Mah acts like he is on a wild
boat ride, etc. This mysterious connection, of course, becomes useful when the
two meet up and go to rescue Tyson from the thugs that kidnapped him.
Those that found the Japanese Godzilla movies with bad dubbing charming will
certainly enjoy poking fun at this abysmally voiced adventure, where you can
almost see the dubbers struggling to do the voiceover correctly. Still,
although the dubbing is incoherent and the plotting nonsensical (the
telepathic link part makes no sense and the thugs are awful villains), Twin
Dragons is lots of fun, not only because of Chan's relentlessly amazing
stunts but also because of his comedic skills. There are some hilarious
scenes in what is essentially a mistaken identity caper, most of them
involving trying to hide one of the twins from an unsuspecting supporting
character who just happens to be walking in at that moment.
Twin Dragons was successfully preempted by Jean-Claude Van Damme and his
Double Impact, which, incidentally, was the only Claude movie I really liked.
That doesn't render Twin Dragons worthless because there's certainly some fun
to be had with good ol' Jackie Chan and some humorously self-effacing
co-stars. The climax and ending are a mess, but some individual parts are
quite funny, and I couldn't help but enjoy the movie as a whole.
It is worthwhile to note, however, that despite the enjoyably hokey
screenplay, this is a rather poorly made, low-budget film. The effect of two
Chans on the same screen is abysmal, and some special effects (such as rigs
and wires) are botched as well. Whether this takes away from enjoyment of the
picture is up to the individual, but it never helps.
Despite the fact that Chan is 45 years of age, it isn't unreasonable to
assume that with his popularity, he'll stick around for a while, both in the
US and in Japan. I never get tired of watching him perform, he is adorable,
charming, and very, very cool.

Review for Stuart Little (1999)
 Starring Jonathan Lipnicki, Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie. Featuring the
voice talents of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, Chad Palminteri, Steve
Zahn. Directed by Rob Minkoff. Rated PG.
Stuart Little is a wonderful movie, one of the year's best live action
family offerings and a great example of non-intrusive CGI. It's a fairy
tale from beginning to end, a story where logic is as irrelevant as in
Cinderella or in Little Red Riding Hood. E.B. White, who wrote the
beloved children's book on which this delightful yarn is based, was
clearly concerned with creating a world completely different from the
one we live in, and Rob Minkoff's movie succeeds in recreating White's
(who also wrote Charlotte's Web) vision.
The movie opens on the day when George Little's parents (Geena Davis
and Hugh Laurie; George himself is played by Jonathan "The Human Head
Weighs Eight Pounds" Lipnicki) are supposed to visit the local
orphanage and adopt a little brother for him. He's unabashedly excited,
but his bubble is burst when, upon his arrival home from school, he
finds that Mr. and Mrs. Little have adopted not a little boy, but
Stuart, a little homeless mouse. Stuart is voiced by that great animal
impersonator Michael J. Fox (see the Homeward Bound movies) and is one
talkative rodent.
Mr. and Mrs. Little treat Stuart as a beloved member of the family;
unfortunately, George refuses at first to accept a mouse as a brother
and the family cat, Snowbell, has an unreserved contempt for the thing.
Since Stuart is a member of the family, he is a mouse with a pet cat: a
fact very damaging to Snowbell's pride. In a daring, surprising plot
twist, the feline enlists the help of some cat gangsters to take Stuart
out of the picture.
Meanwhile, Stuart earns George's affections by helping him win a
miniature sailing race. From that point on, George accepts Stuart as a
brother and is horrified when he is taken away from him by a pair of
mice who may or may not be Stuart's real parents.
Stuart Little's chief delight is perhaps the extraordinarily witty
script written by the noveau riche The Sixth Sense scribe M. Night
Shyamalan. Not only is it chock full of awesome one-liners ("Didn't
your mother ever tell you not to go into Central Park at night?" "My
mother was the reason you didn't go into Central Park at night!") but
is also strikingly well-done; sentimental but not gooey, reasonably
complex but not convoluted.
The film's gimmick (for want of a better word) is that nobody in it is
one bit surprised to see a mouse that talks and walks upright. Nor does
anyone really question the Littles' decision to adopt a rodent, beyond
a cautionary "Inter-species adoptions tend not to work out." This helps
to create the impression that the events in the film are occuring in a
world nothing like our own. Stuart Little is similar to efforts like
Babe: Pig in the City in its creation of an enchanting parallel
universe.
Jonathan Lipnicki has not quite outgrown his cuteness, though he's damn
close to it, and he turns in a more than serviceable performance. The
role is a non-demanding one, but the kid handles it admirably; he's
appealing but not too cloying. Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie don't get to
actually act much as the parents, but they are effective in a cheesy
Brady Bunch sort of way. Michael J. Fox gives a great voiceover
performance as Stuart, really establishing the animal as a character;
making him a likable screen presence.
I really enjoyed Stuart Little. I think kids will get a kick out of it
and adults will like it just as much. It really is good: smart, clever,
funny, extremely entertaining; if not terribly profound. This is
one "boy and his [insert name of pet animal here]" story that's worth
checking out.

Title
Review for Nouvelle Čve, La (1999)
Starring Karin Viard, Pierre-Loup Rajot, Catherine Frot, Sergi Lopez.
Directed by Catherine Corsini. Unrated (would be a strong R for sex and
profanity).
I've been horribly dilatory in catching up with the best of French
cinema; as such, my experience with the nation's impressive film
history is limited to the most populist entries. I keep promising
myself that I'll get to it but it never seems to happen. In any event,
I seriously doubt that Catherine Corsini's The New Eve (La Nouvelle
Eve) will be considered a masterpiece by anyone, though it is a worthy
effort. It's sometimes rambling, sometimes incoherent but also
sporadically insightful. This won't be a blockbuster.
When we're introduced to Camille, she is a pseudo-independent club
hopper, having sex with strange men, regularly taking various mind-
altering substances, partying with a lesbian couple and earning
derision from her family, including her married brother whose wife is
expecting a baby. A subtly presented "afraid of commitment" cliche,
Camille refuses to get into a serious relationship with anyone.
That all changes when she meets Alexis (Pierre-Loup Rajot). She quickly
falls in love with him, before she has a chance to find out that he is
a married father of two and a serious political activist. Everybody
tells her that chasing a married man is pure masochism and bound to
lead to no good, she goes after Alexis anyway. Luckily for her, Alexis
doesn't put up too much of a fight -- his resistance amounts to "I
can't. No, really, I can't. Seriously, this isn't a good idea. Ok,
fine" -- and they start an affair.
Suddenly, after the two spend a weekend together away from the wife,
Alexis's wimps out. He says that he can't, in good conscience, continue
this relationship and keep his wife in the dark. Confused, heart-broken
and frightened, Camille reverts to her old ways, nearly killing herself
in the process.
The New Eve hardly ever tests our patience. Though it has a tendency to
overstate some of its points, the 94 minutes go by reasonably quickly.
Karin Viard gives a discovery of a performance; her desperation is
painfully palpable and when she is happy, so are we. She also involves
us in her character -- at about the halfway point I realized that I was
genuinely interested in what was going to happen to this person in the
end. The film sets up its conflict so carefully that the outcome is
difficult to predict.
Where the movie goes wrong is its pacing. The film lingers on certain
plot points longer than we'd like it to but other events go by so fast
that it becomes hard to follow. I think that at one point I actually
missed the protagonist getting married. Crucial scenes are rushed
through while inconsequentials are emphasized (instead of the lengthy,
pointless post-coitus conversation, for example, the film could have
used more exposition).
The movie's ending is bizarre and more than a little confusing, though
certainly open to interpretation. It's so open to interpretation, as a
matter of fact, that it muddles the movie's actual point, leaving us to
debate amongst ourselves whether The New Eve was actually trying to say
something with its denoument or just to catch us off-guard. Is that a
good thing? Well, whatever floats your boat.

Title
Review for Bicentennial Man (1999)
Starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill. Directed by Chris
Columbus. Rated PG.
Chris Columbus is master of melodrama, sire of schmaltz and czar of
cheapness. His films are notorious sentimental hanky-fests. Stepmom, in
particular, comes to mind, but each of his films, from Mrs. Doubtfire
to Home Alone have those infamous moments of ultra-sentimental emotion.
Many have labeled Columbus's movies as cheap and false, and they may be
right, but his new one, Bicentennial Man is different. Somehow, the
emotion in this one is genuine and the movie works: as a tearjerker, as
family entertainment and as a comedy.
Robin Williams, who hasn't done an all-out comedy since the abominable
Flubber and hasn't made a good one since Columbus's Nine Months, stars
here as Andrew, a domestic robot owned by a kindly 2005 family. The
head of the family (Sam Neill), known only as "Sir" since that's what
Andrew calls him, begins to notice something unique about his household
appliance. He takes Andrew to his parent company which wants
to "correct the defect." They go away and Sir takes on Andrew's
education himself, feeling the responsibility to help the robot grow to
bigger and better things.
Andrew himself has grown fond of Sir's youngest daughter, "Little
Miss," who befriends him. Their relationship develops for fifteen years
until Andrew, now officially an enlightened robot (as well as an expert
clock-maker), asks for his freedom. Sir gets PO-ed at Andrew's alleged
ungratefulness and, in essense, kicks him out, with a self-
righteous "You now have your freedom." So Andrew goes off and builds a
house of his own on the oceanside, where Little Miss can come to visit
him as often as she likes.
After Sir's death, Andrew feels something missing from his "life," so
he goes on a twenty year journey to seek out other robots like him.
What he finds is a robot scientist (the dependable Oliver Platt) who
helps him take on human form. But can he actually become a human and
obtain all the privileges that go with it, like the ability to marry a
human?
Bicentennial Man was based on a pair of short stories by renowned sci-
fi writer Isaac Asimov but it was, of course, altered to be more crowd-
pleasing and mainstream. The result is hardly ground-breaking cinema,
but it's watchable, touching, profound and sometimes downright
allegorical. Granted, it occasionally has over-sentimental and cloying
moments Chris Columbus-style, but they feel marginally genuine: things
real people might say or do. I'm still not sold on Columbus's often
condescending style of filmmaking, but at least he's heading in the
right direction.
I liked Robin Williams here too; his purpose, for once, isn't sucking
up to the audience. His performance is quirky, funny and sincere; not
his best, but a lot of fun to watch. I also enjoyed Oliver Platt, whose
hilarious deadpan delivery is impossible to get tired of. This isn't an
actors' movie: the performances are often overshadowed by the flashy,
though not spectacular special effects. The animatronics and CGI used
to create the robot are just as smooth and aesthetically flawless as
the performances. This is, after all, a 100 million dollar movie: the A-
List stars are here, but they are not alone.
There is, of course, a final "inspirational" speech and it's in a
courtroom, of sorts. I dread that family movie staple. But in
Bicentennial Man it is kept concise and to the point -- definitely a
plus. Most importantly, though, the speech doesn't make you cringe. It
actually means something. It's well-written and well-delivered. It
doesn't always follow the formula.
As some critics have pointed out, this plot has been done before, and
sometimes better, on the tv series Star Trek: The Next Generation,
where "Data," an android, was on a constant quest to become as human as
possible. True, there are similarities -- ah hell, it's exactly the
same thing -- but it's unfair to penalize Bicentennial Man for it.
There was more than enough room for two falling meteor flicks (Deep
Impact and Armageddon) as well as two computer-animated movies about
ants (Antz and A Bug's Life) all in the same year, so why cripe about
something that's not nearly as conspicuous?
A couple of final quibbles: I'm now offering a substantial reward for
James Horner's severed head on a stick. The whole movie, I was wishing
he would shut up. The Oscar-winning composer's music here is god-awful,
with "tender" violin compositions playing ceaselessly in the
background, telling us exactly how to feel about the events on screen.
Also, at 2 hours 11 minutes, Bicentennial Man is a little on the long
side, but then again with the streak of 3-hour-plus Oscar contenders
being released in these next few months, I guess I shouldn't complain.
Bicentennial Man is well-worth a look this holiday season, especially
if your other choice is something like Anna and the King which, I hope,
leaves theaters in a hurry. This isn't a perfect movie, but it
entertains and touches the heart, and it's certainly a big step up from
Patch Adams.

Title
Review for Trekkies (1997)
I wonder if the majority of Star Trek fans have an intense dislike for
Star Wars. Those Star Wars fanatics have been labeled as the most daring
and the most idolatrous of them all, mainly because of their standing in
line for months to see The Phantom Menace when in reality they can't
hold a figurine up to some Trek followers, often referred to as
Trekkies. Trekkies, the new documentary from Paramount, which ironically
is the studio responsible for Star Trek, brings us an account of this
devoted group of Trek enthusiasts.
Trekkies narrated by Denise Crosby, an actress on Star Trek: The Next
Generation, and what the film does is take a rather random approach in
portraying and profiling die-hard Trekkers. There is a woman who showed
up for jury duty in her Star Trek uniform, saying that she did it
because she doesn't "want any of [her] officers to ever be ashamed of
wearing their uniforms." I searched in vain for any hint of a smirk,
some sign that she really is not serious about all this. There was none.
Star Trek is her world, her whole existence.
Another major focus point of the film is a family of Trekkies, a father
a mother and two children. The father is a dentist. Their office is all
Trek. Everywhere you look you see Star Trek memorabilia, the
secretaries, the nurses and the doctors all wear Trek uniforms (of
course, if I walked into a dentist's office where the doctor was dressed
up as a starship captain I'd run as fast as I could, but then that's
just me).
Director Roger Nygard does not water down this movie one bit, and it
features fans as outrageous as fans get. That is deceptively daring
because nobody expected Paramount to come out with a movie that portrays
trekkies in all their glory and wackiness. And, indeed, Trekkies is
often times riotously funny, though it is unclear whether we are
actually laughing with these people or at them.
The question is whether these hard-core trekkies are worthy of our
derision and our mockery. Alas, they're not. I looked at them, and I did
not see freaks. I saw families and societies coming together in harmony
to participate in something that is of mutual interest. At the risk of
sounding hackneyed, isn't it a hell of a lot better for kids to be going
to Star Trek conventions and sewing Trek uniforms than building bombs?
Those that tell these people to "get a life" are promoting a double
standard, especially as far as the children are concerned. For years, I
have heard society insist that if children got involved in inoffensive,
social activites rather than making trouble the world would be a better
place. Telling these "trekkie kids" to "get a life" is, then, a
contradiction.
I am myself a passive Trek fan, although I don't consider myself a
trekkie. Watching Trekkies, I did not feeling smug or conceited. If
nothing else, I was felt left out.

Review for Astronaut's Wife, The (1999)
"What happened during those two minutes?"
Starring Charlize Theron, Johnny Depp. Rated R.
In many ways, The Astronaut's Wife is a very decent Hollywood thriller.
It is utterly compelling for most, if not all of its running time;
intense and well acted, moments had me on the edge of my seat. So it is
only in retrospect that I was able to discern its many prevalent
inadequacies. As the story unspools the film seems to work but after it
is over you realize that cerebrally The Astronaut's Wife did not begin
to live up to its admittedly impressive visceral effect.
Jillian Armicaust's husband, Spencer (stoic Johnny Depp), is the
respected commander of a space shuttle. On his latest mission there is
an accident. As Spencer and his partner are trying to fix a satellite
there is an explosion. Houston (we have a problem) loses contact with
the two austronauts for two whole minutes. When communication is
regained they are immediately brought back to Earth. Spencer seems fine
but his partner has a massive stroke and dies.
Soon Charlize is pregnant with twins. It is then that she begins to
notice strange things about her husband. Nothing apparent, but little
things that are off. At first she pays no mind, and when a concerned,
fired NASA official comes to her claiming that there was something very
odd about those two minutes alone in space she shoos him off, in obvious
denial. But then she realizes that something is very wrong and begins to
suspect that there is something in those mysterious two minutes, in her
husband and inside her that may not be of this earth.
As I ran the scenes over in my head after the movie I got the feeling
that Ravich was afraid of getting caught on a plot contradiction and
decides to prevent that by being as neutral as possible. He suggests
things about the nature of the aliens but he never develops the
concepts. He gives clues but he never provides specifics. Not only is
this frustrating to the viewer, not only does it detract from the movie,
but it's also a sign of laziness on the part of the writer.
Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate, Mighty Joe Young) is a
magnificent actress, and she is terrific in The Astronaut's Wife. In a
role that could have easily been played over-the-top B-movie style,
Theron maintains her dignity throughout and delivers an intense,
satisfying performance. Johnny Depp fares just as well. Towards the
climax where it would have been easy, once again, to overact and make
his character cheesy he remains calmly menacing; clearly a force to be
reckoned with.
We never get to know Spencer before the change so it's hard for us to
compare them, which is another thing detracting from the movie. How are
we supposed to believe everyone who insists that there's something wrong
with him when we don't know what he's like when there isn't anything
wrong? That's a fundamental problem; a flaw in the film's very structure
and one that would have been corrected had anyone involved in the making
of this film used his common sense.
Despite its many detriments, The Astronaut's Wife is still a moderately
satisfying affair. It's the kind of film that I generally tend to like;
the kind where quiet intensity rather than cheap thrills is what engages
the audience. This particular film is often quite effective as far as
adrenaline is concerned but it quickly falls apart if you try and
actually think about what just went on.
I'm not sure if I can come out and recommend The Astronaut's Wife to
you, but if you do decide to see it I doubt you'll feel like you wasted
your money. I didn't like this movie but I can't say that it
disappointed me either. It's certainly not bad; it's just a shame that
it isn't better.

Review for Erin Brockovich (2000)
 Starring Julia Roberts, Albert Finney, Aaron Eckhart. Directed by
Steven Soderbergh. Rated R.
Even if the movie itself is a bit lackluster, Erin Brockovich will
stick in my mind as one of exceedingly few movies where Julia Roberts
doesn't play Julia Roberts. It hasn't happened since 1997's wonderful
Conspiracy Theory. Everywhere else, she's played the same role, the
unsure-of-what-she-wants romantic role model. She has a distinctive
romantic relationship here too, but at least she gets to spout some
entertainingly fiery monologues while she's at it. Too bad the movie
gets bogged down in a trite legal plot rather than explore her
interesting character further.
The title character is a twice-divorced, uneducated, unemployed woman,
taking care of three young children while trying to keep herself from
starving. She's desperately running all around L.A. looking for a job --
 something, anything -- but is turned down everywhere she goes because
of her lack of schooling and expertise. But finally, via a string of
good luck (and perseverance), Erin gets a position as a clerk in a
small law firm.
Her boss, an elderly lawyer named Ed Masry played by the inimitable
Albert Finney, is often taken aback by Erin's overtly aggressive
nature. She gets into fights with the staff, insults his ties and he's
ready to fire her. But then she goes off on a tangent, to investigate a
real estate case that, for some reason, has bloodwork and medical
records mixed in. She soon finds that an evil utility company
named "PG&E" is contaminating a town's drinking water with inordinate
amounts of hexavalent chromium, a poisonous, carcinogenic substance
that's not supposed to be in tap water under any circumstances.
Needless to say, all of the town's residents are seriously affected,
with medical bills starting to skyrocket. So Erin, the gentle soul that
she is, convinces her boss to take on this giant class-action suit,
which may be a serious risk for good old Ed, since it requires a lot of
time and money but does not guarantee a positive outcome. Meanwhile,
Erin herself developed a relationship with an unusually kindly,
unemployed biker dude (Aaron Eckhart) who takes care of her kids when
she's at work, but the arrangement is on thin ice because she is hardly
ever home anymore...
The first half if this movie jumps off the screen at you. Julia Roberts
is riveting as a street-smart, desperate woman struggling to survive in
a big city. Her story is interesting, compulsively watchable.
Immediately, she seems like a woman I'd love to spend the next two and
a half hours with. This blissful state continues for a half an hour or
so. But director Steven Soderbergh and writer Susannah Grant aren't at
all interested in keeping it that way. It's downhill from there.
The turning point, of course, is when the characters get mixed up in
the legal matter. This shifts Erin Bronkovich's focus -- how could it
not -- and it becomes a moderately entertaining but painfully ordinary
Grishamesque legal drama. The movie manages to pause and actually
examine what's happening to this person I got so attached to in the
first half hour precious few times. Hexavalent chromium has completely
taken over and the film isn't as interesting anymore.
Ironically, though the lawsuit plot takes up most of Erin Bronkovich's
running time, it seems almost like an afterthought, something put in to
entertain the lowest common denominator because the masses presumably
wouldn't be interested in just the person (what destroys this argument
is that the film is actually a true story, but for cinematic purposes
I'm going to cheerfully ignore that fact). It's a shame that a
personality so decidedly unique had to be diluted with a storyline so
trite.
What really pulls you through it, in the end, is the performances.
Julia Roberts remains tremendously entertaining, spouting harsh, loud
monologues right up until the credits. Few can outshout Roberts. Albert
Finney, a four-time Oscar nominee steals a lot of the scenes he is in.
He has the perfect combination of grumpiness and amiability that's
often difficult to concoct. It helps that he is given some downright
hilarious lines.
Those who watch Erin Brockovich might remember last year's terrific
John Travolta drama A Civil Action, which was also about a lawyer
helping a town with poisoned water. The difference betwene the two was
that in Civil Action, the legal matter was its driving force. It was
the centerpiece and the rest of the plot revolved around it. The
trouble with Erin Brockovich is that the character is the centerpiece
and the lawsuit takes our attention away from it.

Review for Stop Making Sense (1984)
Stop Making Sense (1984/1999 Rerelease)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/
Member: Online Film Critics Society
"Into the blue again/After the money's gone
Once in a lifetime/water flowing underground"
Starring David Byrne, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison, Steven Scales. Not
Rated (nothing offensive).
As music films go it seems to be an accepted fact that Stop Making Sense
is second to none. The Talking Heads concert film has been out of
circulation for a long time, but it is now getting a theatrical
rerelease on its 15th birthday. On a dazzling restored print it's all
the better: an electrifying rock experience. Jonathan Demme's (The
Silence of the Lambs) film has it all: great music given a backbone of
top-notch camerawork and editing.
The music is courtesy of Talking Heads, a popular Rock/New Wave band
evidently proclaimed by some to be the most influential of the 80s. Its
lead singer David Byrne is that rare breed: a stage presence both
enigmatic and energetic. Most of the fun of Stop Making Sense comes from
watching Byrne's on stage antics as he and his band jubilantly plow
through 15 of their own songs. The songs, I admit, are not all
superlative: some are redundant and others just didn't appeal to me, but
as a whole I was impressed with the Talking Heads' (whom I've never
heard before I first saw the original version of the film a couple years
ago, by the way) repertoire.
This is an unusual concert film. There are barely ever any audience
reaction shots or music video intercuts: the camera focuses solely on
the band. It's very much a better movie for it; these kinds of songs are
better watched than listened to and frequent cuts away from the action
would have heavily distracted from the kinetic performance the Talking
Heads put on. Jonathan Demme made sure the film would be pure with no
artificial tricks (now accepting thank-you notes for not saying
"flavors") by the camera or by anything else.
The highlight of the show is a number called "Once in a Lifetime".
Byrne, looking unnervingly like Gregory Peck in To Kill a Mockingbird,
sings the Talking Heads' most distinctive song; a hypnotic intercutting
of a wonderful melody and something I can only describe as chanting. The
lyrics, too, are something to think about. They come off as gibberish at
first but, like most of their work, after a little pondering, they begin
to make sense.
If I put in a CD and listened to the music of the Talking Heads for 90
minutes, I would be bored. If I watched a 90 minute Talking Heads music
video I would be bored. Stop Making Sense, while simple, enchanted me.
It's just like watching a concert, yes, but what a concert it is! I've
never seen a musical group put on a better show and I've never seen a
show's spirit captured better than this.
See it. See it now. See it while you have the benefit of the big screen
and the surround sound. See it while you have the opportunity to watch
it as it was meant to be, with a brand new, restored print. Don't let
the "concert film" idea throw you off; most "regular" films can only
dream of being as good as Stop Making Sense.

Review for Galaxy Quest (1999)
Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Daryl Mitchell, Tony Shalhoub,
Enrico Colantoni. Directed by Dean Parisot. Rated PG.
You'd think it would be easy to spoof Star Trek, but try spoofing it
without cruelly mocking it. That's a bit more difficult. The farfetched
sci-fi series is, after all, enormously popular, what with its gigantic
fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies. If
you're not nice to it, you lose. Galaxy Quest is to Star Trek what Mel
Brooks's Spaceballs was to Star Wars, an affectionate, riotously funny
parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but
never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned.
"The show's been cancelled, but the journey is far from over." That is
the current tagline of "Galaxy Quest," a Star Trek - type show that's
no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns. It also lives on in
conventions, gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to
dress in "Galaxy Quest" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions
about its delirious technobabble.
Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) played "Commander Peter Quincy Taggart" on
the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about
the gigs they have to do. The attitudes of the rest -- Tommy Webber
(Daryl Mitchell, Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver), Fred Kwan (Tony
Shalhoub) and Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) -- range from indifference
to utter contempt. Dane, who played a Spock-like alien, is especially
disgusted, considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly
refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line "By Grabthar's
Hammer, you shall be avenged" (or something like that) for his die-hard
fans.
One day, Nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "Galaxy
Quest" followers. They are actually aliens from a planet known as
Thermia. They have mistaken the "Galaxy Quest" episodes for historical
documentation of actual heroic space travel. The next day, the
Thermians whisk Nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the
evil Sarris (named, in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags, after
Village Voice film critic Andrew Sarris). Nesmith thinks it is only an
elaborate gig, and sort of blows it off, but when he is transported --
or I should say shot -- back to Earth in a rather celestial manner, he
believes.
Next thing the cast knows, they are being dragged by Nesmith to this
spaceship. Of course, they all think he is out of his mind and once he
does convince them that there really is a spaceship, what they want to
do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them. But
after some persuading, they stay on to fight the icky Sarris and find a
way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing Thermians.
I was quite surprised how well this comedy, which came off as utterly
brainless from its marketing campaign, worked. Taking shots at both the
obvious and not-so-obvious elements of Star Trek and its fandom, Galaxy
Quest never goes for cheap laughs, opting instead for broad but smart
parody. Nothing is safe -- not the cliches, not the fans, not the
absurd taglines -- but on the other hand, everything is safe, since
Galaxy Quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even
subtle admiration.
The highlight of the movie is Tony Shalhoub's Fred a.k.a. Tech Sergeant
Chen who, when in character, is the complete opposite of Scotty from
the original Star Trek. While Scotty, who was the technician for the
Enterprise would constantly yell "I NEED MORE POWER DOWN HERE
CAPTAIN!", Chen's cry for help is more to the tune of "The core, like,
won't take it or something." It's a hoot, but it doesn't stop there:
Weaver, whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the
computer says and Rickman, with his relentlessly holier-than-thou
attitude aren't far behind.
Galaxy Quest succeeds as a funny parody of Star Trek and while it's not
a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it
is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all
the sober Oscar contenders being released this holiday season. By
Grabthar's hammer, this is a hell of a movie.

Title
Review for Virgin Suicides, The (1999)
Starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, Josh Hartnett,
Hanna Hall, Chelse Swain, A.J. Cook, Leslie Hayman and the voice of
Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by Sofia Coppola. Rated R.
The Lisbon sisters enchanted the boys in the neighborhood. They toyed
with them, taunted them, tempted them and then just as the boys thought
that they were going to score, the girls committed suicide. Was this
all a cruel game they played, a last hurrah against the culture that
restricted them? Or was it a subconscious, desperate cry for help and
finally a release from a life they hated? Such is the difficult subject
matter of Sophia Coppola's powerful, confident directing debut entitled
The Virgin Suicides, a visually stunning, emotionally wrenching trip
through the dark side of 70's suburbia.
There were five of them: Lux (Kirsten Dunst), Cecilia (Hanna Hall),
Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Mary (A.J. Cook), Therese (Leslie Hayman).
Cecilia, the youngest, was the first to go. She tried to kill herself
by slitting her wrists in a bathtub; when that didn't work, she jumped
out of a window and landed directly on a spiked fence. Why she did what
she did is ambiguous. The mother (Kathleen Turner), a devoutly Catholic
woman who was paranoidly protective as it was, becomes even more
cautious. The dad (James Woods), a calm, reserved schoolteacher seems
to care less. In any event, the rest of the girls' lives are never the
same again.
Meanwhile, the boys gather at a house across the street and spy on the
Lisbon sisters through a telescope. They begin a collection of Lisbon
souvenirs -- diaries, clothes, hairpins, etc. When, on prom night, Lux
sleeps with the school rebel Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett) on the
football field, mommy goes mad and shuts the girls off from the world
completely. After hearing a church sermon, she makes Lux burn her rock
records. The sisters' only contact with other people is through cryptic
messages they and the boys send to each other until one night they
finally build up the courage to end it all.
The Virgin Suicides brings a new meaning to the age-old
complaint "Parents just don't understand." This is the '70's, after
all -- the "ME" decade -- where, thanks to the "hippie" counterculture,
teens began to be looked upon as something resembling the spawn of
Satan. It's understandable, then, why Mrs. Lisbon got the idea that the
best way to protect her daughters from the evils of the other teenagers
was to shut them off completely. This film has been attacked by the
Catholic League, who charge that the girls commit suicide because they
couldn't stand their Catholic upbringing. These are misguided
complaints -- Catholicism had little to do with it.
The story is told from the point of view of the boys by a sort of
collective narrator (Giovanni Ribisi, who never actually appears). We
see much of the events from the outside looking in. Watching the film
is a little bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. We're told very
little outright -- the boys concede that they could not even begin to
understand the complexity of the Lisbon sisters -- and are expected to
figure it out on our own. The film's ending, surprising despite its
inevitability, leaves a lot of room for debate.
Sofia Coppola, never quite able to hit it big as an actress despite the
prominence of her director father Francis Ford Coppola, shows great
promise behind the camera. She has a surprising visual flair: the
repeating shot of Lux's sad face translucently superimposed over a
picturesque grass field with beautiful sunny skies above is hypnotic
and strangely ominous. Her sparing use of camera tricks like split-
screen and slow motion turn out to have a haunting effect and the
film's bleak, cold color palette gives it an appropriately unrealistic,
isolated, out-of-touch look, perhaps mimicking the girls' feelings.
The Virgin Suicides is a spellbinding tale of pubescent discovery,
parental indifference the fundamental unfairness of the 1970's and the
power that childhood memories can hold. It's rich, poignant, rewarding
and ultimately unforgettable.

Review for Shanghai Noon (2000)
Starring Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu. Directed by Tom Dey. Rated
PG-13.
Now that Jackie Chan is officially in Hollywood, studio honchos seem
afraid of letting him carry a film, something that he has done
countless times in Hong Kong. His first two big American Event Movie
projects have both been buddy movies. The first, Rush Hour, saw him
paired with the fast-talking, very American Chris Tucker. The film
turned out to be one of the biggest hits of 1998, quickly making Chan a
hot commodity. Now, Tinseltown is hoping to repeat Rush Hour's success
with Shanghai Noon, an inconsistent western comedy that brings together
Chan and, oddly, Owen Wilson (a debatable move, since everyone confuses
him with brother Luke anyway). The film is somewhat insensitive and not
always as funny as you'd like, but it's still memorable for a couple of
standout scenes.
After Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu, in a token role) is kidnapped from
China's "Forbidden City," Chon Wang (pronounced almost like "John
Wayne," setting up a few cheap jokes), an imperial guard, is sent with
a group of four others to rescue her. Wang is separated from his
companions when a train robbery led by outlaw Roy (Wilson) goes wrong.
Wang finds himself in an Indian village where he unwittingly marries a
young, beautiful Indian girl. This fails to take his mind off his
mission and soon enough he partners with Roy, who agrees to help rescue
the Princess from an evil Chinese hostage-taker who wants a lot of
money from the Chinese government.
The four Chinesemen who came with Wang are carrying a lot of gold and,
of course, that's really what Roy is motivated by. Chon Wang is pure
and only wants to rescue his beloved princess. There's a veritable
subplot concerning whether Chon Wang can find the courage to abandon
his culture, disobey the Emperor's orders and Americanize himself that
left a sour taste in my mouth. I balked when some claimed that there
were racial stereotypes in The Phantom Menace, but if people get mad at
this one, I can at least see why.
One of Jackie Chan's dilemmas has often seemed to be whether to focus
more on the comedy or the eye-popping martial arts stunts -- he is
exceptionally talented at both. His best films are the ones that
balanced the two, neither upstaging the other. One of Shanghai Noon's
problems is that both seem to be diluted -- the action is abundant but
more cautious than Chan's other films and the laughs are, at best, on-
and-off.
The movie redeems itself with two gut-bustingly hilarious scenes, one
involving controlled substances at an Indian campfire and the other a
Chinese drinking game. These are two of the most memorable scenes of
the year; if more of the movie of the movie was like this, we would
have been looking at a comedic masterpiece. And then there is the
obligatory blooper reel just before the end credits roll which, not
surprisingly, turned out funnier than the rest of the film.
With Jackie Chan movies, it always comes back to this: almost anything
can be salvaged with the actor's charm. In the end, it's the actor's
effortless amiability that really saves Shanghai Noon. He's so good at
portraying a fish-out-of-water that he breathes new life into the
overdone isolated-foreigner-introduced-to-modern-society plot. It's a
shame that Hollywood is afraid to let Chan go it alone: he's not only a
great martial artist but he's a hell of an actor too. Owen Wilson,
meanwhile, is just alright.

Title
Review for Injong sajong polkot opta (1999)
Starring Joong-Hoon Park, Sung-Kee Ahn, Dong-Kun Jang. Directed by
Myung-se Lee. Not Rated (would be PG-13 or mild R).
...and the year's most visually exciting movie to date comes to us
from... South Korea? That's right, like Run Lola Run in 1999, the most
aesthetically unusual picture I've seen this year is not American. It's
called Nowhere to Hide and it's a fierce exercise in cinema as a purely
visual art form. The film laughs in the face of foolish things
like "plot" and "dialogue," instead bombarding us with display after
display of innovative, imaginative stylizations. It's not to be treated
as a story on celluloid but rather as a kaleidoscope of dynamic images.
Detective Woo (Joong-Hoon Park; the name is evidently a tribute to
famous Hong Kong/US director John Woo) has just received an especially
difficult assignment. He has to catch the perpetrator of the "Forty
Steps" murder, something having to do with drug trafficking. The killer
is a drug lord named Chang Sungmin (Sung-Kee Ahn), a master of escape
on par with Houdini, and will prove nearly impossible to catch.
So Woo and partner detective Kim (Dong-Kun Jang) spend countless
sleepless nights tracking down Sungmin. There are foot chases,
interrogations, fistfights, wrestling bouts and stakeouts. Woo and Kim
find Sungmin's lover and try to pry his whereabouts out of her but to
no avail. Woo, with a crushed hat, hunched figure and funny walk, does
a lot of complaining about his job but seems to revel in it all the
same. He has a love-hate relationship with his occupation: he seems
tired of it but doesn't seem able to do without it.
This is the plot. It's nothing major but it's of little consequence
anyway. Nowhere to Hide is not concerned with it. Director Myung Se-
Lee's main intention is to do as many things as possible with violence.
There are fights that suddenly turn into rhythmic waltzes, chase scenes
transforming into paintings and boxing matches taking place entirely in
shadows on a wall. Violence gets turned into slapstick, impressionism
and dance numbers -- though we're not always proud of what we're so
gleefully enjoying, the film is exhiliratingly surprising.
Lee likes his camera tricks. There's slow motion, stop-motion, high-
contrast black and white, morphs and a lot of other things. Unlike a
certain controversial american auteur whose name I won't mention (yes I
will -- Oliver Stone), these things don't get in the way of the story
(mainly because there's not much of a story to get in the way of) or
give you a headache. They're there to please and to amaze, not to
overwhelm. It's hard to argue that they serve a purpose other than to
be nifty, but what they do, they do well.
The pamphlet for the movie quotes Lee saying that the reason for
Nowhere to Hide was to explore movement as something that fuels action,
not vice-versa. I dunno. It's an unconventional action movie, but it's
still an action movie. Watching it, I didn't sense aspirations to be
more than that. It's funny, cool, exhilirating, eye-popping, fun. The
plot, characters and actors are there, I suspect, only because Lee
thought he couldn't draw audiences if he made just a collection of
images without at least a facade of a storyline. I don't get to say
this often, but no substance -- no problem.

Title
Review for Kiss of the Dragon (2001)
"I would appreciate it if you didn't do that again."
Starring Jet Li, Bridget Fonda, Tchéky Karyo, Burt
Kwouk. Directed by Chris Nahon. Rated R.
It's no secret that martial arts film often use their
plot simply to get from one action sequence to
another. When the fight scenes are enough to justify
paying admission, there is no problem with this, as in
most Jackie Chan projects and a lot of the Hong Kong
actioners. When they aren't, well, we're in bad shape.
Kiss of the Dragon, Jet Li's second consecutive
American misfire, plays like one big miscalculation,
and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment.
Now before I start getting e-mails angrily touting the
genius of Jet Li, let me explain myself. Li is as
spectacular as ever here, and I don't think anyone
would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into
question. The problem isn't with him, it's with the
movie's tone. The much touted fight-scenes here are
filmed with such unflinching, unrelenting brutality
that they are unpleasant to watch. They're joyless,
perfuctory; Li's rogue Chinese detective is more of a
killing machine than a hero, a Terminator with a black
belt instead of a metal skeleton. But even the
Terminator in Judgement Day had a sympathetic side.
The plot isn't relevant, but if you're curious, it's
some nonsense about a Chinese law enforcement officer
(Li) sent to Paris to investigate a possible drug ring
and encounter a corrupt Chief of Police (Tcheky
Karyo), who kills people and does sinister things with
no motivation whatsoever. Oh yeah, and Li's character
is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain
and/or kill at the touch of a needle. "Kiss of the
Dragon" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver, in
which you stick a needle in a precise location on the
back of the victim's neck, somehow redirecting all of
the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor
sap more or less immediately.
There's a vague attempt to humanize Li by having him
fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute, whose
daughter is being held hostage, for some reason, by
the villain. This is one of the worst love stories I
have ever seen on screen, even worse than the one in
Pearl Harbor. There's no conviction whatsoever as the
movie barely pays lip service to it; it's only here
because someone apparently thought there should be
some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot.
Kiss of the Dragon was written by Luc Besson, whose
screenplay The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,
for all of that film's flaws, was at least thoughtful.
I don't know why the guy got himself involved in this
train wreck, but perhaps he wanted to so something
more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of The
Fifth Element and the aforementioned stylized biopic.
I suppose you could call this mainstream, but I'll
choose the bizarre any time of the day.
If action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal
instead of dazzling, you need a story to justify
watching them. The filmmakers behind Kiss of the
Dragon should have rethought their strategy. No one
will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling, but
I hear Rush Hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks.

Review for Stigmata (1999)
 Starring Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce. Rated R.
The influence of the MTV generation on cinema has never been more
apparent than in Stigmata, a visually stunning, prepostrously plotted
thriller that also happens to be vehemently anti-Catholic. MGM will
never hear the end of it from the ubiquitous, uncomfortably large
Catholic League, and understandably so; unlike some of the films that
activist groups have made a fuss about, it's not hard to see where this
one may offend. Let the offended ones balk, but this is tremendously
enjoyable trash, an audaciously stylized full-length music video that
manages to deliver a smart, surprisingly restrained message in a story
that doesn't make an iota of sense.
Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette), a spunky Pittsburg hairdresser who is
also an atheist, comes home after a night on the town. She's tired. A
nice, warm bath seems like a tantalizingly good idea, so she decides to
take one. As she submerges herself in the water, something happens. Her
body thrashes in the tub, as if under the will of an invisible attacker.
Next thing she knows, she is in the hospital. There are identical
puncture wounds on both of her wrists. They go all the way through,
piercing both flesh and bone. The doctor reasonably assumes, considering
the nature of the injuries and the circumstances under which they were
incurred, that she mutilated herself in an apparent suicide attempts.
Frankie denies it, claiming that she loves her life and would not even
think about ending it.
A couple of days pass. Frankie and her pal (Nia Long) are on a subway
train. Something happens. The lights go out and the car shakes. Frankie
moves into the middle, her arms outstretched and holding on to the
overhead compartments. She receives numerous whippings on her back,
again coming from a seemingly invisible attacker. Is it a coincidence
that a group of nuns and priests were in the same car with her? What is
happening to this innocent woman?
These events are brought to the attention of the Roman Catholic Church,
which sends Father Andrew Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne, who, ironically, will
be playing Satan in the upcoming End of Days), a
priest/scientist/gumshoe to investigate. The suspicion, of course, is
that Frankie is a stigmatic, one of the very rare people afflicted with
the wounds of Christ. But stigmatics are invariably deeply faithful
people, and Frankie being an atheist presents a fundamental
contradiction. This is so unheard of, in fact, that Kiernan is ready to
dismiss the case, that is until Frankie, angry, confused and vulnerable,
convinces him to probe further. In doing so, he finds himself
questioning his own loyalties.
I can't go into too much detail without revealing some of the plot's
secrets, but to accept Stigmata's story is to accept the fact that God
would be willing to cause severe injury to people in order to get his
point across. Considering this film's devoutly religious message, that
is ludicrous. The thought mires down the movie at every turn, since we
are constantly depended on to accept it.
I never believed the film for a second, but I was delighted with the way
young director Rupert Wainwright (um, Blank Check, anyone?) brought it
to life. He will take flack for employing the "MTV style" of filmmaking
(some have unfairly labeled it "attention deficit disorder filmmaking),
but I defend his choice. The rapid, stylish, somewhat hyperactive way
Stigmata was filmed, along with its booming, spontaneous soundtrack, not
only makes the film more palatable but it also diverts our attention
somewhat from the movie's inconsistencies and makes it easier to watch.
Give Rupert Wainwright a good script, I say, and we may have our next
Brian DePalma.
Patricia Arquette gives an astonishingly good performance as the
physically and emotionally battered Frankie. At times, her grief is
devastatingly palpable. Gabriel Byrne reminded me a bit too much of
Jason Miller's Damien Karras in The Exorcist, but I suppose that was not
fully unintentional. Actually, Stigmata is less similar to the William
Peter Blatty classic than many have claimed. It isn't nearly as scary --
or as good -- but it is more thoughtful and less patently devilish.
Stigmata has a good cast, wonderful style and some effective filmmaking
all undermined by the implausibility of its story. It's an intelligent
movie and it is a well-made one; if only I could believe it.

Review for World Is Not Enough, The (1999)
 "Why can't you just say 'hello,' like a normal person?"
Starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Robert Carlyle, Denise
Richards, Judi Dench. Rated PG-13.
Why can't James Bond just say "hello" like a normal person instead of
the cocky "The name is Bond, James Bond" staple? I don't think people
get a kick out of it anymore. Instead of eliciting knowing nods, it
produces lame chuckles. It's worn out and it needs to go the way of
Timothy Dalton. As a matter of fact, it's not the only thing that needs
to be eliminated from Bond's repertoire. I move for all trademark
phrases to be erased. That means buh-bye, "Martini, shaken, not
stirred." No more "talking killer." Here's a franchise desperately in
need of a reworking, and I don't mean erasing all sentimental value and
making a conventional thriller. I mean completely original, more tongue-
in-cheek humorand less self-importance. After 19 installments, the old
tradition is wearing thin.
Bond's latest escapade, uncleverly titled The World is Not Enough, runs
through all the regular conventions -- catch phrases, bodacious babes,
bad puns, et al -- except they aren't as much fun. The maniacal
supervillain this time around is Renard (Robert Carlyle), an aspiring
oil tycoon with a bullet embedded in his cranium. The bullet makes him
immune to pain and while it will eventually kill him, he grows stronger
and stronger until the day he dies. His evil plan for world domination
involves taking over a pipeline owned by the sexy Elektra (Sophie
Marceau) whose father was just killed in a bombing at Bond's
headquarters.
007 is dispatched by head honcho M (the formidable Judi Dench, playing
my favorite character in the series) to help Elektra, but whether she
actually needs help is debatable. Is she really the good girl she seems
to be? Or does she have an ulterior motive in this risky endeavor. Any
guesses? Anyone?
Things get personal when Renard kidnaps M. Rescuing her becomes Bond's
highest priority and he enlists the help of a gorgeous nuclear
physicist named Christmas Jones (Denise Richards, and by the way, where
do you get off saying a women is not interested in men at all and then
have her wear shorts above the thigh and revealing tanktops? Oh, never
mind, this is a Bond movie. I get it now. Beg your pardon.) to diffuse
the bomb Renard has planted in the pipeline and get to the place where
he's stashed away Bond's beloved boss.
This is the same old stuff except the camp value has all but
disappeared, the action isn't as exciting and the puns get lamer every
second. Director Michael Apted (responsible for, along with about 40
other movies, Nell and Gorillas in the Mist; this is, however, his
first crack at a 007 feature), who's a film veteran if ever there was
one, doesn't inject the movie with enough life; the action, with the
exception of one scene involving a bomb and a quickly moving
contraption inside a pipeline, seems perfunctory and mundane. For all
the flaws of Tomorrow Never Dies, at least that installment, helmed by
Roger Spottiswoode, had its share of exhilirating chase sequences and
inventive gadgetry. The World is Not Enough doesn't even have any cool
new Bond gizmos to amuse us with.
Pierce Brosnan is no Sean Connery, but he is one of the better things
about this movie. Charming and charismatic, I'd have to say he is the
best Bond since Connery left the scene to pursue romantic film
relations with women about 1/3 his age. Sophie Marceau and Denise
Richards are both fairly atrocious though, and while a good Bond goes
along way, he can't pull the whole movie out of the water when it's
desperately drowning.
When Bond was resurrected in 1995 with Goldeneye, the world accepted it
because of what can only be called the novelty of the old. People went
six years without Bond and all the old Bond traditions brought back to
life seemed new and cool again. Now that's worn off and the MGM
franchise is in need of some new life. Keep Brosnan. Change everything
else.

Review for 13th Warrior, The (1999)
Starring Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora, Omar Sharif, Vladimir Kulich,
Dennis Storhři, Maria Bonnevie. Rated R.
Michael Crichton is quite a character; his films could use a little. The
Thirteenth Warrior, John McTiernan's long-delayed adaptation of
Crichton's Eaters of the Dead is gleefully entertaining in its tongue-
in-cheek delivery and its pseudo-rite-of-passage tale, but its bloody
battle scenes lack soul. A factor to elevate the movie above mediocrity
seems to always be missing. It's campy fun, but it fails to ever become
good filmmaking.
McTiernan casts Antonio Banderas as Ahmahd ibn Fahdalan, a Muslim (yeah,
right) who travels the world as an ambassador. He wonders into Norse
territory and meets a group of engimatic warriors. As he is wining and
dining with them, a message is brought: the Norse are being attacked by
horrendous monsters and the warriors must choose thirteen men to fight
them. The catch: the thirteenth man must be from another, preferably
faraway land. Three guesses on who the chosen one is. A hint: it's a
Muslim who looks oddly like Zorro.
The lucky baker's dozen sets off into the Viking lands to seek out and
destroy this mysterious nemesis. An unwitting Ahmahd soon winds up
discovering his warrior instincts. It turns out that even though he may
not be hot stuff with a sword, he can wreak havoc if you give him a
really big knife. Soon, he is fighting alongside his companions and
getting passionate about his mission, which he did not choose to accept.
Along with dedication comes the respect of his new peers. Before he
knows it, he is a warrior -- and a man.
The Thirteenth Warrior takes its story very seriously, but its delivery
has intermittent touches of wit. The film does its best to rid itself of
any sense of pretension. There it succeeds: it isn't a significant movie
in any way shape or form and it knows it, making its sole purpose to
have some fun with its premise. Is it fun? On occasion. The movie is at
its best when there is no fighting going on; it becomes curiously airy
then, and as such, entertaining.
The problems lie in the battle scenes. While the rest of the film is
inventive and sometimes even exhilirating, its action centerpieces come
off as almost perfunctory. There is nothing fresh in the fight scenes;
heads roll, blood flies through the air, but it all blends together.
There is little that's distinctive or that can grab our attention. It's
sensationally gory, but it lacks the audaciousness to make the gore
amount to much of anything.
It is obviously difficult to accept Antonio Banderas as Ahmahd.
Everytime he took out a sword or a knife, I expected him to carve a "Z"
into something. He is a good actor, but he has been horridly miscast. I
never had the feeling that I was watching anything other than Antonio
Banderas playing someone he wasn't meant to play. Dennis Storhři, on the
other hand, is interesting as the Viking warrior who befriends Ahmahd.
He's the sort of wisecracking sidekick-but-not-really we've come to
expect from these kinds of movies, but with a twist: he is the
protagonist's mentor rather than helper.
Here's a movie that works like a charm until it gets to the scenes that
are supposed to be its highlight. Almost everything here works, except
the most important element. As a result, The Thirteenth Warrior is just
plain ok.

Review for Three to Tango (1999)
Starring Matthew Perry, Neve Campbell, Dylan McDermott, Oliver Platt.
Rated PG-13.
The cast of the ultra-popular tv show Friends have had a curse placed
on them: it seems that none of them can star in a good movie. Picture
Perfect anyone? Ed? Kissing a Fool? Their success rate on the silver
screen has been abominable. But now, with Matthew Perry's Three to
Tango, if the Friends curse isn't broken, it's starting to tear at the
seams. This latest attempt is an entertaining, inoffensive, highly
likeable (though derivative) production, with all the makings of a box-
office and critical success.
After an entertaining titles sequence, we are introduced to Oscar Novak
(Perry) and Peter Steinberg (Oliver Platt), two architects who have
come to the office of Charles Newman, a rich tycoon who is building a
cultural center named after himself. The team of Oscar and Peter seems
homely in comparison to the competition: two limitlessly wealthy suits
who are willing to go to any lengths, monetary and otherwise, to get
this project. After they are told that they have to build a model of
their proposal, which would cost at least 150 thousand dollars, Oscar
and Peter doubt their chances against the moneybags they are pitted
against until a series of unexpected developments changes the rules
entirely.
Through a series of misunderstandings, Newman comes to believe that
Oscar is gay, when in reality it is Peter who "bats for the other
team". Newman is currently cheating on his wife with Amy, a beautiful,
oddly Seinfeld-ish New Yorker (Neve Campbell) and is afraid that a
hunky football player might try to make a pass at his mistress. Because
he thinks Oscar is gay, he orders him to keep tabs on Amy and report
back to him with information on whom she mingles with and how she
mingles with them.
Oscar, of course, is not gay and he starts to like Amy, who really does
seem like a fine gal, unlike many bitchy female figures in these kinds
of movies. She continues to think that he is gay and is kept in the
dark about his romantic affection for her. Of course, Oscar has to keep
pretending he is gay and not show his crush on Amy for fear of losing
the project for himself and his partner in the unfortunate circumstance
that Newman finds out that the man who he sent to spy on his girlfriend
is courting her.
The situation is complicated further when the newspapers decide to do a
story on him, profiling him as a prosperous gay businessman. Now
everyone in the world thinks he is gay, leading to indecent proposals
from strangers of the incorrent gender. The story also lessens his
chances of confessing his love for Amy without publically pronouncing
that he is not gay and risk losing his architectural gig.
Three to Tango elicits memories of a similarly delightful comedy, In
and Out with Kevin Kline. That film had the same basic premise but was
more gay-friendly and was not a romance. Comparisons to In and Out are
inevitable, but in fact, they are two completely different films. Which
is superior is hard to say, but this one is definitely a match for the
1997 critical darling. It's a light-hearted, funny movie that, if
nothing else, produces consistent chuckles and a few laugh-out-loud
moments. Though Three to Tango ultimately fails to emotionally involve
us with its characters, it is fast paced and never tedious; making up
for thematic inadequacies with sharp wit.
Neve Campbell's performance is rather generic, though her character is
a likeable one; fortunately, Perry and Platt more than make up for her
undistinctiveness. Perry still seems to be playing his Chandler
character from Friends, but since I happen to love Chandler, I was glad
to say hi to the old friend on the big screen. Oscar is a tad less
cynical and sarcastic than his veritable counterpart, but for some
reason I still thought "Chandler". That certainly doesn't mean that
Perry isn't funny in the role; quite the contrary, he is a hoot. Platt
fares even better. He's a naturally funny actor, with an uncanny flair
for delivering one-liners, and his talents make Three to Tango even
more enjoyable. His character doesn't go very far, but he sure is a
good source of guffaw-worthy lines like the one above.
The ending of the film is ordinary and unsatisfying, resorting to
painfully obvious cliches in order to squeeze out as happy a conclusion
as humanely possible (it's ironic, too, that the characters actually
make fun of movie cliches while conforming to them). It likewise didn't
hurt the movie a great deal because I was never induced to make a great
personal investment in the characters and thus wasn't too disappointed
when their story wrapped-up in a traditional romantic comedy fashion.
It didn't take away from the fact that the film was zingy and
entertaining; a feather-light delight.

Review for Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (2001)
Featuring the voice talents of Ming-Na, Ving Rhames,
Alec Baldwin, Steve Buscemi, Peri Gilpin, Donald
Sutherland, James Woods. Directed by Hironobu
Sakaguchi. Rated PG-13.
Are computer-animated actors bound to replace Julia
Roberts, Bruce Willis and the rest of their
flesh-and-blood kin? Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within
makes the first convincing case for the affirmative.
While none of the "actors" here can not yet be
mistaken for a human being, this is easily the most
impressive CGI on display in a completely animated
motion picture. The word "cartoon" will soon become
extinct.
The plot concerns the adventures of Dr. Aki Ross
(voice of Ming-Na, who, a couple of years back,
brought the title character in Disney's Mulan to
life), a scientist who believes in the Gaia theory.
The film's version of Gaia involves 8 spirits, each
contained in a different life form somewhere on earth.
Earth, unfortunately, is being invaded by aliens
called Phantoms, who landed on a crashed meteor. To
kill the Phantoms, Ross needs to collect all eight
spirits, and use them to create some sort of wave that
will cancel out the Phantoms' life force.
The villain is a vigilante general who doesn't believe
in all this Gaia mumbo-jumbo, and whose elaborate
strategy for defeating the aliens consists of blowing
them all to smithereens using some futuristic version
of a nuke. So Ross teams up with a group of army
officers sent to protect her to find the 7th and 8th
spirits before the evil general can use his death ray,
which will only make matters worse.
Final Fantasy is based on a video game, but the movie
is by no means unaccessable to someone who has never
picked up the controls of a Playstation. The story is
actually quite easy to follow; it's also not very
interesting, as often happens with movies that pay
more attention to technical wizardry than to plot. The
science fiction here is like something out of a
second-rate Japanese anime, completely run-of-the-mill
and unaware of its own absurdity.
But no matter. I had no problems spending the 100-some
minutes simply looking at the pictures, which are even
more astounding than the trailer made them look. The
film plays like a window into a parallel universe
rather than a work of animation. The characters aren't
quite human-looking, and yet they are, with their hair
bouncing and waving in the wind, and their flesh
looking like you can reach over and touch it.
What's the point? Why go to such pains to create an
artificial reality when you can simply film with real
actors? Animation allows artists to truly create their
own world, almost unaffected by the budget constraints
that would otherwise plague a filmmaker. This is why
you're hard-pressed to find a CGI animated version of
You Can Count on Me: it would be a pointless exercise
in showing off. Final Fantasy, as well as some of the
summer's other animated flicks, use their
breakthroughs in graphics to achieve the fantastic.
When this spectacular technology finds a visionary --
John Lasseter, perhaps? -- with a story to tell as
well as pictures to show, we will be in for something
truly incredible. This has not happened yet. Final
Fantasy works better as a 2-hour demo reel than as
movie, a showcase of what we can do and what we can do
better. 

Title
Review for General's Daughter, The (1999)
"Elizabeth once told me she was conducting a field investigation in
psychological warfare, and the enemy was Daddy."
Starring John Travolta, Madeline Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton,
Clarence Williams, James Woods, Leslie Stefanson. Rated R.
I despise filmmakers that use plot exclusively as a means of getting
their movie exactly where they want it to go. Plot is a film's most
important element and it should be respected; attempts to manipulate it
for the sake of convenience will more than likely come back to haunt the
movie. The General's Daughter, a self-serving and sloppy new murder
mystery for John Travolta, is guilty as charged.
At the center of The General's Daughter is a mysterious rape and murder.
The victim is Captain Elizabeth Campbell, the daughter of a newly
retired military general (James Cromwell), which gives the case a high
profile and a desire by many to keep it under tight wraps. Thus, Officer
Paul Brenner (John Travolta), from the military's criminal investigation
division and his new rape-expert partner Sara Sunhill (Madeline Stowe)
are given 36 hours to investigate before the FBI comes in and any hopes
of keeping things quiet are destroyed.
Sooner than later, Brenner finds out about Elizabeth's spooky "extra-
curricular activities" such as an S&M fetish, complete with equipment
and violent porno tapes in a secret room in the basement. Some evidence
from the crime itself convinces his partner that this was no ordinary
rape. They then embark on a mission to "Go behind the lies", as the
movie's promotion immodestly trumpets and uncover the truth behind the
murder of Captain Elizabeth Campbell.
The General's Daughter, bless its soul, keeps the relationship between
Brenner and Sunhill completely platonic thereby avoiding the cliches
that plague movies that feature romances between two law enforcement
officials working together. Actually, I'm not even sure that the
filmmakers could have inserted a romance into this film if they tried --
its 115 minutes are already full to the brim. Alas that may be part of
the problem: there is sure a lot going on, but the story seems to have
been hastily put together and is not thought out thoroughly enough to
make so many plot elements blend together successfully. This is
especially evident in the ending, when the film apparently tries to give
us two separate explanations for what actually happened but never
bothers to sort it all out. I'm still not sure whether the first
solution we are given is merely an indirect approach to the second or
whether we are supposed to believe that Brenner never fully succeeded in
"going behind the lies".
Writer Christopher Bertolini and director Simon West (the man
responsible for Con Air, the only movie I know with a 50 minute climax)
are so concerned about the numerous details of the crime that they
completely forget about the characters at its core. Brenner and Sunhill
are little more than plot devices inserted to take us through the story.
We are never presented with any reason to care about these people or
what they do. Brenner is supposed to be a passionate man with a fierce
determination for uncovering the truth but the movie never tries to make
the character dynamic. How are we expected to give a damn about the
story if we can't get involved with its protagonists?
But what angered me the most about The General's Daughter is how it
winds up conveniently dispensing with anyone directly involved with the
crime so it can focus solely on its final theme. The movie knows what it
wants to say and is determined to say it even at the cost of sacrificing
plausibility and plot resolution. It's like a bulldozer making its way
to its final destination, blindly destroying everything in its path.
There is little in The General's Daughter to satisfy a viewer seeking
thrills and absolutely nothing to appeal to anyone seeking a
cinematically sound work. It's a movie that needs to go back to the
drawing board.

Review for Scary Movie 2 (2001)
Starring Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans,
Regina Hall, James DeBello, Natasha Lyonne, Andy
Richter, James Woods, Chris Elliot. Directed by Keenan
Ivory Wayans. Rated R.
When I reviewed Scary Movie last year, I said that the
only litmus test for a movie like this is whether it's
consistently funny, making it exceedingly difficult to
review. While that film worked more times than not,
its obligatory sequel is far less consistent. Yes,
there are laughs in Scary Movie 2, but they're
sporadic, with a lot of the jokes being regurgitated
from the original.
The movie brings back those characters that weren't
offed in its predecessor. Anna Faris returns as Neve
Campbell... um, I mean, Cindy Campbell, who has now
gone on to college along with her friends Ray Maker
and Shorty Meeks (Shawn and Marlon Wayans). While the
first movie spoofed Scream and its slasher flick
rip-offs, this one bewilderingly sets its sights on
The Haunting, of all movies: a relative box-office
flop and a bad reviews magnet (though I liked it). Why
this alleged pop-culture parody focuses on a movie
that disappeared after a couple of weeks in theaters,
we may never know.
But the central "plot" doesn't begin until after the
opening sequence, a priceless take on The Exorcist. A
group of friends, including a priest, is gathered
around the piano singing old showtunes when, suddenly,
they break out into Mystikal's rap song "Shake Your
Ass." Shame when a comedy's first gag is its funniest.
But there's still some fun to be had when James Woods
shows up as Father McFeely, parodying Max von Sydow's
unforgettable Father Merrin.
It's mostly downhill from there. Director Keenan Ivory
Wayans is stuck spoofing what doesn't particularly
need to be spoofed, and winds up repeating his jokes.
Chris Elliot shows up as the creepy caretaker with a
mutilated hand and Tim Curry has the dubious privilege
of making fun of the Liam Neeson role in The Haunting.
Most of the jokes after the first 10 minutes miss
their mark, and those that hit are non sequiturs that
are funny by accident.
Dimension Films, hungry for a quick and easy cash cow,
refused to postpone the release date for Scary Movie
2, forcing Wayans to rush through production. Perhaps
that is the reason for the film's sloppy,
unprofessional feel. Then again, it's also credited to
seven -- count 'em -- screenwriters, and one of the
rules of moviemaking is that the number of scribes is
inversely proportional to a script's quality.
I'm at a loss for what else to write. See Scary Movie
2 if you have nothing else to do. It's not a complete
waste of time, but it doesn't quite work as the
laugh-out-loud culture parody it wants to be.

Review for Road to El Dorado, The (2000)
 Featuring the voice talents of Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Armand
Assante, Rosie Perez, Edward James Olmos, Frank Welker. Directed by
Bibo Bergeron and Will Finn. Rated PG.
I'll get straight to the question that was on many people's minds
regarding The Road to El Dorado: is Dreamworks' attempt at traditional
animation on par with the movies the Mouse House is releasing annually?
Well, for what it's worth, I liked it a little bit better than Tarzan.
It's certainly nowhere near as satisfying as some of Disney's previous
efforts. Still, this amiable little cartoon is an enjoyable diversion
even if it isn't (and it isn't) the animated masterpiece that
Dreamworks' CGI Antz was.
Essentially a cartoon version of Ridyard Kipling's "The Man Who Would
Be King," which was itself made into a movie starring Sean Connery in
1975, The Road to Eldorado tracks the adventures of Miguel (Kenneth
Branagh) and Tulio (Kevin Kline), two resourceful crooks looking for
adventure. They spend their days scamming passers-by out of their money
by playing craps with loaded dice and each feigning innocence when
discovered. In one of these craps games, they win a treasure map. With
nothing to lose and apparently a lot to gain, they stowaway on a boat
heading in the general direction of the destination indicated on the
map. Unfortunately, the ship happens to belong to one of Spain's most
militant explorers who finds the two crooks and throws them in the
dungeon.
With the help of one very groovy horse, Miguel and Tulio escape and
wind up in the New World -- exactly where they were heading in the
first place. Following the map, they discover El Dorado, a.k.a. the
City of Gold, whose residents along with the benevolent chief (Edward
James Olmos) and the malevolent High Priest (Armand Assante) are
convinced that Miguel and Tulio are gods. The con men play that for all
it's worth, of course, hoping to sail away in a brand new boat and with
a hefty load of gold to boot. But they can't do it without the
involvement of a scheming young woman (Rosie Perez) who discovers
Miguel and Tulio's plan and blackmails them to let her in on it.
The Road to El Dorado is thoroughly watchable and thoroughly harmless.
Much like Tarzan, the songs here are mostly kept in the background
(with one noticeable exception), keeping the film from being a full-
fledged musical. This is probably a wise choice: perhaps the biggest
criticism of the last few Disney 'toons was of the showtunes that
relentlessly permeated the action. When done well, they can get stuck
in your head (like every song in The Lion King) but when the
songwriters whiff it, they are at best forgettable and at worst
irritating. El Dorado sort of skirts the issue by making the songs
background music.
Kevin Kline is a wonderful voice talent with unbeatable deadpan
delivery. As Tulio, he more than makes up for the fact that Branagh as
Miguel is more than a little dull. Branagh simply fails to do anything
distinctive with his character. Kids need specific little quirks or
catchphrases to remember characters by and the movie, along with the
actor, fails to provide them for one of its protagonists.
Other than that, the film is well-intentioned and it mostly succeeds.
The adventures are fun, Rosie Perez is funny, the villain is
sufficiently menacing to make the young 'uns hate him and cheesy enough
to make adults chuckle. My one question: why did Dreamworks insert
skinny-dipping scenes and profanity to make the film PG instead of G?
It doesn't make any sense and if anything, it probably hurt the movie's
box-office.
The Road to El Dorado is hardly the Road Less Traveled, but it's decent
while it lasts. Not everything has to be for the ages.

Review for Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The (1999)
The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Starring Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Faye Dunaway, Dustin Hoffman.
Rated R.
The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc is an intelligent film with
intelligent ideas. It has a more-than-workable script and a first-rate
cast. Its problems lie in its tone and execution. Director Luc Besson
(the n is silent), whose last film was the visually stunning The Fifth
Element doesn't quite realize this project's potential. His rampant use
of humor is often inappropriate and while it may generate a laugh, it
also serves to spoil the mood. There are limits to everything.
The two-and-a-half hour film stumbles out of the starting line, opening
with a map of Europe accompanied by a historical summary in the form of
titles which race across the screen at a jaw-droppingly fast pace,
leaving most of the audience in the dust (but worry not: if you want to
know some of the history behind the movie, simply read the next
paragraph; contrarily if you do not want to know what happens, skip the
next three). The film goes on to tell the still controversial story of
Joan of Arc, the teenager who led France to victory over England in the
13th century, claiming to be a messenger from God.
Around the turn of the (13th) century, France and England signed a
treaty providing that upon the death of France's ruler, France shall
become part of England's kingdom. The kings of both countries die
within months of each other, leaving France in the hands of the new
king of England, who is only a few months old at the time. France's
Dauphin (played here by John Malkovich) has no intention of giving up
his country to an infant and puts up a hell of a defense against the
formidable British military.
Enter Joan of Arc. This spunky 19 year-old believes that she is
receiving messages directly from the Big Kahuna himself. She thinks God
is telling her to lead the French army to victory against the British
to save the French Empire and make a king out of the Dauphin. The
Dauphin, eager to please the masses and ready to jump at any chance to
put a crown on his head, gives her the army. Joan takes control and
gets some stunning victories, one of which she obtains merely by
telling the British to "go home."
France is free and the Dauphin is king, but the story is far from over.
Her tales of messages from God rise suspicions of witchcraft on her
part, turning her saga into the best-known witchcraft trial ever sans
Salem. The last act of the film covers this in detail, and it is by far
the best The Messenger has to offer; the most powerful and compelling
part of the movie is its last.
Imagine, if you will, an intense battle scene. The sets are elaborate,
the action is frenetic, the music is blaring, the audience is really
into it. Everyone is excited. All of a sudden, a guy's head gets
chopped off and we see the headless body still standing upright, with
blood copiously spurting out of where the head was supposed to be. This
elicits groans and laughs from the audience. The mood is ruined, the
excitement is diffused. This is The Messenger's main ailment. Besson
ruins important scenes by playing them to comic effect. I have no
problem with dark humor in an epic film like this one but it has to be
done right and in places where it fits. What this film does is like
mixing oil and water; instead of blending seamlessly, the humor and the
action interfere with each other, making for an uneven confection.
The 24-year-old Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element) plays the title
character with gusto but little grace which, I suppose, was the
intention. Jovovich is a relatively unknown actress and casting her was
a good idea; Joan is a controversial character and should not be
interfered with by an actress with an established personality. The
supporting cast is dynamite. John Malkovich provides some of the
appropriate comic relief in the movie as does Dustin Hoffman whose
character is significant and whose role I will not reveal for the sake
of preserving some of the film's non-historical surprises.
The Messenger is decidedly not a blockbuster. It has the gall not to
portray Joan as a hero, suggesting, more than anything else, that she
was indeed insane. This came as a pleasant surprise: here is a big-
budget movie that takes a big risk, straying from the crowd-pleasing
notion of heroism and woman-saves-the-world feminism. It works by
defying that expectation, by proposing a stand on an issue rather than
merely telling a version of the story.
In the midst of all this, Besson does not forget to thoroughly
modernize the tale, inserting generous amounts of '90s imagery and
employing a version of the ever-popular MTV filmmaking style, though
not settling into it as much as the stylistically similar Stigmata did
earlier this year. I can't well imagine The Messenger working without
all that imagery; it fits the story like a glove. As far as I'm
concerned, MTV itself is the spawn of Satan, but it sure does do
wonders for some films.
Most of what works in The Messenger is contained in its last 3rd and
what comes before it struck me as hastily put together. It's as if the
script wants to perfunctorily rush through the formalities and get to
the points it wants to make as painlessly as humanly possible. The
result is an extremely uneven first hour and a half. But the film's
terrific finale is enough, I think, to warrant a trip to the multiplex.

Title
Review for Inspector Gadget (1999)
Starring Matthew Broderick, Rupert Everett, Joely Fisher, Michelle
Trachtenberg, Andy Dick, Cheri Oteri. Rated PG.
The "Disney Stick-to-What-You-Do-Best" rule states that Disney's
animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their
hand at live-action kids' entertainment, they will fail miserably. This
goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation
of a popular cartoon (Remember the 1996 version of 101 Dalmations? I'm
still trying to forget).
That rule proves more dependable than ever with Inspector Gadget, an
insulting, despicable and, worst of all, expensive piece of trash trying
to pass itself off as a viable children's film. It will bore anyone over
five and should prove unbearable for adults, even at its relatively
skinny running time of 80 minutes. It's films like this that make me
want to go to my local Blockbuster and rent something from the days when
brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of
fancy effects.
Just as Matthew Broderick began to convince me that there is hope for
him as an actor yet, his career takes a nosedive to hell with his "role"
as John Brown, a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes
that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around
him. He dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long
time crush, Dr. Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher). But after a few bizarre
coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer.
John breaks every bone in his body while trying to save Dr. Brenda's
father. Dr. Brenda has been working on a "Gadget Project," which would
make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime. Feeling
indebted to John she decides to save his life by making him the subject,
realizing his dream of becoming a policeman. Now, when he says "Go Go
Gadget [insert name of gizmo here]" he can use all kinds of nifty
gadgets to capture crooks, bang up bandits and mangle murderers.
In the meantime, the evil Claw (Rupert Everett), the man responsible for
the murder of the good doctor's father is building a gadget of his own:
a carbon copy of our Inspector Gadget except evil and John Brown's worst
nemesis. Claw has plans of world domination, which leaves it up to the
Inspector and his Gadget Mobile (voice of D.L. Hughley) to save humanity
from his wrath.
State of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $90 million dollar
movie and yet director David Kelogg never sets up a convincing
atmosphere. Had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills
they would have wound up with the same effect. What we see on the screen
is like the raw ingredients of a meal: all of the expensive f/x amounts
to nothing.
Part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has
gone down the toilet in the condescending movie. Can kids really admire
a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams "Hey! You ran a stop sign!"
while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle? I think
that today's children will respond better to somebody dashing, someone
ultra-cool. They (probably) receive enough preaching from their parents
and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go
to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt.
In addition to the more complex complaints above, there's also the
simple stuff: Inspector Gadget is boring, formulaic and achingly
implausible. There's no feeling that the director really cares about his
story: more than any other film I've seen this year, this one really
feels like it was made on an assembly line. There's a popular commercial
(for Sprite, but that's irrelevant) running in movie theaters before
features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects. It
consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious (thank God) movie
called "Death Slug". Each executive gleefully presents a different
merchandise tie-in (Slug Taco! Slug on a stick!). At the end one of them
asks "What about the movie?" Another answers: "Well, we don't have a
script yet, but we can bang one out by Friday." They probably could have
replaced "Death Slug" with Inspector Gadget. This film contains the sort
of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula
that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the
script.
It's no coincidence that most good children's entertainment these days
comes from animation. Animated features take so long to maker that it
becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride
into their work. These kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good
percentage turn out worthless, sloppy and impersonal. The studios are
becoming factories and films their assembled products.

Title
Review for Summer of Sam (1999)
"The 44 Caliber Killer has struck again."
Starring John Leguizamo, Mira Sorvino, Adrian Brody, Jennifer Esposito,
Michael Rispoli, Bebe Neuwirth. Rated R.
Summer of Sam will be remembered as a waste of Spike Lee's abilities.
Lee is a great filmmaker, often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par
with Brian DePalma and Martin Scorsese and a storytelling ability
comparable to Steven Spielberg. But here, he gets himself into a bind.
His latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to
say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his
work.
The summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in New York City. It was the
hottest summer on record. To boot, New York's first serial killer was on
the loose: calling himself the Son of Sam, David Berkowitz killed 9
people in the New York area and frightened the whole city population. So
it was understandable that when NYC was hit with a citywide blackout,
people went berserk, causing billions of dollars in damage to the city.
The movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful
summer: Vinny (John Leguizamo), a club-hopping, adultrous hairdresser,
his benevolent wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino, looking young), Ritchie
(Adrian Brody), a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a Son of Sam
suspect, a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters.
We follow them through their roller coaster lives, thrown out of whack
even more by the recent killings. Vinny and Dionna have marital problems
because Vinny cheats and Dionna tries to please him, make him stay
faithful to her. Ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he
has started to become more and more "eccentric," and has degenerated to
the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his
girlfriend.
Tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of Son of
Sam's first murder looms; the night he promises he will strike again. A
local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of
the people that its members think might be suspects. At the top of the
list is Ritchie. Vinny, an unwilling part of the said group, is called
upon to set a trap for his friend.
As we watch these proceedings, some of which are painfully graphic, the
dreaded "So what?" question springs to mind. From the way this movie is
made, I'd have guessed that Spike Lee was trying to tell us something,
but as I searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there
to find. Lee touches on so much -- the media, the 70's punk scene, the
details of the actual killings, as well as the characters' very personal
dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a
coherent theme or make a discernible statement.
All is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow; it can be a saving
grace for the film to be enjoyable. Too bad Summer of Sam doesn't get
any help here. Frankly, it's a bore, a redundant and repetitive two hour
and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half
hour. There is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about
the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled
and its focus too vague.
Leguizamo's turn as Vinnie is annoying and whiny. The script makes it
clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed, but
still a good guy. You'd never guess from his performance. Adrian Brody
and especially Mira Sorvino fare better. Sorvino gives a riveting,
touching performance in a banal movie (I'm tempted to think that I liked
her because nearly everything else around her was inane); her character
is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart. Brody, too paints an
effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a
little more than he bargained for.
Summer of Sam has some superficial elements of a good film: it looks
great, it has a few notable performances and I suppose it's pretty well
directed, in a purely technical way. But it's also empty, pretentious
and boring. Like last year's The Thin Red Line, it's a movie by a
director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says
it anyway.

Title
Review for Anna and the King (1999)
Starring Jodie Foster, Chow Yun-Fat. Directed by Andy Tennant. Rated PG-
13.
Anna and the King is at least the fourth film adaptation of Margaret
Landon's fact based novel The King and I, and it's big, expensive and
soulless. Though good-looking, its lavish sets, fancy costumes and
luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional
wasteland that is Peter Krikes and Steve Meerson's script. So much
money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make
the movie interesting.
This is Jodie Foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant
Contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice
to show off her acting chops. She's trapped in the stoic role of Anna
Leonowens, the uptight, widowed British schoolteacher who comes to Siam
(now Thailand) with her son to instruct the king's (Chow Yun-Fat) son
in the ways of the West (because "the ways of England are the ways of
the world). The king likes her so much he puts her in charge of
educating the whole royal family (58 kids with 10 more in the way;
impressive, no?). The eldest prince is none too happy about this
("Father, have I offended you in some way? Why do you punish me with
imperialist schoolteacher?), but soon gets to know Anna and her stern-
mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her.
Meanwhile, Siam comes under attack from the neighboring British colony
of Burma. The king and his close advisors suspect that this is
Britain's doing which arouses suspicion in Siam, putting Anna in an
uncomfortable position. She is not sure what to make of this and seems
to herself suspect British involvement in the crisis but works to
diffuse the king's prejudices. He, though self-righteous as ever, can't
help but be influenced by the eloquent Anna and they slowly, quietly,
develop affections for each other.
There is a scene in the middle of Anna and the King where one of the
king's younger daughters dies. It's your classic deathbed scene, with
the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father, who tries only semi-
successfully to maintain his composure. Anna then comes in and cries a
bit. The sequence was there for a purpose: to evoke a strong emotional
response from the viewer. I'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet
this time, I was just sitting there, my emotions untouched. This
remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren.
We never develop connections to the characters; never given a reason to
care.
This ludicrously long epic was directed by Andy Tennant, whose last
film was Ever After, one of my favorites of 1998. I do not doubt
Tennant's ability to put together a decent movie, but Anna and the
King, aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically
deficient. The sets and scenery are gorgeous, but the camerawork does
nothing to convey its grandeur. Even Terrence Malick managed to do more
with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal The Thin Red Line than
Tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in
Malaysia. We feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point
of view; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us
with larger-than-life awe.
I liked both Foster and Yun-Fat, who give entertaining if not terribly
involving performances in the two lead roles. Foster's generally stoic
persona serves her well here, as she is playing a reserved, formal and
rather underdeveloped character. Yun-Fat is especially effective,
perfectly conveying the King of Siam's sangfroid permeated with violent
outbursts.
What does Anna and the King in is its inability to involve the viewer
in its characters and situations. The cast is great, the director is
talented, and the budget is lavish, but this ill-advised remake of the
classic Rogers and Hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those
things to form a compelling whole. This is an emotionless costume epic.

Title
Review for Play It to the Bone (1999)
 Starring Antonio Banderas, Woody Harrelson, Lolita Davidovich, Tom
Sizemore, Lucy Liu. Directed by Ron Shelton. Rated R.
With all the fuss that was made about Fight Club, it was a hell of a
letdown when the movie turned out to suck. Well, for all of us that
were sorely disappointed by the misbegotten David Fincher satire, along
comes Ron Shelton's Play It to the Bone, a film that deals with the
same themes in a similar fashion but is actually good. Funny, exciting,
sometimes profound and kind of sweet, it upstages the pretentious, mean-
spirited Fight Club in every way possible.
This movie has had the fiercest advertising campaign for a non-event
movie in recent memory, so regular moviegoers should have had the plot
drilled into their heads already. If not, it's very simple: Cesar
Dominguez and Vince Boudreau, two failed, over-the-hill middleweight
boxers, receive a phone call while they're training in the gym one
afternoon. It seems that the undercard fight for Mike Tyson can't take
place -- one of the boxers is dead and the other is stoned out of his
mind. Big-time Las Vegas program coordinators headed by Tom Sizemore
need two boxers desperately. They're willing to give Dominguez and
Boudreau $50,000 a piece and a guaranteed shot at a title if they come
to Las Vegas and fight each other that night.
They enlist the companionship and support (as well as the vehicle) of
Grase Pasic (Lolita Davidovich), an indecisive woman who, at some
point, had a relationship with both boxers; 6 years with Vince and 6
months with Cesar. Together they drive to Vegas (taking a detour, of
course, to look at rock striations). During the drive, Cesar tells
about his experimentation with homosexuality, as well as his crushing
loss in Madison Square Garden years prior. Soon, Cesar and Vince start
bickering, obviously trying to make it easier to hit each other later.
Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Lucy Liu), who proceeds to
seduce Vince and piss off Grace. Tom Sizemore shouts and curses for
almost all of his screen time. Grace Pasic seems like a great woman and
Cesar and Vince are people we don't mind spending time with. By the
time the all-important match approaches, we feel like the outcome
matters because the characters have really grown on us during the past
two hours.
Some writers have attacked this movie for the neutrality of its
climactic bout, offering the fact that we can't really root for either
contestant as a quibble. That is probably the most absurd criticism of
a movie that I've ever heard, this side of the idiots who chastised
Eyes Wide Shut for being unerotic. The fight is exciting precisely
because we don't know whom to root for. Rooting isn't the point and
that's exactly the intention. Shelton aims beyond the basic
entertainment value of a "big game" moment.
Antonio Banderas has finally found a role where his accent suits him
well and Harrelson was born to play Vince. But the real discovery here
is Lolita Davidovich. The 38-year-old Canadian-born actress recently
had smaller parts in Gods and Monsters and Mystery, Alaska, but her
breakthrough comes here. She brings a vital intelligence and sweetness
to the role, forming a likable character whom we have no trouble
accepting as an emotional catalyst for Cesar and Vince. When she's on
screen, the movie can do no wrong.
Ron Shelton has a passion and an eye for sports movies, previously
directing the Kevin Costner baseball vehicle Bull Durham as well as the
Harrelson/Wesley Snipes basketball movie White Men Can Jump. He directs
Play It to the Bone with a sure hand, never afraid to take his time but
also not forgetting to make things interesting. The climax is a
screaming menagerie of camera tricks so skillfully put together you
can't take your eyes off the screen.
It's not uncommon for relatively modest flicks like this one to be
lambasted from nearly every direction while pretentious crap like The
Hurricane is met with nearly unanimous critical hosannas. I'll hold my
ground as a staunch defender of the innocent

Title
Review for Ideal Husband, An (1999)
"To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance."
Starring Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Northam, Cate Blanchett,
Minnie Driver Rated PG-13.
Although Rupert Everett has been acting since the early 80's, he crawled
out of the woodwork just in 1997 with his shoulda-been-Oscar-nominated
turn as Julia Roberts' gay editor in My Best Friend's Wedding. Now, he's
finally gotten his long-deserved leading role in An Ideal Husband,
director Oliver Parker's light n' fluffy adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
play. It's a delightfully good romantic comedy about love, intrigue,
blackmail and of course marriage.
Jeremy Northam, last seen in David Mamet's brilliant The Winslow Boy
(also a period piece) stars as Lord Robert Chiltern, a respected and
wealthy politician whose public life is threatened when he is
blackmailed by an old acquaintance. Chiltern has been preparing a report
to the parliament regarding a certain canal project, and it was his
every intention to condemn it. However, Mrs. Laura Chevely has quite a
tidy sum invested in the project and she threatens to reveal the corrupt
way Chiltern attained his wealth (and has a document to prove it) unless
he speaks favorably of the project.
Lord Arthur Gorring (Everett, the star of the show) is a thirty-six year
old bachelor (unthinkable in the late 19th century) who speaks in
aphorisms and is fond of gems such as "I love to talk about nothing.
It's the only thing I know anything about." He is also Chiltern's good
friend and after Chiltern confides in him, he wants to help. When
Chiltern tells his wife (Cate Blanchett) the truth about his riches she
demands that he leave immediately. Everett then sets up a way for the
husband and wife to get back together: he plans to have both of them in
his house in rooms directly next to each other with neither of them
knowing where the other is. He then plans to talk to Chiltern and have
him say that he regrets what he has done and is deeply apologetic for it
so that his wife can hear it from the next room. The plan backfires when
Gorring's butler mixes up Chevely and Chiltern's wife, sending the
latter away while putting Chevely in the next room, forcing Chiltern to
think that Gorring and Chevely are having an affair.
An Ideal Husband is an entertaining, light-as-a-feather production, as
funny as it is affecting. There is a wicked, knowing charm emanating
from the star-studded cast. Sometimes Parker's movie seems like a
showcase for these actors and actresses, but I didn't mind. If stars can
act well in a film with the intention of exhibiting their talents, then
more power to them.
Indeed, this peculiar comedy owes much to its gloriously gifted roster
of performers. Rupert Everett again deserves Oscar attention; he is
absolutely delightful as London's most eligible bachelor, sly and suave
yet sympathetic at the same time. Jeremy Northam is just as good: even
though he doesn't get too many comedic scenes, his performance is quite
impressive. The roles given to Minnie Driver and Cate Blanchett aren't
particularly showy, but both of them being fantastic actresses, they
make the best of it. But the real gem is Julianne Moore as the sneaky
blackmailer. Enigmatic and often hilarious, an Oscar nomination is in
order for her turn here.
The thematic significance of An Ideal Husband is not constantly apparent
nor is it important to enjoy this picture. I liked it because of its
charm, because of its comedy and because of its performances and
wouldn't dream of complaining about lack of particularly deep substance.
The film has more than enough wit to make up for any such deficiency.
This isn't as good as films come, but it's a welcome antidote to a
summer of mediocre big-budget timewasters. This won't be a doorbuster,
but that's too bad because it has more laughs than Big Daddy and Wild
Wild West combined. Typical Hollywood irony at hand.

Title
Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
"I see dead people. Walking around like regular people."
Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia
Williams. Rated PG-13.
*Please note: I have found it exceedingly difficult to discuss this
movie without going into plot details. While I have tried to be as vague
as possible, if you plan to see this movie and want to stay completely
clueless about its twists and turns, hold off reading what follows until
you are a Sixth Sense virgin no more.
The ghost story is alive and well in Hollywood, it seems, with at least
three high-profile films that fit the bill being released this year. In
the infamous month of August, a notorious dumping ground for studios who
want wash their hands of films with little potential, Spyglass
Entertainment brings us The Sixth Sense, a somber, deceptively tricky
supernatural thriller that, unlike guilty pleasure films like The Mummy,
is a keeper for all the right reasons.
Bruce Willis is given his first role in a looooong time that requires
him to actually -- gasp! -- act. He plays Malcolm Crowe, a child
psychologist who becomes insecure after his failure with a patient and a
subsequent incident with him. His latest patient is a child named Cole
Sear (Haley Joel Osment), a deeply troubled kid who is convinced he is a
freak because of his peers' ceaseless tauntings. But there is more to
him than meets the eye. Cole claims that he sees dead people who walk
around like regular people. Their invariably gory fatal wounds are still
intact. They want the boy to perform tasks that they themselves cannot.
Malcolm, the M.D. that he is, at first does not believe Cole and The
Sixth Sense risks turning into another "Nobody believes me" story.
Fortunately it makes a hairpin turn off that perilous path as the good
doctor finds proof (dubious as it may be) of the phenomenon. Cole pleads
with Malcolm to "please make them go away." How he is to accomplish that
is a far more difficult matter.
The Sixth Sense is a triumph of calm, confident storytelling rather than
the feverishly kinetic plotting and filming we've come to expect from
Bruce Willis films. This movie is not slow, it's steady and constant.
It's a hypnotically engaging horror mystery; scary, intriguing and
mesmerizing. Here's a movie that is far more frightening yet far less
lauded than The Blair Witch Project, a film that simply isn't nearly as
horrifying as so many claim. The Sixth Sense on the other hand has more
merit as a horror movie than many have given it.
I've despised Bruce Willis for his choice of projects (as opposed to
lack of talent) but here he proves that he can handle a serious role.
His is a nice, quiet, skilled performance, with barely a hint of his
infamous trademark smirk. But, at the risk of repeating other critics,
the real star of The Sixth Sense is little Haley Joel Osment, a
frighteningly talented young actor who is more then up to his
unconventionally challenging role. He not only holds his own in talky,
complex sequences with Willis, but he outshines his older, more
experienced co-star every chance he gets. The movie itself isn't an
award contender but Osment's performance should not -- and I expect that
it will not -- be forgotten come Oscar time.
My biggest problem with The Sixth Sense is the film's ending. It is a
lot of things: shocking, creative, "cool" and a terrific way for
director/screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan to show off his plotting
prowess. What it's not, sadly, is a satisfactory denoument to all that
preceded it. It represents a gear shift rather than a resolution. A more
traditional conclusion may not have been as blindsiding or as showy but
it would have worked better with respect to the storyline. Still, the
ending that we are given will inspire many to go for a second viewing,
or at least to rewind scenes in their had to search for the suddenly
obvious clues to what was destined to happen.
The Sixth Sense is a psychological thriller for the patient, discerning
viewer. It makes no attempt to appeal to those with short attention
spans nor does it aim for the lowest common denominator. It's an
intelligent, complex film (although mostly in retrospect) that flaunts
strong performances, impressive direction and a denoument that will make
your jaw drop, even if it does not resolve as much of the conflict as it
should have. Here is a summer movie that isn't a "summer movie" at all.

Review for Bringing Out the Dead (1999)
Starring Nicolas Cage, John Goodman, Patricia Arquette, Ving Rhames,
Tom Sizemore. Rated R.
Martin Scorcese's latest project is his least potent since his first
(Boxcar Bertha, for the uninitiated, was easily his most turgid
endeavor). The ideas are here and so is the cast, but the set-ups in
the script are merely serviceable. Bringing Out the Dead has a lot of
things going for it but is unable to finally bring them all together
into a compelling whole. It's still a decent feature from one of our
most respected auteurs, but one of Scorcese's masterpieces this ain't.
In his most demanding role since Leaving Las Vegas, Nicolas Cage plays
Frank Pierce, who sleeps by day and is an EMS technician by night. His
stressful job has been getting to him lately, to the point where he
begs his boss to fire him. He thinks he is seeing ghosts of people he
couldn't save as he is driving around nighttime New York City. His
partner (John Goodman) thinks he is losing it, and he may not be all
wrong.
Pierce befriends the daughter of a dying man (Patricia Arquette). Her
guilt and despair drive her to enter the drug underworld from which
Frank must save her without descending there himself. It's harder than
it sounds, especially when a mysterious drug-lord persuades him to take
a pill that gives him the best few hours of sleep in his life. This
dilemma only adds to the stress in his life, and we begin to see that
he is on a verge of a breakdown.
The straw that finally breaks the camel's back is Frank's new partner,
Marcus (Ving Rhames). Though his intentions are honorable, Marcus is a
loud-mouthed, irritating guy who gets on Frank's nerves with his
endless Bible-quoting diatribes. Just when he thought his life couldn't
get any more depressing, he gets partnered with this guy. Folks, get
ready to dance.
Nicolas Cage is fantastic as our favorite EMS technician. I'm not even
sure this performance doesn't surpass the one he is best known for:
Leaving Las Vegas. He is perfect in a movie that's far from it. To say
that he is above his material would be a gross understatement. I've
always thought that John Goodman was a very talented actor and his turn
here certainly does not disprove that. He doesn't get as much
screentime as I would have liked to see, but he makes himself known.
Ving Rhames is an actor famous for his onscreen presence even more than
his tremendous acting ability, and he reinforces that. His character is
the film's most memorable aside from Cage's.
One performance I didn't like here was that of Patricia Arquette, who
is rather flat as Pierce's apparent love interest. The character, too,
is a curious one at best. She seems to act as nothing more as a device;
a tool to squeeze as much pathos as humanly possible out of our
protagonist. She is never defined as a person and we are never given
any reason to care about her other than Pierce's attachment to her, and
that's not enough.
Bringing Out the Dead is a reasonably entertaining but very uneven
movie. It brings together a dream team of performance and a set of
priceless individual moments without piecing them all together
convincingly. Scenes work but the movie never gets off the ground
because the story isn't as interesting to us as Scorcese presumes it to
be. I reveled in the script's details without getting involved in, or
particularly enjoying its main storyline.
Look: this isn't a horrible movie by any stretch of the imagination. I
don't think the post 1975 Scorcese could possibly make one. What this
is, however, is a disappointing movie. It's better viewed as a
collection of vignettes rather than as a big whole. It just doesn't
work like that.

Review for Planet of the Apes (2001)
Starring Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham
Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Estella
Warren, Carey Hiroyuki-Tagawa. Directed by Tim Burton.
Rated PG-13.
Reading a review of Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes by
an internet critic I respect, I stumble upon this
quote: "So, a "reimagining," as Burton has been
calling it, of Planet of the Apes would surely be ripe
for Burton's brand of psychological autopsy. A human
man, alone among hostile, intelligent apes, unable to
relate to the uncivilized, subjugated homo sapiens he
encounters... Bring on the angst, the hero's twisted
self-torture, all the stuff that makes you wonder what
happened to the director as a child!"* The reviewer
then expressed her disappointment that the film was in
fact nothing like she expected, that Burton strayed
from his usual cathartic misfit tale, as riveting as
his best ones have been. The fact that her sentiment
was echoed in reviews around the country shows how
unfair the critical faculty has been to this gem of a
sci-fi movie. From Burton, everyone expected a movie
that is extraordinary in spirit; this one is simply
extraordinary in craft. It had to happen sometime, and
I don't think I mind.
Mark Wahlberg takes over Charlton Heston's role in the
original 60's Apes, but not his loincloth. He plays
Captain Leo Davidson, a scientist/astronaut who takes
a shuttle from his space station to go after an
escaped chimpanzee and gets caught in an electrical
storm that rockets him two hundred years into the
future. He crash-lands on a planet where -- you
guessed it -- apes rule and humans are caged and
enslaved.
The biggest difference between this set-up and that of
the original movie is that while the apes Heston had
to contend with were merely skeptical and
condescending, treating humans much like we treat
monkeys, the simians here are downright malevolent.
Tim Roth, cast somewhat against type, plays Thade, the
cruel, fearsome, rotten-to-the-core villain who
ridicules the human rights movement led by Ari (Helena
Bonham Carter). When Leo is captured and imprisoned,
Ari helps him escape the clutches of the corrupt slave
trader Limbo (Paul Giamatti) and lead a group of
humans to his crashed ship, showing them that humans
weren't always the subservient species.
Much has been made of the ending. I won't go into it
except to say that it isn't entirely "Burton's new
ending." It's truer to Pierre Boulle's novel than the
original movie was, though even here it's slightly
modified. But in all the hubbub about its plausibility
-- or lack thereof -- something has been lost, and
that is Burton's pure technical skill in staging an
action movie. He is as comfortable operating in this
alien world as he was in the dank, foggy woods of
Sleepy Hollow. His Apes is, in fact,
remarkable-looking, though many were put off by the
fact that it's not his trademark look. Why not let the
guy do something different?
Wahlberg makes for a good no-nonsense hero, and the
love triangle between him, Ari and a sexy human female
is, until the very end, only implied, sparing us a
potentially laughable subplot. The make-up effects by
the legendary Rick Baker are amazing, making the
original look even sillier by comparison. And Burton
keeps the movie skipping along at a nice pace,
stopping only to give us a look at Roth snarling
ferociously at the camera (and to give Heston a nifty
cameo).
This is as solid a summer movie as one can expect,
beautifully mounted, well-acted and with a nifty
shocker of an ending. More importantly, despite the
detractors' loud grumblings, this is a Tim Burton
film.

Title
Review for Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
Starring Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Sydney Pollock. Rated R.
Eyes Wide Shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in Stanley
Kubrick's final film, but it is an impressive achievement; a
mesmerizing, haunting, adult psychodrama about marriage, fidelity and
sex. It's a Stanley Kubrick film from beginning to end, consistently
exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long, continuous takes,
his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to
extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast (indeed, Eyes Wide
Shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously
laborious shoot: Kubrick, a renowned perfectionist, reportedly held his
cast "hostage" on the set for nearly a year).
In an uncharacteristic maneuver, Kubrick cast two big-name stars in the
lead roles, namely real-life husband and wife Tom Cruise and Nicole
Kidman. They play Bill and Alice Harford, a volatile couple who, during
the course of a couple nights, ponder the validity of the idea that a
husband and a wife must be faithful to each other. He is an M.D., she's
unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go
to a fancy party. At the affair, they are both propositioned and both
nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else.
When they return to their lavish New York apartment Kidman (after
smoking a dash of weed) inquires whether her husband had sex with two
models who approached him during the night. He (truthfully) says that he
did not and asks what happened with that Hungarian guy she was dancing
with. They proceed to argue until Alice tells her spouse a lustful
story: evidently some time ago, she had a thing for a young naval
officer. She admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with
Bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night.
Bill is jolted by Alice's story and we anticipate his reaction, but at
that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "show his face" at the
house of a just-deceased patient. This turns out to be the beginning of
a long and eventful night on the town. The daughter of the dead patient
hits on him but he wisely turns her down. He almost does the dirty deed
with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street. Then, through a
series of coincidences, he winds up at a gothic mansion where a
ritualistic (and frankly, creepy) orgy takes place, with costumed people
performing various public sex acts on each other. Erotic dread mounts as
Cruise (who's not supposed to be there) wonders the spacious halls
watching the "action" until he is discovered to be an outsider.
Much hoopla has been raised over the fact that Warner Bros. digitally
edited the orgy scene. With the help of a computer, they put in cloaked
figures to block some of the actual sex acts (they can still be seen,
just not in all their glory) in order to avoid the dreaded NC-17 rating.
European viewers will see the film as Kubrick envisioned it. Roger Ebert
calls the American version the "Austin Powers version," and many others
have bashed the alterations. I am of the potentially controversial
opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical
atmosphere.
The first thing one notices about Eyes Wide Shut is how it looks. This
is an artful, distinctively gorgeous production, shot in dark, moody
hues and featuring some elaborate, beautiful scenery. From the giant
mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the Christmas
party to the Harford's apartment, this film is always a pleasure to look
at. To boot, a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still.
At the core, behind the graphic, controversial content and unappealing
mood, this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of
fidelity. It looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as
unnerving rather than erotic. It's something superficial and yet
something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship. At the end, it
seems, Bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his
wife have for each other, more meaningful than anything he could ever
hope to find on the streets of New York.
Kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both Cruise and Kidman. Tom
is completely convincing as Dr. Harford, a man who seems guided solely
by destiny, with no control of the course his life will take. Nicole
projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her
performance is stunningly effective: she's headed for an Oscar nod. The
movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast, at the head
of which is director-cum-thespian Sidney Pollock, enigmatic and
articulate as Harford's mysterious friend.
Eyes Wide Shut is not perfect: the last hour could have used a slightly
more scissor-happy editor and both Cruise and Kidman are too good-
looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong
temptation to philander. Still, this is an important work from a great
director, and while it may not be on par with some of Stanley Kubrick's
best it is a worthy final film, a complex exploration of jealousy and
faithfulness.

Review for Supernova (2000)
 Starring James Spader, Angela Bassett, Peter Facinelli. Directed by
Walter Hill (pseudonyms be damned). Rated PG-13.
Isn't it the ultimate sign of a movie's cinematic ineptitude when you
can't think of much to say about it other than "it sucks"? One of the
first official year 2000 releases, Supernova is such a movie. I can't
seem to get past one-word adjectives with this one,
although "boring," "stupid" and "absurd" doesn't amount to much of a
review. A shame. I would have been able to save myself the chore of
desperately trying to elaborate. But c'est la vie. Here goes nothing.
I'll keep it short.
I suppose the first bad omen for Supernova came when director Walter
Hill (48 Hours) removed his name from the movie, requesting that it be
replaced with the pseudonym Thomas Lee. The film's fate was sealed in
many minds when struggling studio MGM declined to screen it for the
press, an event usually signifying a studio's lack of confidence in a
particular movie. Hill's and MGM's actions were prudent.
When the captain of medical space vessel Nightingale dies in a tragic
hyperjump accident, a reformed drug addict who is also the first
officer, for some reason (James Spader) is forced to take command. The
ship picks up a distress call from a nearby planet and, on arrival,
picks up one survivor from an apparent accident in an abandoned mining
colony. One of the crew members (Angela Bassett) knows this passenger,
who is played by Peter Facinelli, and has some bad feelings about it --
and we all know what that means.
This intergalactic hitchhiker is carrying some mysterious cargo -- a
jellylike substance the purpose of which is unknown, though it seems to
bring some form of pleasure to whoever touches it. Another one of the
crew members experiences this first hand; after spending a few minutes
partially inside this glob of goo, he does some impressive handstand
pushups. Evidently, touching this enigmatic egg-shaped thingie makes
you younger and stronger. How? Why? The movie never bothers to explain.
Soon enough though, Spader and Bassett are running around the ship like
mad, being chased by the all-of-a-sudden-superhuman Facinelli. To be
honest, I don't even remember exactly why. I just remember that I
didn't care. Supernova's plot suggested some more or less interesting
ideas, such as the ball of goo being an intergalactic time bomb, but
they are all dropped before they have a chance to develop into anything
truly intriguing. In fact, everything is dropped just so the actors can
have some fun running around what looks like an elaborate set.
Well, the effects are good, though there's hardly a studio movie with
bad special effects these days so I'm not sure whether that's so
remarkable an accomplishment. The performances are hardly worth talking
about. I'm not even sure I can call what's here "performances," though
Angela Bassett sure is good at giving people the finger. James Spader
is not a bad actor, but he proves to be one of the blandest action
stars I've seen in a while, mostly because he isn't given a character
with a personality. The action scenes are just as bland, since they're
pretty much just rehashes of action elements that weren't particularly
entertaining the first time around. And since the action scenes are
everything to this movie, it's pretty much dead in the water.
And for the life of me, I can't figure out why it's called Supernova.

Review for Forces of Nature (1999)
Forces of Nature (1999)
Reviewed by Eugene Novikov
http://www.ultimate-movie.com/forcesofnature.html
Member: Online Film Critics Society
Pacing has proved very important in comedies; consistency is almost always a
virtue (unless of course the subject in question is consistently unfunny).
When a movie is consistently amusing, it will always be a good one, no
matter how reprehensibly pointless said movie might be. But when a film
resembles a roller coaster; constantly changing from lively to slow, from
funny to pathetic, it becomes almost unredeemable because viewers almost
have to brace themselves for the next change of pace. The eagerly awaited
romantic comedy Forces of Nature is so wildly inconsistent, it plays lke a
roller coaster. And as much as I love roller coasters, films that are roller
coasters often prove to be a bit too much -- or, sometimes, too little.
Sandra Bullock's talent has been universally underutilized. She's been an
action hero in Speed and The Net, she's been in kitschy love stories (does
While You Were Sleeping ring a bell), and now she's cast in this minefield
of a role; but she has been in nary a serious role, one where she could
really show off her acting chops. Why not? I have no clue, because as she
has demonstrated over the course of her career, and as she demonstrates in
Forces of Nature she is a much more versatile, capable and entertaining
actress than she's been given credit for.
Here, she is the shining star in an otherwise dull and bland sky. She plays
Sara Lewis, a seemingly happy-go-lucky chick who meets up with the film's
real protagonist when their plane crashes (without taking off). The point of
Forces of Nature is really to track the course of "jacket copyrighter" Ben
Holmes' journey from New York to Georgia for his wedding. After the
aforementioned plane crash, Holmes decides to play it safe with ground
transportation, and Sara drags along. What follows is a drug bust, a
hurricane, a mistaken identity caper and, of course, a shopping spree at
Kmart. Can Holmes get to his wedding in time? Do we care?
During the journey we find that Sara is not really as free and careless as
she seems. We discover that the deceptively assured Holmes is really quite
insecure about the marriage that he is about to enter. And of course
everything goes wrong down in Georgia where his impatient wife and her
impatient parents are going nuts over the fact that it's taking Holmes two
days to get from New York to Savannah for his wedding. But we never feel any
sense of urgency about Holmes' tardiness, nor do we experience any emotional
connection to Sara or much sympathy for her troubled life.
Forces of Nature is a feather-light comedy that aims low and achieves less.
Bullock is indeed excellent, and her portrayal of a free spirit is
momentarily uplifting. Ben Affleck on the other hand proves too likeable for
his own good, to the point where he is not a real person but a cloying
mechanism to suck up to the audience. Some of the movie's sequences shine,
such as the scene where Affleck is gently forced to strip at a gay bar, but
some are forced and catastrophically implausible -- would you believe that
two people could climb on top of a train full of passengers and start
screaming at the top of their lungs without anyone so much as noticing? Or
that any self-respecting human being would literally try to hitchhike from
New York to Georgia?
Director Bronwen Hughes (Harriet the Spy) stages some hilarious scenes but
also some that make you cringe and some that are all too predictable.
Consider, for example, the part where Holmes poses as a doctor on a bus full
of seniors. Can you guess what happens next?
There are moments when Forces of Nature seems truly alive and throbbing with
joy. But overwhelmingly the movie is ordinary and sub-par as a romantic
comedy. The only part of the film that hints at any substance is its
love-it-or-hate-it ending, which I will not go so far as reveal. Some
viewers will eat it up thinking it is the only segment of the film that has
any depth. More superficial moviegoers (not that there's anything wrong with
that) may feel cheated because the conclusion gives the viewer a feeling
that the past two hours were completely pointless. But of course, many will
feel that they were pointless anyway.

Review for Return to Me (2000)
Starring David Duchovny, Minnie Driver, Bonnie Hunt, James Belushi,
Robert Loggia, Carroll O'Connor, David Alan Grier. Directed by Bonnie
Hunt. Rated PG.
A new meaning is given to the expression "matters of the heart" in the
farfetched, graceful new romantic comedy Return to Me. It stars
David "Agent Mulder" Duchovny, in his second non-X-Files lead role (his
first came in 1997, in the gigantic flop Playing God), who impresses
with his charisma and comic timing, and Minnie Driver, whose smile is
simply contagious. This is an exuberant but non-manipulative fairy tale
about love prevailing over the most bizarre of circumstances.
The wife of architect/construction worker Bob Rueland (Duchovny) dies
in a tragic car accident. We don't see it happen because director
Bonnie Hunt wanted to preserve the gentle PG rating and because it
doesn't really matter how it happened, only that it did. She was an
organ donor. Her heart was healthy; it is given to Grace Briggs
(Driver), a woman who has lost almost all hope for getting one. The
transplant goes well, and although Grace is destined to live with a
visible scar on her chest, her prognosis is excellent.
Things aren't so hunky-dory with Bob, however. He hasn't stopped
grieving. He doesn't go out. His veterinarian friend (David Alan Grier)
is desperately trying to get him to live again, but it doesn't seem to
be working. The one time Bob does go out on a date, it's a disaster.
Even his dog hasn't gotten over its master's demise; every day when Bob
enters the house, the dog remains at the door, waiting for Mrs. Rueland
to come in after him.
Bob and Grace meet, of course. They both have the feeling that they've
seen each other before, which they really haven't. They fall in love.
Neither have any idea how they are related to each other. For once,
it's a relationship based not on a mood swing or a passionate desire
based on appearances. Instead it's two people who genuinely like each
other -- that is, each thinks the other is a nice person who is fun to
be around. It's genuine: we really feel that these two people may have
a future together.
The idea at the movie's core is farfetched, even ludicrous. The chances
that these two people would actually meet and fall in love without
realizing the situation are negligible. But it doesn't matter. First-
time director Bonnie Hunt, who also stars as Grace's wise-cracking
girlfriend doesn't linger on the specifics. The heart-transplant
subplot is a means to an end rather than an end in itself. After the
first 20 minutes, when the plot is set in motion, Return to Me is about
its characters rather than the situation they are in. The result is a
sweet love story, far more affecting than the average romantic drivel
because it's so much less phony.
The surprise here is David Duchovny. Until now, the X-Files star has
failed miserably on the big screen (except, obviously, in the X-Files
movie) and I was ready to consider him incapable of playing anyone
other than the obsessed Agent Mulder. In Return to Me, we discover his
penchant for comedy. I wouldn't star him in a slapstick extravaganza
but his everyday Joe appeal turns out to be perfect for the sort of
sentimental shtick that abounds here.
Here's the ultimate pitch for Return to Me: you'll laugh, you'll cry,
you won't have the temptation to puke. The biggest problem with movie
love stories, perhaps, is that some of them are sappy and fake, their
emotions exaggerated to the point where we cringe, not believing a
frame of what we're seeing. Granted, a man probably wouldn't fall in
love with a woman who has his dead wife's heart. But the emotions here
are true.

Title
Review for Limey, The (1999)
Starring Terrence Stamp, Peter Fonda. Directed by Steven Soderbergh.
Rated R.
Out of Sight director Steven Sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all
in The Limey, a cold, uninvolving, confusing new thriller. Though the
plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of Elmore
Leonard (author of Out of Sight, as well as Jackie Brown, Get Shorty
and Pulp Fiction), after you watch it, you realize that it's not nearly
good enough.
In an aggressively non-linear fashion, The Limey (li*mey, noun: an
English gentleman) tells the story of Wilson (Terrence Stamp), a
British ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed
robbery. He has come to the US to seek vengeance for the death of his
daughter Jenny. He doesn't know much about the circumstances of her
demise, all he has is a name: Terry Valentine. Valentine was Jenny's
former boyfriend, a wealthy and corrupt record executive. He's played
by Peter Fonda, in his first major role since the terrific Ulee's Gold
in 1997.
Seeking Valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no
easy task for Wilson. He finally finds the impressive abode high in the
mountains and sneaks in just as Valentine is having a big party. He
winds up breaking his cover eventually, setting off Valentine's head of
security and Valentine himself, who decides to run for it.
What a mess. I have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by
the linearity of time -- Pulp Fiction, which twisted time every which
way, was a masterpiece -- but I do take exception to movies that decide
to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer.
The Limey does exactly that. The plot is permeated with flashbacks,
flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel,
without any evident purpose. There is no method to this movie's
madness. It uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off
told more conventionally and more comprehendably.
The plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place:
traditional, mildly hackneyed and not very involving. This is a sort of
brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action
sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude. I felt like
the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself, almost
like he made this film for a paycheck. Ditto for the editing, which
seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant.
Sixties icon Terrence Stamp manages to at least be menacing as the
aging criminal. He's not much in the way of stature but he has a
surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage
here. Peter Fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor: he's shy, quiet
but always effective. He's adept at conveying emotions through speech
rather than expression: his feelings don't always show on his face by
you can always tell what they are.
This is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously
bizarre fashion. Why Soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a
story, I don't know, but what he does do certainly doesn't work. The
result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil --
even the action scenes don't work. 1999 may have signified the death of
the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline, but obviously
some movies have not yet transcended it. Shall we go back to basics?

Review for Zbogum na dvadesetiot vek (1998)
"The future is as screwed up as the past."
Starring Lazar Ristovski. Not Rated (the equivalent of a strong R, for
gory violence and an explicit sex scene).
Goodbye, 20th Century is one of only six films produced in the Republic
of Macedonia. It's the only one of the six that I have seen and it
hasn't made me especially eager to see more. It's a frenetic,
nonsensical doo-hickey of a science fiction movie that makes no effort
to be at all coherent and, as such, is a big mess. It's utterly
pointless -- or maybe it's just me. Either way, I'm at a loss.
The film is composed of three vignettes. The first plays like a
pornographic Tuck Everlasting. In a post-apocalyptic society, a man is
condemned to eternal life until he frees himself of the curse by having
sex with his sister. Or something. The second is brief and is "set" at
the end of the 19th century. This one might have something to do with
someone marrying his own sister. Or something. The last one concerns a
deranged Santa Claus on New Year's Eve 1999 and ends in a bloodbath and
the words "Goodbye, 20th Century!"
Or something. I don't know. Maybe it would have all become clearer on
repeat viewing, but I wasn't going to go through that. The fact of the
matter is, to a one-time viewer not familiar with Macedonian cinema,
Goodbye, 20th Century makes absolutely no sense. Lines and characters
seem to come out of nowhere, without any apparent thought behind them.
The running theme of incest is at best curious and at worst repulsive;
either way, why it's there remains a mystery. The film also tries to
interweave the three stories, but the result is even more disjointed.
There may well be some ideas brimming underneath the surface here, in
which case they simply never see the light of day.
>From a purely technical perspective, this is a reasonably well-made
movie. Action scenes are filmed with an effectively surrealistic style
and there is enough deft camerawork to justify the filmmakers being in
the business. The sets are gorgeously bleak and they don't reek of a
low budget. I also like the way the film's finale was staged and
filmed, though I didn't really understand that either. Goodbye, 20th
Century has enough visual panache that, if coupled with a good plot,
which it is laughing, it would be a fair contender for the Best Foreign
Film Oscar this year.
I can't help but think that there was something profound that directors
Darko Mitrevski and Aleksandar Popovski were trying to tell us here. If
only I knew what it was. Before I can perceive understated messages I
have to at least get a jist of the main story line and with this film I
wasn't even fully successful there. In fact, nobody can be expected to
understand the theme of a movie before they figure out what it is
about. That should be the #1 piece of advice at film schools everywhere.
There is no way I can completely dismiss this film considering its
technical proficiency and the nagging possibility that, um, I didn't
get it. But my argument stands: to most American filmgoers, Goodbye,
20th Century will remain a mystery. The story never came together
sufficiently to work on any level other than the visual.

Review for Winslow Boy, The (1999)
Starring Nigel Hawthorne, Jeremy Northam, Rebecca Pidgeon, Gemma Jones.
Rated G.
David Mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director. With
his distinctive, more often than not ingenious dialogue, and his laid
back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely
irresistible. Some of them tend to be thickly layered, deceptive
productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less
superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern
its concealed message, or sometimes even a concealed storyline. And
although the real plot in his new project The Winslow Boy is slightly
more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors, it is still a
brilliantly complex, consistently riveting motion picture about honor,
about sacrifice, and about the difference between what is commonly known
as justice and what is right. Oh, and it's rated G.
Incidentally, this is the first time that Mamet has decided to adapt
someone else's work; namely a play by Terrence Rattigan, set in the 19th
Century. He casts Nigel Hawthorne in the lead role as Arthur Winslow, a
rich, aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son Ronnie has been
kicked out of the Naval Academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling
postal note. "Did you do it?" he asks his boy. "No father, I didn't,"
Ronnie answers. That's enough for Arthur, who, with his oldest daughter
(Rebecca Pidgeon), immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case
to court. They enlist the help of Sir Robert Morton, a notorious
attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task.
It all seems fairly frivolous, and no matter how you look at it, the
Winslow Case is not the trial of the century. But Arthur is determined
to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to
make sure of that. Soon enough, Sir Robert Morton along with the rest of
the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings. So do we.
All David Mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue,
but his style is still fairly apparent. The characters still talk in his
trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in
conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense. But
this is not Mamet's norm, and it's refreshing to see Mamet deviate from
his world of crooks, gangsters as con men, wonderful as those films
were.
Nigel Hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless. His delivery is that
of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his
own game. We pity the man, but we also like him. Rebecca Pidgeon, David
Mamet's wife, who gave a fairly awful performance in The Spanish
Prisoner is at the top of her game here as Arthur's oldest daughter, a
flailing feminist who gives her all to the Winslow case as a way for
making up for her lack of success in the Women's Suffrage Movement.
The Winslow Boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a
seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to
make a real impact rather than a phony one. Be honest: did you feel
anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like A Time
To Kill? If you wanted to but didn't, this is a movie for you. It is the
epitome of subtlety: it's powerful without being too emotional, sad
without even trying to be depressing.
David Mamet can churn out some great scripts, but in this movie he
proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell
of a director too. He is almost a national treasure. His films deserve
their own genre.

Review for Whole Nine Yards, The (2000)
Starring Matthew Perry, Bruce Willis, Rosanna Arquette, Michael Clarke
Duncan, Natasha Henstrige, Toni Colette. Directed by Jonathan Lynn.
Rated R.
The Whole Nine Yards is a sublime semi-romantic caper comedy,
cartoonishly convoluted but (more or less) consistently hilarious.
Aside from a rare comedic performance by Bruce Willis, this is mostly
stuff we've seen before. But director Jonathan Lynn, who literally cut-
and-pasted the premise from his own 1992 hit My Cousin Vinny into the
1997 comedy Trial and Error and made it work, has a flair for bringing
old ideas into a fresh light. The secret to this movie's success isn't
the plot, which is contrived and rather absurd, but likable
performances and a funny, energetic script.
Friends's Matthew Perry plays Nick Ozaransky, a very unhappily married
dentist living in Quebec. One day Nick realizes that the person who
just moved in next door to him is actually Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski
(Willis), a notorious contract killer. Jimmy has a price on his head
himself: Chicago gangster Yanni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack) wants Jimmy
dead for killing his father. Nick's antichrist of a wife ships him off
to Chicago to rat Jimmy out to Yanni and collect the finder's fee.
In Chicago, Nick meets up with Frankie Figs (The Green Mile's Michael
Clarke Duncan), an associate of Yanni. He is instructed to go back to
Canada with Frankie and help kill Tudeski. But The Tulip has plans of
his own. You see, Nick's wife wants Nick dead so she looks around for a
good hit man; in the process, she tells Jimmy what Nick is doing in
Chicago. When Gogolack and his gang arrive, Jimmy will be waiting.
But of course a movie like this would not be complete without a love
subplot so Nick falls for Jimmy's wife. The kicker is that Jimmy, his
wife, and Yanni have a collective 10 million dollars lying in a bank.
To claim the money, they need the signatures of the three people, two
signatures and a death certificate or one signature and two death
certificates. Thus, Jimmy wants to kill both Yanni and his wife,
claiming all the money for himself. Lovesick Nick can't let that
happen, of course, but can he really do anything about it?
There's a whole lot going on here, even more than I cared to explain,
and not all of it makes sense. But The Whole Nine Yards tackles its
plot with such unapologetically cheerful gusto that you can't help but
like it. It's hard to tell whether the film is aware of its own
absurdity and is winking slyly as it takes its goofy script and runs
with it or whether it has no idea and just doesn't care but I'm leaning
towards the latter. It never seems to flinch, back away or make
excuses; it just romps its way through the story.
Matthew Perry has made a career of always playing the straight man, the
one person remaining rational when everyone around him goes loony. He's
done it in his tv show, the underrated 1999 movie Three To Tango and is
continuing that trend here. I never seem to get sick of his sarcastic,
cynical style; the actor can do more with subtle gestures and facial
expressions than some comedians can with a rubber face or a script full
of monologues. His masterful comic delivery can make even slightly lame
one-liners riotous.
Playing alongside Perry is Bruce Willis, an actor not known to do comic
roles which is a shame. His performance here is superior to almost any
given pre-Sixth Sense role he's taken. Willis's Jimmy Tudeski is the
polar opposite of Perry's Nick, a wry, smug, almost omnipotent criminal
ready to kill at the blink of an eye and Willis plays him perfectly,
often underplaying scenes thereby making his character creepily
volatile as well as funny.
There's a scene in The Whole Nine Yards in which Willis and Perry are
standing on a moving boat. Perry is astonished about something that I
will not reveal and the unperturbed Willis throws him a beer. Perry is
far too ruffled to catch it and the beer flies on by and off the boat.
A lesser movie might have lingered on this admittedly funny gag and
killed the joke. But without so much as a pause, The Whole Nine Yards
just continues on its merry way.

Review for eXistenZ (1999)
Starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law, Ian Holm, Willem Dafoe. Rated R.
It's odd how movies tend come in pairs or in threes. Last year we had two
asteroid movies and two computer animated movies about bugs open at about the
same time, and many Hollywood analysts have commented on the strangeness of
the situation. In 1999, we are lucky enough to receive three -- count 'em --
three movies about virtual reality and video games of the mind. The first of
the group was The Matrix, an exquisite, exciting thriller that still sticks
with me almost a month after I first saw it. In May, Roland Emmerich,
director of the abysmal Independence Day and Godzilla will produce The
Thirteenth Floor which seems very similar to The Matrix.
But even without having seen The Thirteenth Floor I can tell you right now
that the weirdest of the bunch is far and away David Cronenberg's eXistenZ
(pronounced sort of like "existence" but with the accent on the last
syllable), a genuinely odd, sexually charged meditation on distortion of our
perceptions, video games' increasing tendency to try and imitate reality as
well as -- perhaps -- the fear of sex. It is a movie that exists in almost a
dreamlike state, eminently watchable but too bizarre to really involve its
audience personally. That is not a criticism, but only a statement.
Allegra Geller, a hot young game designer is ready to try out her new virtual
reality game "eXistenZ," but not all goes as planned. Shouting out the
kitschy slogan "Death to the Demon Allegra Geller," a visitor attacks with a
gun made of flesh and bone. Fortunately, Geller and a guy named Ted (Jude
Law) are able to escape and hide out.
The game controllers called fleshpods are likewise made of flesh -- they're
living things. And to make sure that her game pod still works and that her
game is safe inside it, Geller decides to play a round with Ted.
Even though that doesn't sound like much of a plot, it is and you'll
understand why if you see this meticulously structured, deeply layered
vision. Canadian director David Cronenberg, who made last year's
controversially shallow Crash is out to frighten us in eXistenZ, with
fittingly gory, convincing effects as well as spooky ideas running throughout
the film.
Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an energetic performance as Allegra and the
charismatic Jude Law plays the opposite of his self-confident Gattaca
character in eXistenZ. Law's Ted is a video game virgin who is forced to
learn fast to perhaps save himself and Allegra. Ian Holm has a terrific
supporting role in the game -- he does a mean accent, even though I don't
know what accent that was supposed to be.
eXistenZ is curiously alluring. Despite the occasionally repulsive gore, the
movie's slow, steady pace and offbeat rhythm are almost hypnotic. David
Cronenberg did a very good job of making me interested in the plot while
keeping me slightly detached, at an observing distance, if you will, thus
letting the story work as an allegory more than a horror film or a thriller.
Cronenberg's deftness behind the camera, attractive performances from the
leads as well as a few subtle, hidden universal themes make eXistenZ a
keeper. And if he doesn't go back to the likes of Crash, David Cronenberg is
a keeper too. Š1999 Eugene Novikov

Review for Score, The (2001)
"Don't leave me on the sidelines when it comes time to
collect, don't do it!"
Starring Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Marlon Brando,
Angela Bassett. Directed by Frank Oz. Rated R.
Just a few weeks ago, I lamented that Swordfish didn't
have the humility to simply be a good heist movie. The
Score is like that film's twin, sans computers,
impromptu blow jobs and Travolta with a goatee. Only
this one is a good heist movie, flawed but thoroughly
competent, with an amazing cast and precise, almost
Mametian dialogue. Films like these are woefully hard
to find: though it has irony a-plenty, it doesn't have
any of the post-modern "edge" that audiences seem to
dig. The heist here seems to be just like any other.
...except that it's set in Montreal. Not just filmed
in Montreal, set in Montreal. And why not? It's such a
nice city that it's a shame to see it rampaged by
thieves, which is why the protagonist of The Score,
professional thief Nick Wells (Robert De Niro) has a
policy: never do jobs in your hometown. It never leads
to anything good. This is part of the reason for his
skepticism when his old friend Max (Marlon Brando)
approaches him with a proposition to rob the Montreal
Customs House; the other part is his girlfriend
(Angela Bassett), who has promised to move in with him
if he'll only retire.
After some prodding, of course, Nick agrees to One
Last Heist, which teams him with an intelligent and
ambitious budding criminal Jack (Edward Norton), who
has infiltrated the Customs House posing as a retarded
janitor. The target is a priceless scepter that was
once owned by a royal family and later intercepted by
customs when someone tried to hide it inside of a
piano leg. The security around it is tight but nothing
insurmountable, and Jack knows the building like the
back of his hand. But Nick, a seasoned veteran, likes
to work slowly and exclusively on his terms, making
Jack agree that what he says, goes.
Before the end credits roll, loyalties are tested, and
people are crossed, double-crossed and crossed again
(though I don't think anyone gets killed, which is
amazing for a modern actioner). The reason to watch
The Score, though, isn't the plot, which is about as
simple as it gets (thieves find target, thieves plan
heist, thieves pull heist), but the interplay between
the three actors at its forefront.
No actor radiates a fierce, dangerous intelligence as
well as Ed Norton, and this ability has landed him
some of the most enviably challenging roles Hollywood
had to offer. His Jack isn't as risque as the
"Narrator" in Fight Club, but his wavering
is-he-a-villain-or-isn't-he status gives Norton plenty
of opportunities to toy with the audience. More than
anything, it resembles his debut role in Primal Fear,
which also hid a smart, scheming criminal under the
guise of mental retardation.
The climax is a great payoff for what was a slow, if
interesting, first two acts, but I didn't much like
the ending, which is a little too pat and predictable
for my tastes. I don't want to give away too much, but
the final phone-conversation "shocker" isn't much of a
shocker at all. Still, I prefer The Score's
unpretentious conclusion to Swordfish's, which
apparently thought that if it confused us enough, we'd
praise it to pretend that we understood it. It's a
fitting end to a solid, unremarkable film. 

Title
Review for Mansfield Park (1999)
Starring Frances O'Conner, Jonny Lee Miller, Embeth Davidtz, Alessandro
Nivola, Harold Pinter, Lindsay Duncan. Rated PG-13.
Jane Austen has her own subgenre, with 16 movies adapted from her
novels since 1940. Aside from Clueless, however, there hasn't been much
creative variety in the films; they've been more or less similar in
setting and style. Like John Grisham films, Jane Austen, genius as her
work is, gets old after a while. We've been needing a director to do
something new with one of her novels, to go where no one has gone
before. That wish will not be granted by Patricia Rozema's Mansfield
Park, a reasonably entertaining, altogether unoriginal film version of
one of Austen's least populist works.
The much analyzed protagonist of the story is Fanny Price who was given
away by her well-intentioned but poverty-stricken mother to live in
Mansfield Park, her pretentious aunt's wealthy household. She is
shunned and treated like a servant by everyone except Edmund, one of
her cousins. Over the years, Edmund and Fanny develop a close, but
platonic relationship; he is her first defender, she is his first
confidant and vice versa.
Matters are complicated by the arrival of Henry, a good-looking
aristocrat who takes an immediate interest in Fanny. He courts her and
proposes marriage, but Fanny doesn't trust him and, though interested,
is very hesitant to commit to him, even pulling a 19th century version
of The Runaway Bride on the poor chap. Sir Thomas, the head of Fanny's
household, insists that she mary the desirable Henry, threatening to
kick her out of Mansfield Park should she refuse.
Frances O'Conner, in a lovely performance and a difficult role, plays
Fanny, a complex and demanding character which O'Conner pulls off
deftly. Jonny Lee Miller, last seen in the pathetic Plunkett and
Macleane is tender and effective as Edmund while the little seen Harry
Pinter is terrifically menacing as the head of the manor. Lindsay
Duncan has a fairly thankless part as the conniving, despicable Lady
Bertram but she succeeds with repulsive perfection. The only weak link
in the cast (and of course, a chain is only as strong as its weakest
link) is Alessandro Nivola whose Henry is dull and standard,
undermining the dilemma at the heart of the movie: from Nivola's
portrayal it isn't difficult to see why Fanny never went ga-ga over the
guy.
Rozema's film is funny, melodramatic, and enjoyable. The pace is
reasonably fast, the direction is able and the mood is nothing short of
crowd-pleasing. At the end, the good guys prosper and the bad guys get
their comeuppance. Everything is dandy. Everything is also tiresomely
ordinary. There is not a speck of originality in this film; the setting
and the script have been done and redone countless times, even if the
story itself has been left untouched (sans a 1983 tv mini-series).
Things that we see for the first time in the movie already feel
repetitive because we've seen them so many times in movies past. This
is your basic British melodrama ŕ la Jane Eyre and Sense and
Sensibility, with virtually no variations on the formula.
Jane Austen deserves a revival. She is a wonderful novelist who needs a
filmmaker to breathe fresh life into her work. Mansfield Park is a
perfectly good adaptation, but it's trite. She is suffering from John
Grisham syndrome.

Title
Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
"Not every situation requires your patented approach of shoot first,
shoot later, shoot some more and then when everybody's dead try to ask a
question or two."
Starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek, Kenneth Branagh. Rated
PG-13.
Will Smith owns the July 4th weekend. The last two summers, a box-office
smash has been released on the July 4th weekend and each of them has
starred Will Smith. Those blockbusters were, of course, Independence Day
and Men In Black. After both of them more than tripled their respective
budgets ($75 million for ID4 and $90 million for MIB), Warner Bros.
decided to raise the stakes this year with Wild Wild West. The studio
poured $175 million dollars into the project, making it the second most
expensive film of all time.
This exuberant action-comedy romp is the second in a couple of dubious
remakes that have been thrown our way this year (the first, a special-
effects extravaganza called The Mummy was supposedly a remake of a 1932
movie starring Boris Karloff, but the two have nothing in common beyond
the fact that they are about mummies). It is a remake of an old tv show
of the same name, but a lot has changed. Jim West (played by Will Smith
as opposed to Robert Conrad) is a secret service agent working for
President Ulysses S. Grant. He is paired with Artemis Gordon (Kevin
Kline, funny by just showing up), a US Marshal, master of disguise and
maker of wacky crime-fighting gizmos that would make Inspector Gadget
proud. Together they must stop Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh, a
delight), a legless Confederate war general with a hairbrained scheme to
take over the US government.
Wild Wild West also stars Salma Hayek as Rita Escobar, a role that
exists for the sole purpose of attracting horny teenagers. Hayek (From
Dusk Till Dawn, Fools Rush In) must have been desperate for work to
accept this thankless role. Kline and Branagh, on the other hand have
plenty to flaunt in this movie. As the villain, Branagh takes a break
from Shakespeare and employs a weird accent to play Dr. Loveless with
occasionally hilarious gusto, and he seems to be having the time of his
life. Kline, in a dual role (he also puts on a fake beard and mustache
to play the President), brings to Artemis Gordon an entertaining
attitude, sparing what might have been an irritating character.
Unfortunately Will Smith, the star of the show, is just plain annoying,
cocky and unlikeable.
Director Barry Sonnenfeld (Addams Family Values, Men in Black) never
lets his movie fully become a parody, although it often heads in that
direction. As such, however, Wild Wild West is wretchedly inconsistent;
often amusing but also frequently tedious. For every gag that entertains
there are two that choke. For every scene with at least a trace of
excitement, two more are yawn-worthy. Admittedly, parts of Wild, Wild
West are fun (mostly those with Branagh), but overwhelmingly the film
fails to reach the level of suspense and humor necessary for it to
really work as an action-comedy.
By the time the much-lauded giant mechanical tarantula shows up it is
clear that this film is out of its element. If there is such a thing as
overbudgeting, this is it, folks. There is no room for eye-popping
special effects here. Wild, Wild West wants to thrive on camp (as well
as what is often referred to as "cheesiness"), but it's hard to be campy
with a 175 million dollar budget. A director would have to make sure the
film is discreet, and discreet Wild, Wild West is not.
Will Smith is a terrific actor, but here we never warm up to him or his
character. His Jim West is a creep, not the admirable role-model that a
hero of this movie should have been. It's a real problem when the
protagonist is a jerk because the burden falls on the supporting
characters who then have to do a spectacular job to make up for the
protagonist's lack of potency. Branagh and Kline are capable of doing
just that, and would have succeeded brilliantly were this a better
movie. But there isn't enough spark in the proceedings for the two
veterans to really blow are minds, although their performances are as
terrific as the movie permits them to be.
Wild Wild West will still be a huge draw and will do Warner Bros. proud.
But frankly, it's a letdown; not necessarily because it isn't
consistently funny or consistently exciting (I wasn't expecting a
masterpiece) but because I wasn't prepared to see such inanity from Will
Smith.

Review for Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001)
"Come on, Silent Bob! We're going to Hollywood."
Starring Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Will Ferrell,
Shannon Elizabeth, Seann William Scott, Chris Rock,
Jason Lee, Ben Affleck. Directed by Kevin Smith. Rated
R.
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is a dumb movie
disguised in a smarmy interior. Kevin Smith, coming
off the wonderful, challenging Dogma, fills it with
sub-Road Trip gross-out jokes and expects us to buy it
because he's just oh-so-ironic. But when a movie is so
self-aware it becomes about nothing but itself, we can
hardly be expected to pay for admission.
Jay and Silent Bob, two New Jersey stoners who hang
out at the doorstep of convenience store selling pot,
have appeared in almost all of Smith's movies but, if
I'm not mistaken, have not starred in one until now.
They find out that there is a movie based on the comic
book that is based on them being made in Hollywood.
This presents two problems: a) they haven't received a
penny in royalties and b) nerds on the internet
("What's the internet?") are talking trash about them.
What is there to do except go to Hollywood and stop
this movie from being made?
On the way -- they're hitchhiking, because who knew
you needed tickets to take a bus? -- they run into a
group of hotties who pretend to be with an
animal-rights group, but are really jewel thiefs who
parade around in Charlie's Angels-style outfits. Of
course, they set Jay and Silent Bob up to look like
the thieves, so that there is a massive manhunt going
on during the second half of the film. Will Ferrell,
who again proves himself incapable of doing anything
but sketch comedy, shows up as the wildlife marshal
inspector who thinks the two have stolen a monkey.
The movie will probably please only Smith's die-hard,
undiscerning fans; everyone else will be critical of
this mind-bogglingly stupid effort following some the
sophisticated cinema that he churned out in years
past. Any appeal the movie has will come from the "in"
jokes, most of which I think I understood, but the
movie is "in" to the point of absurdity. There needs
to be something holding it together other than its own
smugness.
Once Jay and Silent Bob get to Hollywood, the movie
abruptly switches gears from gross-out comedy to
ridiculously broad Hollywood satire. Countless "hot"
movie stars and personalities make an appearance, from
Smith veterans Matt Damon and Ben Affleck to Wes
Craven, but Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back resorts to
such low-brow gags as another Scream sequel with a
monkey as the killer. Get it? They're so desperate for
another movie, they ran out of ideas and used a
monkey! A monkey!
As often happens with writers who are working below
what they are actually capable of, most of the really
good lines are throwaways, while the big, painstaking
gags mostly fall flat. One of the funniest lines in
the movie flies by: when asked to comment on the
clitoris (don't ask), Jay responds: "the female
clitoris?"
Kevin Smith is a talented writer (though I agree that
his films would be better off if he'd let a real
director take the helm), and Jay and Silent Bob Strike
Back holds true to his promise to make a more
facetious film. Unfortunately, it's also shapeless,
pointless and largely unfunny. Smith's "verbal
trampoline," as Ben Affleck once called his
distinctive dialogue, takes a back seat to his dubious
instincts as a populist filmmaker. This was supposed
to be the movie that didn't offend anyone, but it's
offensive because it's terrible.
