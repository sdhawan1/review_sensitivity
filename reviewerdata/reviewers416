Title
Review for Kiss the Girls (1997)
Starring: Ashley Judd, Morgan Freeman, Cary Elwes, and Gina Ravera 
Ingredients: 
kindly forensic cop psychologist, brave young lady doctor, devious
serial killer/kidnapper, abducted young women, trees, mist
Synopsis:
In this intelligent, suspenseful thriller Washington DC police
psychologist Dr. Alex Cross (Morgan Freeman) and spunky North Carolina
physician Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd) team up to match wits against
Cassanova,' a devious rapist/killer whose identity remains a mystery
until the movie's last scene.
Alex's college-aged niece Naomi (Gina Ravera) is the most recent victim
in a series of abductions of women, three of whom have already turned up
dead.  The police attribute the murder/rapes to a methodical serial
rapist/killer who thus far has left no prints, fiber, semen, or hair.
Believing the remaining women and his niece might still be alive,
softspoken Alex begins a dogged investigation.
Meanwhile beautiful Dr. Kate McTiernan (Ashley Judd), is stalked,
drugged, abducted, and imprisoned by Cassanova. Kate manages a desperate
escape into the forest, but because of the amnesiac effects of the drug,
she can only remember vaguely when she is questioned at the hospital by
Alex. What's worse, Kate is wracked by guilt for leaving the other
prisoners behind. 
Natural allies, Kate and Alex join forces to locate the abducted women
and solve the mystery of Cassanova's identity. But are they hunting
Cassanova, or is Cassanova hunting them?
Opinion:
The mood is set by careful cinematography and plot. For example, the
rapist attacks on a stormy night; the heroes launch their assault on the
villain's lair at dusk; light symbolizes escape, and; trees and fog
symbolize confusion. 
Kiss the Girls' hooked me into trying to figure out the identity of the
(masked) serial killer, because of its grim suspenseful mood, solid
characters, believable clues, and the occasional clever plot twist. I
left the theater for the most part satisfied, with the gears and clues
still clicking away in my head.

Title
Review for Spanish Prisoner, The (1997)
Starring: Campbell Scott, Rebecca Pidgeon, Steve Martin
Synopsis:
>From the title you might imagine THE SPANISH PRISONER is about a
mysterious American who is unjustly trapped in a Spanish prison and must
use superior wits and gut-level instinct to escape ruthless tormentors.
But actually THE SPANISH PRISONER has nothing to do with either Spain or
prisoners. It's a con game tale whose focus is not so much on the
battle, but on details of the con, and the soul-less-ness of society.
THE SPANISH PRISONER is written and directed by David Mamet, a Pulitzer
prize winning playwright who views cinema as an extension of live
theater. Mamet is known for making frequent use of artsy soundbyte
Shakespeare dialogue. He often uses theater as a medium for advancing
social commentary and scathing indictments of societal superficiality.
The actual plot:
The term Spanish Prisoner refers to a popular con game, which is
mentioned in passing by characters in the movie. The main character Joe
(Campbell Scott) is a brilliant scientific inventor and a resourceful
scout, to the extent that he still keeps his trusty boy scout knife with
him. But in this situation Joe is the exact opposite of clever and
resourceful. For example, when people ask him to carry a suspicious
package through airport security, he willingly obliges: twice. Joe
accepts money not knowing where it has come from, and buys an extremely
expensive item for a blind date whom he has never met. Nor can he decide
between dating a sexy coworker or hanging around with a bath-robed male
acquaintance. Joe's missing acumen makes him an easy target for
materialistic con artists, who try to separate Joe from a precious
secret formula book which he keeps in his office safe. Will Joe be
spared? 
Opinion: 
Chicago playwright and writer David Mamet won a Pulitzer Prize for
GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS (1984). He is known for distinctive themes which
permeate most of his work: the theme that society is hypocritical and
superficial; people are insecure and confused, and; people hide behind
rituals and meaningless dialogue to mask their insecurities. Mamet uses
live theater to express this view. The easiest way to recognize a Mamet
work is to examine the dialogue, sometimes described as absurdist. Here
are some examples from THE SPANISH PRISONER: 
Joe: "Funny old world." 
Joe's secretary: "Funny old world? Dog my cats." 
I am just as confused as you are, by "dog my cats." That's the style. In
THE SPANISH PRISONER Mamet takes a mediocre con game yarn, removes most
of the information to make the plot seem more mysterious than it is, and
then replaces real life dialogue with trademark Mamet-style dialogue - -
line where characters interrupt each other with meaningless, nonspecific
mantras right before anyone is about to reveal useful information.  
>From the beginning we can easily see the victim, the prize, the bad
guys, and the fact that Joe is being scammed. And we expect the dialogue
to fill us in on what's happening. But Mamet surprises us. Instead of
regular speech the supposedly ordinary characters spout cryptic
witticisms evocative of a wistful David Niven and a shot of cognac.
Typically, instead of yelling "get me to a hospital" an injured
colleague says, "I put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains." 
In my opinion, this kind of dialogue is done on purpose, because,
Mamet-type main characters usually are written as inwardly insecure. The
cryptic dialogue symbolically represents the fact that people don't
really listen to each other; they merely parrot bland generalities and
false wittiness to mask their inadequacy and unhappiness. Thus
conversation is largely superficial 'dog my cats' stuff, mixed in with
some philosophical barbs and ritualistic tongue-in-cheek toe-the-line
generalizations.
Meanwhile we in the audience don't really know anything about main
character Joe's character at all because his actions are deliberately
inconsistent. Joe cannot decide between a man and a woman. He cannot
decide whether to be ambitious about his job or whether to sit back. He
can't decide whether he wants money or doesn't want it. In fact, the
only solid constants are that Joe's society is corrupt and that Joe is
clueless about the obvious con taking place. This cluelessness continues
about an hour - - the length of time it takes for Joe to perceive what
the audience knows in the first five minutes. Then THE SPANISH PRISONER
quickens a bit, and finally the movie tosses in a good ending - - except
for a flippant explanation of the mastermind.
In a lot of movies one thing which makes a movie amusing or entertaining
for the audience is watching the cat and mouse game between the
antagonist and the protagonist. Usually it's a battle of power, wits,
luck, and strategy between evenly matched contestants or mismatched
contestants where one opponent has grossly underestimated the other. THE
SPANISH PRISONER has no such battle: Joe is completely outclassed by the
cons who have not underestimated him at all. 
A different director such as Alfred Hitchcock would have given Joe some
valiant suspicions and a few sharp and exciting attempts at
investigation or battling back. But here Mamet's cinematic assertion is
that characters - -  however confidently disguised and no matter from
what strata of society - -  are for the most part confused. 
As a medium for delivering dark social criticism, THE SPANISH PRISONER
succeeds artfully. 

Title
Review for Mighty Joe Young (1998)
Written by Lawrence M. Konner and Mark Rosenthal
Synopsis:
An orphaned girl named Jill Young (Charlize Theron) has befriended an
orphaned baby gorilla named Joe who carries within his genes the DNA for
gigantism. Joe's parents were killed by poachers. Years later, Jill is a
young woman living in Africa, and her animal friend Joe is 4.6 meters
tall and weighs 905 kilograms, a magnificent, gentle, and intelligent
giant. For Joe's safety, Jill and her friend Gregg (Bill Paxton)
establish a place for Joe in the United States at a game reserve called
the California Animal Conservancy.
But the evil Mr. Strasser (Rade Serbedzija) and his men, the diabolical
poachers who killed Joe's parents, plot to deceive Jill and take Joe
from the Conservancy in order to sell him on the environmental black
market. When Joe escapes into the Hollywood area, the poor beast is
hunted by gung ho police snipers, evil poachers, and the good guys as
well. Who will reach him first?
Opinion:
As far as I know, there are two main big gorilla flicks: MIGHTY JOE
YOUNG of 1949, and the well known 1933 KING KONG. MIGHTY JOE YOUNG
(1998) is a modernized remake of the 1949 classic.
MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (1998) is a family movie made especially for children,
and it succeeds very well. The good guys are good (young, friendly, with
light colored clothing); the bad guys are bad (dark hat, suspicious
accent, black gloves to hide identifiable hand), and; the beloved animal
is a misunderstood friend who has run away from home. My neighbor took
with her with a troop of four young kids, and they never failed to clap
and cheer when the good guys got one over on the bad guys. The kids also
held their breath when it looked like big Joe might be hurt. It's
obvious that cast members Charlize Theron and Bill Paxton love animals
or have pets of their own. Both Theron and Paxton do such a terrific
acting job that you forget Joe is only a special effect and not an
animal actor.
The adult theme of MIGHTY JOE YOUNG concerns the protection of the
endangered Gorilla, thought to be a mythical creature until proven to be
real by a skin and skull in 1849. Although fairly intelligent and
man-like (Koko the sign language gorilla was tested to have an IQ over
80), the animal has been hunted to near extinction. Today there are less
than 400 remaining wild mountain gorillas. As for the possibility of
gigantism, modern gorillas can weigh 300 to 400 pounds (136 to 181 kg).
The largest ape, "Gigantopethecus," lived in Asia during the Pleistocene
Era. From its bones it is estimated to have been approximately 10 feet
tall and have weighed over 600 pounds (271 kg). It is almost certainly
extinct, but some suggest Gigantopethecus is responsible for tales of
the Yeti and Bigfoot.

Title
Review for Bloodfist VI: Ground Zero (1994)
Ingredients: Cold War missile silo, terrorists, unsuspecting postman who
must take out the bad guys
Stars:
Downplayed by the media during his kickboxer days Japanese-American Don
"the Dragon" Wilson is arguably kickboxing's greatest champ. Wilson was
world champ for 12 consecutive years. He held ten world titles, and
vanquished 15 national champions and 11 world champions (he even
traveled to Thailand, and defeated the Thai champ to become that
country's number one Thai boxer).  Surprisingly, "the Dragon" had no
martial arts experience prior to high school graduation; he was an honor
student with engineering aspirations.
Wilson's primary style is Pai Lum (Dragon Style kung fu), mainly a
kicking art but he has cross-trained extensively. He rarely blocks, and
will take an opponent's kick on his elbow, then use his right roundhouse
leg as a jabbing weapon to methodically open his opponent's defenses for
body punches and well-timed kicks. On film Wilson is proficient in all
kicks and excels in the spinning crescent. His wariness and instinctive
follow through after strikes imparts convincing realism to his fight
scenes.
Cat Sassoon: Catya ("Cat") Sassoon is the daughter famous hair stylist
Vidal Sassoon and actress Beverly Adams. According to a May 28, 1997
interview article with Ellen Fitz-Patrick of FAIR LADY (an
English-language woman's magazine in South Africa) Ms. Sassoon learned
tae kwon do for self defense after a brutal assault at age 14 left her
hospitalized. 
Synopsis:
In this B-grade movie version of the "Diehard" formula (hapless
adventurer wanders into a space that has been taken over by scheming
terrorists) Don "the Dragon" Wilson is Nick Corrigan, a gentle Air Force
courier carrying mail for the shift workers at a nuclear weapons launch
site in Ellsworth. As Corrigan's jeep rolls down the desert highway, a
radio dispatcher barks, "Chop chop, Corrigan. Don't get lost on us
again, you idiot." But as luck would have it, the hapless Corrigan stops
to help an injured roadside animal and arrives 1.5 hours late. This is
fortunate, since his presence is not anticipated by fanatical terrorists
who have hijacked the missile site.  When the site defenses are
activated, Corrigan becomes trapped inside and is the only survivor in a
position to stop the terrorists. Fortunately humble Corrigan knows
martial arts. Cat Sassoon plays one of the bad guys.
Opinion: 
Executive Producer Roger Corman (who is referred to by fans as "King of
the B Movies") produced this movie, so I knew enough to expect B grade
acting and perhaps a low budget. Luckily acting wasn't important in this
movie, as it concentrated mostly on action: gun battles, and hand to
hand combat in accordance with a good and exciting story line.  The
fight choreography under Art Camacho was okay; although combatants
hesitated a few hundredths of a second between strikes rather than
throwing consecutive combinations, it wasn't that noticeable. If you are
an action fan, and you have a Saturday afternoon to kill, this video is
fun, and will do nicely.

Title
Review for Instinct (1999)
Written by: Gerald Di Pego, based on the novel "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn
Starring: Cuba Gooding Jr., Anthony Hopkins, Donald Sutherland, Maura Tierney
Synopsis: 
Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a young psychiatrist who has been given
an interesting case to study: An anthropologist named Ethan Powell (Anthony
Hopkins) who has lost his humanity living in the Rwandan wilderness among
mountain gorillas has been caught, deported, and sent to an American prison
psychiatric ward after killing two rangers. Caulder makes regular therapy
visits to converse with Powell and to try to figure out his mentality. Is
Powell a brutal killer, an ape man, or a downtrodden naturalist with a
legitimate complaint against society? 
Opinion:
INSTINCT plays like a mystery. Mountain gorillas are gentle herbivores who
only attack in self defense, so what could possibly cause an eminent
scientist with the mentality and friendship of herbivores to go out and
attack rangers? Psychiatrist Theo Caulder takes the whole movie to find out
the reason when the answer is obvious. 
INSTINCT isn't very convincing. As Powell Anthony Hopkins seems too
educated and studious to have ape-like episodes of superhuman strength and
brutish behavior. It makes the character seem more like a split personality
than a scientist with a secret reason. That a keen mind such as Powell's
would relish an alternate identity as a primitive, grass-eating forest
creature instead of using his wits and tool-making abilities in the jungle
is barely credible. Similarly unconvincing is the bond between Theo Caulder
and Ethan Powell. Their psychiatric relationship is a clinical,
teacher/student thing. But as Caulder Cuba Gooding Jr. seems overly
emotional, as if the two protagonists had shared more happy moments than
they actually had.
The film's major theme is the innocence of nature versus the corruption of
humanity. This is a noble goal, but INSTINCT hits you over the head with
it. As Powell Anthony Hopkins even draws a colored map of ancient Earth and
diagrams man's historic exploitation of nature. Much more compelling is the
side plot involving Maura Tierney as Powell's neglected daughter, trying to
understand why her father had abandoned the family. To me, a more
intriguing INSTINCT would be a complex movie about a daughter trying to
rediscover the lost father she never knew.

Title
Review for Parent Trap, The (1998)
Written by:
David Swift, Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer. THE PARENT TRAP is a remake
of David Swift's 1961 screenplay which was based on Erich Kastner's 1950
children's book "Das Doppelte Lottchen." 
Starring: 
Lindsay Lohan, Dennis Quaid, Natasha Richardson, Elaine Hendrix, Lisa
Ann Walter, Simon Kunz.
Synopsis: 
THE PARENT TRAP is a Disney remake of the 1961 Disney movie of the same
name. In the 1998 version , Lindsay Lohan plays two twins named Annie
and Hallie who were separated shortly after birth, and raised by each
single parent, respectively. For example, Annie was raised by her
mother, a Londoner, so she has never met her American father. Meanwhile
Hallie was raised by her American father, so she has never met her
British mother. 
By coincidence the twins meet each other at a summer camp, and after a
prank-filled rivalry, Annie and Hallie come to realize that they are
actually sisters. Filled with curiosity about the parents they never
met, they decide to switch places, one going to London while the other
to California. Soon afterwards, they hatch plots to reunite their
divorced parents and live as one happy family.
Opinion:
THE PARENT TRAP is one of those lighthearted, highly entertaining
family-values comedies that people of any age can enjoy. It has
slapstick pranks, family reunions, romance, and an exciting fencing
match. And to top it off, the heroes are kids and the parents are the
same age (instead of the typical 90s movie pairing of ancient sugar
daddy with hot-bodied young gal). 
The talented Lindsay Lohan is effective and charming playing two
different eleven-year-old girls: Annie and Hallie. Lohan does so well at
it that she easily persuades us she is two different people, who,
through eerily coincidental characteristics, come to realize they are
twins, although they've been raised oceans apart. Come to think of it,
every character in THE PARENT TRAP - - from Dennis Quaid and Natasha
Richardson as the parents to hired servants Lisa Ann Walter and Simon
Kunz - - manages to be warmly funny and appealing without stealing the
show or going over the top. 
We're all used to disappointing Hollywood remakes, but thankfully, THE
PARENT TRAP is quite refreshing and fun. Everyone does such a top notch
and balanced job in THE PARENT TRAP that the 1998 version is just as
good or better than the original.

Title
Review for Devil's Advocate, The (1997)
Starring: Keanu Reeves, Al Pacino, Charlize Theron
Ingredients: 
Satan, yuppie lawyer and wife, moral decisions, hallucinations
Synopsis:
Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves ) is an upcoming ambitious yuppie lawyer with
a beautiful wife and a religious mother. When small town guy Lomax gets
hand picked to join a prestigious New York law firm, he brings his
family to New York. But he doesnt realize its part of an even larger
picture concerning God, the Devil, and the world. The film Devils
Advocate is a cross between a back-in-time-loop flick and a morality
play. Lomax, a man of average morality and resistance to temptation,
eventually discovers he is not who he thinks he is; he is actually part
of a divine comedy where the price of making an immoral decision is the
end of the world.
Opinion:
This is one of those films that seemed long and not particularly
exciting when I watched it. Typically, we get to watch Mary Ann Lomax
(Charlize Theron) spend many minutes selecting wallpaper, followed by a
partial face morph of one of her neighbors into a demon and back to
normal again, followed by another long period of selecting wallpaper and
so on and so forth - - which makes the movie seem unexciting.
I felt better a few days after the movie was over and I had time to
think about the story, and the infinite time loop Lomax is stuck in, and
how - - if he ever makes a mistake - - it means the end of the world. 
This film boasts a talented cast and interesting cinematography. For
example, in terms of cinematography, the standard fades and wipes
between scenes are replaced in Devils Advocate by scenic time lapse
photography of clouds and lightning or by pans of medieval ceiling
paintings. Pacinos monologues as Satan can be mesmerizing, and Charlize
Theron displays great acting range in portraying a wife slowly losing
her sanity.
Trivia:
In the story, Lomaxs boss goes by the name of John Milton. This is a
play on words and an insight into what Devils Advocate is supposed to
be about. In real life John Milton was the moralistic 17th century
English author (1608-1674) who wrote the classic poem Paradise Lost
(published first in 1667). Milton believed he had been called upon to
serve as a poet/priest of Gods will. Typical of Miltons main works
('Paradise Lost,' Samson Agonistes,' 'Paradise Regained') is the
underlying theme of a messianic hero in a fallen world who is eventually
led to a clearer understanding of his own divine role.

Title
Review for Star Kid (1997)
Starring: Joseph Mazzello, Arthur Burghard, Alex Daniels
Ingredients: 
Preteen boy who is underconfident, talking armored cybersuit from outer
space, evil space monster
Synopsis: 
Spence (Joseph Mazzello) is a young kid who doesn't have much
confidence. He is too shy to talk to the girl he has a crush on. He lets
a school bully harrass him. He is afraid of spiders. His dad doesn't pay
enough attention to him. His sister thinks he's a fungus.
One day Spence befriends a talking armored cybersuit named Cy that
aliens from outer space have stashed on earth for safekeeping. Wearing
the cybersuit gives Spence super powers. At first Spence use the suit to
scare the bully and to spy on the love of his life. But when an evil
space monster called the Brood Warrior kidnaps Cy, Spence must overcome
his many insecurities, rescue Cy, and defeat the Brood Warrior. 
Opinion:
The bad news is that for an adult this film would be totally
predictable, and the fight scene at the end would be ten minutes too
long. But the good news is that STAR KID represents the fantasy of
almost every young boy from age 5 to age 12, and it is squeaky clean in
terms of lacking bloodshed, swear words, or frightening material. In
other words, parents, if you want to score quick brownie points with
your male youngster, take him to this movie and call it family hour.

Title
Review for Hak hap (1996)
Written by: Tsui Hark, Koan Hui On, Teddy Chan Tak-Sum, Joe Ma Wai-Ho
Starring: Jet Li Lian-Jie, Lau Ching-Wan, Karen Morris (Mok Man-Wai),
Francoise Yip Fong-Wah,
Ingredients: sci fi darkness, remorseless cyborg-type bad guys,
explosions and flying bullets, Terminator like sequence in a hospital,
heartache for a lost love, and a masked guy who wears a costume like
Kato of the Green Hornet with kung fu to match.
In the opening sequence beleaguered members of Commando Squad 701
narrowly escape annihilation by government troups. A narrator explains
that the members of 701 had undergone brain surgery to make them
impervious to pain and emotionally distant. Having lost their humanity,
the robotic superhumans were trained to be the best assassins in the
world but eventually couldn't be controlled, so the government ordered
them eradicated. Survivors escaped and separated to hide among normal
humans. ( An earlier movie depicting the aforementioned supersoldiers
was Universal Soldier [ 1992 ],' starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and
Dolph Lundgren ). 
A couple years later refugee Black Mask ( Jet Li ), superhuman young
former coach of the 701 team, has assumed a lowly new identity in Hong
Kong as gentle librarian Tsui Chik. His only good friend is another
loner: his chess partner, the hardened straight arrow Police Inspector
Shek ( Lau Ching-Wan ).
When Hong Kong's drug czars are systematically attacked and killed,
Inspector Shek takes the case. Unbeknownst to Shek, the remaining
superhumans of Squad 701 - - including a beautiful former lover of Black
Mask's ( Francoise Yip ) -- have banded together under psycho Commander
Shung to become a criminal gang seeking to take over the Asian drug
trade.
Tsui Chik becomes Black Mask again to protect Shek, and soon the police
and Black Mask find themselves battling attacks by the superhumans.
Smaller battles lead to a final conflict at the criminals' stronghold. 
Some comic relief breaks up the action in the antics of Karen Morris
(Mok Man-Wai) as a lovestruck pampered love interest from the library
who chases both Tsui Chik and Black Mask, not knowing they're the same
man.
Stars:
Beijing born Jet Li was a member of China's national wushu demonstration
team in his early teens and was invited to perform for President Richard
Nixon ( Nixon shocked the world by opening US relations with communist
China ).  Wushu, means martial arts' but since 1958,  it has come to
mean a national ( non-combative ) performance art that combines old
fight forms with gymnastics, Peking Opera, acrobatics, choreography,
dramatic interpretation and sometimes even music.  In movies, the style
involves fast thrusts, grabs, counterthrusts, and acrobatic leaps to
avoid being thrown.  
A prodigy, Li won the Chinese national wushu championships five years in
a row. After a few unnoticed minor film roles, Li hit it big in the
Asian scene with the movie Once Upon a Time in China ( 1991 ),'
directed and produced by Tsui Hark (  the director of Double Team, with
Van Damme and Dennis Rodman  ). Among his fans' favorite movies are
Fist of Legend  ( 1994 )' a remake of a Bruce Lee classic. 
In Black Mask actor Jet Li is reunited with 'Once Upon a Time in China'
director Tsui Hark and Fist of Legend' fight choreographer Yuen
Woo-Ping.
Jackie Chan fans may recognize Black Mask's lost former lover Yueh-lan
from Squad 701 as actress Francoise Yip, who played Jackie Chan's love
interest Nancy, the motorcycle girl from Rumble in the Bronx ( 1995 ).' 
Opinion:
Like The Terminator,' this is a neat action movie that goes for mood,
action, and style more than anything. It feels like an artsy sci fi
piece -- a comic book turned real --  with its mod music and dark
costumes, architectural structures, and action camera angles. The fight
scenes are a mixture of fast hand to hand combat with shootings,
explosions, darkness and flying glass all around -- and are
well-choreographed by veteran action director Yuen Woo-Ping.
Dramatically Jet Li gets solid acting support from Lau Ching Wan, doing
his best to flesh out the character of Tsui Chik's gruff cop buddy Shek. 
The exciting final confrontation between Commander Shung and Black Mask
involves using electrical cables as flailing weapons. The character of
Commander Shung isn't explored much, so in my opinion, the most
climactic scene isn't the final confrontation but rather when Black Mask
reluctantly battles his former lover Yueh-lan, the super soldier woman
of his flashbacks. 

Title
Review for Payback (1999)
Written by: Terry Hayes and Brian Helgeland, adapted from a Richard
Stark novel
Synopsis:
This is not a thriller so much as an action comedy. PAYBACK opens with a
few narrated words from Porter (Mel Gibson), a smalltime con man and
thief who seems to have all the bad luck in the world. In his loveless
marriage his wife is a drug addicted loser; he has been defeated,
betrayed, and robbed of $70,000, and; the woman he really loves (Maria
Bello) is owned by the mob.
Understandably, Porter becomes slightly obsessed with getting his money
back, and undertakes diabolical and risky adventures to retrieve his
$70,000 from the syndicate. Can a smalltime fish like Porter save
himself and his sweetie from a life of bad luck and crime?
Opinion:
LETHAL WEAPON megastar Mel Gibson is a well known real-life practical
joker as well as an actor with excellent comic timing. In PAYBACK his
talents basically carry the show. It's Mel versus the mob, upping the
ante and explosion level with each seesawing encounter, until Mel
finally gets the last gloat.
Remember the old Roadrunner, Woody Woodpecker or Spy versus Spy
cartoons, where over-the-top cartoon violence is played for laughs? It's
the same principle in PAYBACK, only Woody Woodpecker's laughing victory
gloat is repackaged as the mantra "Hubba hubba hubba."
A few times the escapist humor gets a little overdone and may even seem
bizarre. For example, there are scenes where Lucy Liu plays a beautiful
Asian woman who gets lip-smacking erotic thrills from being punched in
the face (which somehow doesn't inspire too many belly laughs).
Taken as a whole, PAYBACK still manages to package all of the right
buttons for action fans. It's got fisticuffs galore, explosions, action,
trickery, a dame in distress, and a brave, goofy hero outsmarting the
baddies. What more could action fans ask for?

Title
Review for Replacement Killers, The (1998)
Starring: Chow Yun-Fat, Mira Sorvino, Michael Rooker
Synopsis: 
The title of this gangster redemption movie THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS
might be a reference to THE KILLER, a famous Asian movie about gangster
redemption, starring Chow Yun-Fat. The story is simple:
Hitman John Lee (Chow Yun-Fat), does the honorable thing and refuses his
assignment to terminate a seven-year-old boy. This angers his powerful
mobster boss, and the incensed crime lord hires a swarm of goons
('replacement killers') to kill off John and the kid. At first John's
main concern is to reach China to put his mother and sister out of reach
of the crime lord's vengeance. So he meets up with a forger named Meg
(Mira Sorvino)in order to get a passport. But apparently it's open
season on John and Meg. They're in over their heads and chased around
town by loads of gunslinging goon squads. The rest of the movie is all
high octane 'run and gun.' When the bullets stop flying after the final
confrontation, the movie basically ends.
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is co-produced by John Woo, [Director of
FACE/OFF]. The cinematography is super and so are the shootouts. 
Opinion:
With THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS, we're talking about a much beloved plot
formula. Picture a 1950s black and white Japanese samurai movie. Outlaw
samurai blows into town and tries to act honorably. But an even nastier
dishonorable samurai with more men is out to kill innocent townsfolk.
The outlaw hero ends up using his formidable swordsmanship skills to
dispatch blade-wielding goons until the final battle ends. Then he walks
off into the sunset.
Fast forward to the 1970s. Take the same movie, and make everyone wear a
cowboy hat, boots, and a pancho. Outlaw gunfighter (picture Cline
Eastwood) blows into town and tries to act honorably. But a nastier
outlaw gunfighter with more men is out to kill innocent townsfolk. The
outlaw gunfighter ends up using his formidable shooting skills to cap
gun-wielding goons until the final battle ends. Then he rides a horse
off into the sunset.
Now it's 1998. Add cool music, artsy cinematography, more shootouts, and
a hot-looking blonde sidekick. The outlaw gunfighter who blows into town
is an oriental gangster who tries to act honorably. But a mafia-type
mobster with loads of men is out to kill an innocent boy. The oriental
assassin ends up using his formidable shooting skills to dispatch
gun-wielding goons until the final battle ends. Then he rides a plane
off into the sunset.
THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS is quite thin on suspense and plot, but the
cinematography is excellent and so are the gun battles. Mira Sorvino
does a credible job as Meg, and Chow Yun-Fat may not become as famous as
Clint Eastwood after this flick, but after THE REPLACEMENT KILLERS his
name is sure to become a second tier household word in America. 
Stars:
1.  Chow Yun-Fat
Put simply, Chow Yun-Fat is Asia's top actor - - he's kind of like an
Asian Robert Mitchum; Chow Yun-Fat's a a guy that Asian ladies think is
hunky because he's humble and has a manly charisma at the same time. Fat
was born a poor farm boy on an island near Hong Kong. He began laboring
at age 5 doing farm chores, and selling dim sum in the Hong Kong alleys
and streets with his mother. He never completed a formal education, but
a lucky break occured during school. A TV network sent two applications
for auditions, and when Fat tried out, they gave him a chance as an
actor. The rest, as they say, is history.
Fat - - who hates to be called Mr. Chow and prefers to be called 'Fat'
or his nickname 'Fatboy' - -  doesn't know the first thing about kung
fu, but the man can act. He once played an idiot savant like Dustin
Hoffman's RAIN MAN character. And like Susan Lucci, Chow Yun-Fat was a
prime time soap star with years of TV dramas (over 14 years to be exact)
under his belt. Like Richard Gere, Chow Yun-Fat did cheesy gigolo flicks
in the 1970s. And like James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart, Chow excels
portraying the cool, toothpick-chewing, chain-smoking - - but somehow
noble - - gun-toting gangster. A versatile actor, Fat has also played a
bumbling country oaf. 
Though he has worked primarily in Hong Kong, now Chow Yun-Fat is in
Hollywood and has the attention of big name directors like Oliver Stone,
Quentin Tarantino, and John Woo. It took a year and half of English
lessons for him to learn enough English to star in THE REPLACEMENT
KILLERS. The burning question for money-minded moguls of Hollywood is:
Chow Yun-Fat is a great success in Asia, but will an Eastern hero
concept - - an understated blend of humility and charisma in a nonwhite
man - - be marketable to an American audience accustomed to Brad Pitt,
Ethan Hawke, Leonardo DiCaprio, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, and Mel
Gibson?
2. Mira Sorvino 
Mira is a Harvard cum laude graduate. She once spent eight months living
in Beijing, and was a Chinese studies major in college.  She won an
Oscar in 1995 for playing a porn actress in the film MIGHTY APHRODITE. 

Title
Review for U.S. Marshals (1998)
Ingredients:
Fugitive federal agent, ace U.S. Marshal and his competent team, plot to
sell government secrets
Starring: 
Tommy Lee Jones, Wesley Snipes, Irene Jacob, Robert Downey Jr.
Synopsis: 
In this sequel to THE FUGITIVE the great U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy
Lee Jones) meets his match when he and his team of deputies are assigned
to catch a dangerous fugitive federal agent named Mark Sheridan (Wesley
Snipes), who is suspected of killing two federal agents and selling
American government secrets.
Marshal Gerard immediately gets suspicious when he notices that, for a
ruthless killer on the lam, how come Sheridan keeps going out of his way
not to hurt anybody? And why have the Feds assigned a suspicious federal
agent (Robert Downey Jr.) to keep tabs on Gerard's team and trail the
marshals wherever they go? 
Will Gerard catch Sheridan? Will Sheridan be able to evade the cops?
Will everyone finally figure out what's really going on?
Opinion:
This is a passable chase movie, following the formula of THE FUGITIVE.
There's a great plane crash in the beginning (it was an overturned bus
in THE FUGITIVE), and a spectacular scene where Sheridan is chased by
the Marshals to the top of a tall nursing home (it was the top of a tall
dam in THE FUGITIVE) and must make a breathtaking escape. Gerard and
Sheridan have a good fist fight as well.
The dialogue is sharp, and even side characters such as the airplane
pilot are well acted. The chases are exciting, and the special effects
are good. I especially loved Sheridan's daring escape from the top of
the nursing home.
There are some glitches in the story. For example Sheridan's girlfriend
Marie (Irene Jacobs) goes to a locker at Chicago's O'Hare  Airport,
removes a dark, important-looking bag and sneaks it to Sheridan, but the
bag's mysterious contents are never revealed. Another time, a captured
crook implies that someone higher up is behind the selling of government
secrets, but he refuses to reveal who the mastermind is. And we still
aren't sure if the real mastermind is caught by the movie's end.
Finally, U.S. MARSHALS would have a sharper dramatic edge to it if - -
as in THE FUGITIVE - - the plot allowed us to know right away that some
grave injustice were about to be done.
These nagging details take away from an otherwise entertaining movie,
but you know what they say about sequels.

Title
Review for Great Expectations (1998)
Written by: Mitch Glazer, from the Charles Dickens classic GREAT
EXPECTATIONS
Starring: 
Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Hank Azaria, Anne Bancroft, Robert De Niro
Ingredients: 
Starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood
Synopsis: 
GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1998) is a modernized version of a Charles Dickens
novel. In the original Charles Dickens classic an orphan boy named Pip
learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict, his
relationship with a bitter old lady named Miss Havisham, and his
hopeless lifetime infatuation with Havisham's snobbish adopted daughter,
Estella. The gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends Pip
to London for Pip to become an upper class "gentleman." Pip leaves for
London with "great expectations" to be groomed into a gentleman so that
he can one day be classy enough to marry Estella. But life has a way of
complicating things. Pip becomes an arrogant S.O.B. until he learns just
who his secret benefactor is.
In this new 1998 version of GREAT EXPECTATIONS a poor Florida lad named
Finn (Ethan Hawke) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of
helping an escaped convict (Robert De Niro). But soon the focus of
Finn's life becomes romance, as he develops a lifelong infatuation with
Estella (Gwyneth Paltrow), an upper crust girl with some psychological
and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment.
Estella was raised in wealth by Ms. Dinsmoor (Anne Bancroft), an
eccentric, aged and embittered, man-hating single aunt whose groom left
her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage. This causes
Estella to 'fear the daylight' of relationships, but Finn thinks it's
just a case of snobbery.
When Finn becomes a young man, an anonymous benefactor sets Finn up in
New York with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous
artist. Finn leaves Florida with "great expectations" to be a successful
artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the
snobbish Estella. What will happen to all of Finn's "great
expectations?"
Ethan Hawke is romantic lead. (He romanced Winona Ryder in REALITY
BITES. He romanced Julie Delpy in BEFORE SUNRISE. He romanced Uma
Thurman in GATTACA. Now in GREAT EXPECTATIONS he gets to chase Gwyneth
Paltrow, a rail-thin blonde.) Hawke plays a lovestruck, earnest and
unchanged Finn throughout the film. 
Meanwhile Paltrow portrays Estella as alternating between infuriating
tease and ice princess; Estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in
love and then hurt them rather than become intimate. Anne Bancroft goes
a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic Ms. Dinsmoor, while
Robert De Niro carries off the convict part suitably. 
The difference between the classic Dickens novel and this 1998
adaptation is that the Dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless
themes about class struggle and love, whereas GREAT EXPECTATIONS (1998)
is more artsy, less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with
a lifetime tease. 

Title
Review for Lola rennt (1998)
Starring: Franka Potente, Moritz Bleibtreu and Herbert Knaup
Synopsis: 
In a phone call Lola (Franka Potente) learns that her boyfriend Manni
(Moritz Bleibtreu) will be killed by a drug dealer unless she and Manni
cough up 100,000 deutschemarks in the next 20 minutes. This sends Lola on a
frantic dash for cash to the accompaniment of mod music and scenes of a lot
of running (hence the title RUN LOLA RUN). 
Opinion:
Remember the film GROUNDHOG DAY where Bill Murray played Phil, the
sarcastic weatherman who got to redo the day several times until he finally
performed the day the magical way it was fated to happen? Same deal here,
only instead of Phil the sarcastic weatherman we get the MTV treatment. We
cheer for Lola the cute, hyperkinetic, screaming punker girl with army
boots, tatoos, and color-dyed hair as she high tails it to Daddy's bank.
Lola's got 20 minutes to succeed, the stakes are deadly, and she doesn't
get as many chances as Phil did. It makes for a fun and quirky collage as
small details happen right and left which change fate like shards in a
kaleidoscope.

Title
Review for Great Wall Is a Great Wall, The (1986)
Written by: Peter Wang and Shirley Sun
Starring: Peter Wang, Sharon Iwai, Kelvin Han Yee, Li Qinqin, Hy
Xiaoguang, Shen Guanglan
Synopsis: 
In this cultural exploration, a Chinese American computer engineer named
Fang (Peter Wang) decides to take a month-long vacation to visit his
sister Mrs. Chao (Shen Guanglan), her husband Mr. Chao (Hy Xiaoguang),
and their teenage daughter Lili (Li Qinqin) in Beijing after 30 years of
separation. Fang brings his Asian American wife Grace (Sharon Iwai) and
his college-aged son Paul (Kelvin Han Yee) along, both of whom don't
speak Chinese. The encounter between the two families allows the
audience to compare the Eastern and Western cultures as well as the
ambitions of individual characters. 
Opinion:
Sometimes a film is plot driven. Sometimes it's a character sketch. A
GREAT WALL (1986) can be called a culture sketch, as opposed to a
character sketch because it gently compares a Chinese American family to
a Beijing family.  
Fang's family is thoroughly Americanized. Fang is an upper middle class
professional who enjoys jogging and argues with his boss. His wife can't
cook Chinese. His son has a white girlfriend and complains of racism
when Fang encourages him to befriend an Asian girl. Meanwhile Fang's
Beijing sister advocates absolute loyalty to the 'work unit.' Her
husband is a retired official who has heard rumors of American depravity
(homosexuals running the streets), and her daughter Lili longs for
American freedoms in a youth culture where studying for college entrance
exams is the most important thing in life. The two families spend a
month slowly learning about each other.
There is no ultimate 'answer' or final comprehensive understanding after
the month-long vacation. The film is neither here nor there; it's a
neutral, meandering, gentle, portrait of life on both sides.

Title
Review for Apostle, The (1997)
Starring: Robert Duvall, Farrah Fawcett, John Beasley, Miranda
Richardson
Ingredients: Down-on-his-luck evangelist, church
Synopsis:
Sonny Dewey (Robert Duvall) is a tireless Texas Pentecostal preacher who
unexpectedly catches his wife (Farrah Fawcett) in bed with another guy.
In a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's
head, and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder, and estranged
from his wife and two kids. To atone for his sins, Sonny flees to a
rural bayou town in Louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - -
the Apostle E.F. As the Apostle E.F. Sonny's main mission is to revive
an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio
station. Soon he sets about resurrecting the One Way Road to Heaven
Holiness Temple. But Sonny knows his time is short; one day the police
will find him.
Opinion: 
This movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life
terms. I believe that Robert Duvall (who is the producer, director,
writer, and main star of THE APOSTLE) deserves an Oscar for his
performance as Sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is
so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting
performances on film. Duvall's portrayal of a true believer is
authentic, superb, and inspired; it offers the audience a completely
honest look at Southern religion, as well as a portrait of a fallible,
complicated man driven by his beliefs. 
Incidentally, in real life Duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the
project underway. Since no major Hollywood studio wanted to risk
financing a complex movie about an evangelist, THE APOSTLE as a project
lay dormant for almost 13 years before Duvall was able to get it done,
paying for its production with his own money (about five million
dollars).
In terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal THE APOSTLE
would rank as one of the best movies of this decade, and I emphatically
recommend THE APOSTLE for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film.
Similarly, those with a steep background in Pentecostal Christianity
would find THE APOSTLE a thought-provoking experience.
On the other hand, THE APOSTLE's main strength - - Duvall's preaching -
- is also what limits THE APOSTLE's target audience. In terms of plot
and pure entertainment value, THE APOSTLE is definitely not for
everyone. Teenagers, action fans, comedy fans, and people who find
church completely boring should stay far away from this movie, since
three quarters of the film is watching Sonny preach at church. In other
words, THE APOSTLE is a four star performance, but with a very limited
audience.

Title
Review for Madeline (1998)
Directed by: Daisy von Scherler Mayer
Written by: Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett, from the book by Ludwig
Bemelmans. 
Starring: Hatty Jones and Frances McDormand
Ingredients: 
Paris boarding school for 12 young girls, adventures of little girl
Synopsis:
MADELINE begins with the opening of a storybook, and it should,
considering that it's a storybook movie for children. MADELINE doesn't
follow the normal stereotypical formats for action movies, comedies, et
cetera. Instead, MADELINE kind of wanders around, allowing the audience
to hear the tale, and experience spunky little Madeline's various
adventures, including discovering a kidnapping plot by goofy circus
clowns, and saving her boarding school.
Madeline (Hatty Jones) is an little British orphan girl who lives with
twelve other young girls in a charitable boarding school in Paris. The
school is run by the intuitive nun, Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand), who
can often smell when "something is not right." In this case, something
is often not right, since Madeline is always getting into one form of
mischief or another.
Madeline's adventures include having an operation at the hospital,
falling into a river, looking for a lost dog, befriending a neighborhood
boy, trying to figure out why the boarding school's owner Lord Covington
wants to close down the school, and foiling a kidnapping attempt on the
Spanish ambassador's son. 
Opinion: 
Summer movies always seem to be geared towards adolescent males (or as
my girlfriend would say, the adolescent in all males). Main characters?
Male cop, male detective, male kid, male oil driller, male doctor, male
cowboy, male secret agent, male pig, male scientist, male plastic toy,
male dog. And the hero always has to save things on a really grand
scale. He fights off 100 thugs single-handedly, saves the town, saves
the free world, saves his city, saves America, saves his female partner
and the Earth, et cetera et cetera. Movies for adults demand that heroes
do fantasy on a big scale.
On the other hand, elementary school-aged kids have a different
mentality. To a kid, spending a night in the hospital getting your
tonsils taken out is suspenseful. Looking for your lost dog is dramatic.
Saving a baby bird is simply monumental. Adults swallow movies with
formula plots. But to a kid, walking around meeting new friends and
escaping trouble suffices for plot. As a result, kid movies are way
different from adult movies. 
The problem is, these days hardly anyone knows how to make kid movies.
Typical of most attempts are kiddie-aged heroes who are supposed to
speak like real kids, but end up sounding like hipper-than-thou
thirty-something script writers. And it's especially rare to find a
movie where the protagonist is a spunky elementary school-aged girl who
actually thinks and acts like an elementary school-aged girl. How many
can you think of, off the top of your head?
Rare, indeed. That's what makes MADELINE is somewhat of a gem, despite
arguably anglo-centric overtones (in the movie, Africans and Indians are
exoticized and tricked). MADELINE is done from a small girl's point of
view, and it's done well. It's simply a story about a little girl who
has a few neat little adventures. No emotional baggage, weighty
cynicism,  fancy tricks, world-banging drama, no violence, no sex, no
gore. Just the simple wonder of being young and wondrous and meeting
interesting folks and having occasional excitement. Throw in scenes
involving a loyal doggy, a caring old woman, adventure at the circus,
and an exciting kidnapping, and your kids have themselves a quality
movie.

Title
Review for Meet Joe Black (1998)
Written by: Ron Osborn, Jeff Reno, Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman
Ingredients: The grim reaper, old man, beautiful daughter
Starring: Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani
Synopsis: 
An aging, weakened, but fabulously wealthy senior news tycoon named Bill
(Anthony Hopkins) utters some words to his nubile daughter Susan (Claire
Forlani) about how only the experience of true love makes life worth
living. The Grim Reaper who is death personified (Brad Pitt) overhears
Bill's tribute to true love and becomes intrigued. He visits Bill to cut
a deal. Inhabiting the body of Joe Black, a recently deceased young man,
the Grim Reaper promises to delay Bill's death in exchange for Bill
showing him life. Unaware that Death is inhabiting the body, Susan
remembers her dad's lecture on true love and tries to start up a
relationship with Joe Black.
Opinion:
MEET JOE BLACK is three hours long and feels like it is three hours
long. Some of the parts are done well. For example, the scenes where
Bill contemplates his impending death and begins to pay more attention
to his eldest daughter are sure to bring tears. On the other hand, other
scenes feel odd. For example, Joe Black's height varies throughout the
picture. Another example is when an old man promises a woman he will
meet her for a fireworks display at the bottom of the hill. As she is
waiting for him she suddenly senses something wrong. Sure enough, the
old guy is dying on top of the hillside overlooking the fireworks.
Seeing him stumbling at the top of the hill, the woman runs up the hill
in alarm. But oddly she completely disregards the dying man when her
boyfriend arrives to woo her. 
Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani do a good job acting the
father/daughter bond. And for Brad Pitt fans, MEET JOE BLACK features
Brad in several nice outfits, with his trademark hairstyle.

Title
Review for Big Lebowski, The (1998)
Starring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi
Synopsis: 
This comedy is about a dope-smoking alcoholic beach bum nicknamed 'the
Dude' (Jeff Bridges). The Dude visits millionaire Jeff Lebowski to talk
about a damaged rug, but Mr. Lebowski gets a wild idea and hires the
Dude as a courier. Lebowski's wife Bunny has just been kidnapped, and
Lebowski needs a guy to drop off the ransom. 
Lebowsky gives the Dude a briefcase to drop off, but unfortunately, it
gets stolen. This leads to a situation where various people come to
punch the Dude's lights out: the angry millionaire Lebowski; Lebowski's
eccentric artist daughter Maude and her thugs; a gang of violent German
musicians, and; a pornography mogul gangster whom Bunny owes money to. 
Aiding the Dude in his quest for peace are two bowling buddies: an
unstable Vietnam veteran named Walter (John Goodman), and a nerd Donny
(Steve Buscemi) who is never allowed to speak his opinion. Will the Dude
guess what happened to Bunny and the money?
Opinion:
Unlike FARGO, which was also directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, THE BIG
LEBOWSKI is a comedy. Basically, the plot is long and pointless as it
takes a backstage to laughs. The film is little more than a showcase for
a continual parade of oddities. For example, the Dude is always wasted
and is hung up on nihilism. Walter is always quoting Vietnam and is big
on Judaism. Maude zooms across the ceiling naked wearing a harness. John
Turturro shows up as a convicted pedophile turned bowler. And so on. The
actors really ham it up. Some parts are funny, but overall the movie
tends to drag. 

Title
Review for Lake Placid (1999)
Starring: Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, Betty
White
Synopsis: 
Paleontologist Kelly (Bridget Fonda) goes to Maine to investigate an animal
attack and meets up with Jack (Bill Pullman) from the Fish and Game
Service, Sheriff Keough (Brendan Gleeson) and eccentric mythology
professor, Hector Cyr (Oliver Platt). The heroes discover that a 30-foot
man-eating crocodile is the culprit and decide they must catch it.
Meanwhile old Mrs. Bickerman (Betty White) is rooting for the reptile. 
Opinion:
As reptiles, crocs don't have the metabolism to be insatiably hungry (they
get hungry only once every two weeks). And fatal hippo attacks outnumber
croc attacks in Africa. Like many scary beasts, crocs are an endangered
species, having been terrorized by that scariest animal of all, the modern
human. So LAKE PLACID wasn't meant to be realistic.
Not really a horror flick but a campy satire LAKE PLACID has its humor. I
had heard LAKE PLACID was about a giant alligator (a corruption of the
Spanish word el largato) in Black Lake, so I envisioned a 1950s B-grade
black and white flick where privileged folks with scientific gear and names
like Kay and Mark and Sheriff run around a lagoon trying to capture a
mysterious menace while superstitious locals fearfully look on. 
LAKE PLACID does the same kind of envisioning, if only to poke fun at old
B-movies. The camera introduces a beaver with JAWS-type music. Then Kelly,
Jack, Hector and Sheriff are cast as terribly sardonic and satirical people
who think every one else is a weirdo. They approach the adventure as if it
is a sarcasm contest. And instead of terrified villagers, Betty White shows
up as a snide and foul-mouthed local who is rooting against the authorities
and for the crocodile. Everyone in the movie is sarcastic. It's good for a
chuckle or two.
The movie characters can't fathom why a 30-foot saltwater crocodile would
be living in a cold lake in Maine because salties are warm water animals.
But who knows? Salties in Australia and Indonesia get past 20 feet, live to
a hundred years, and swim across oceans. As evolutionary survivors crocs
have been around as long as the dinosaurs, having endured cataclysms that
killed off the dinosaurs and later cataclysms that killed off large
prehistoric mammals such as woolly mammoths and sabre-toothed tigers. Maybe
Betty White wasn't rooting for the losing side.

Review for Firestorm (1998)
Starring: Howie Long, Scott Glenn, William Forsythe, Suzy Amis
Synopsis: 
>From the ad, I thought this movie was an action movie about a soldier,
but it turns out FIRESTORM is about the adventures of a smokejumper in a
firestorm. Jesse (Howie Long, the former Los Angeles Raiders football
star defensive lineman) is a smokejumper - - a fireman who parachutes
out of helicopters to fight forest fires that are hard to access by
road. A firestorm is a situation where air suddenly comes rushing into a
forest fire, causing a blazing inferno. Unknown to Jesse, some escaped
convicts led by a psycho (William Forsythe) are dressed as firefighters.
They are using a deliberately set blaze as a distraction to make their
escape through the burning forest. A beautiful birdwatcher (Suzy Amis)
becomes their hostage. When fireman Jesse parachutes in alone, he soon
finds that he must defeat the psychos, rescue the girl, and escape the
firestorm all at the same time. This is a B-grade flick, the kind where
fireman Jesse is trapped in a burning camping lodge but manages to
escape because - - unbelievably - -  a motorcycle happens to be parked
inside there, and fortunately a piece of fallen debris looks just like a
convenient ramp. It's just a matter of catapulting out the roof despite
there being no hole. In another scene, a criminal's head is used to plug
a boat leak. The screenplay was written by Chris Soth and Graham Yost
(SPEED) and the film marks the directorial debut of director Dean Semler
(the cinematographer of DANCES WITH WOLVES). 
Opinion:
This is a mediocre firefighting yarn that's half DANTE'S PEAK and half
BACKDRAFT. FIRESTORM is fairly predictable with many cheesy escapes. But
it is watchable, and at least you won't fall asleep. I felt as if I were
watching something like SPEED 2, only with a smaller budget for actors
and effects. 

Title
Review for Big Daddy (1999)
Written by: by Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler
Starring: Adam Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart
Synopsis: 
Sonny Koufax (Adam Sandler) is a rich, childish, angry man who has just
been dumped by his girlfriend Vanessa (Kristy Swanson). In a bid to impress
Vanessa Sonny impersonates his friend Kevin (Jon Stewart) and adopts a 5
year old boy named Julian (Cole and Dylan Sprouse) while Kevin is on an
overseas trip. Under Sonny's supervision Julian soon learns to lie to
women, tell people how he "wipes his ass," throw tantrums, and scream for
his "God damned" treats. Self centered, Julian breaks a school classmate's
arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong.
Meanwhile Sonny bribes Julian with sugary talk, food, toys, and flashy
promises in order to get the kid to perform. Not surprisingly the
government takes Julian away from Sonny's incompetent supervision, and this
leads to a custody battle. 
Opinion:
It's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk,
and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent
kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy
behavior. That's the essence of BIG DADDY. 
But there's a bigger issue involved: marketing. Movies that are rated PG
and PG-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below.
On TV, film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies.
Then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like
Austin Powers with characters named Fat Bastard - - or BIG DADDY where
adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds
and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment. 
Folks in Hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy
stuff, but I think most American parents would agree that early childhood
is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media
market exploitation. To many American mothers there's probably nothing more
pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised
little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father Adam
Sandler jokes about a woman's "ice cold tits."

Review for Zhong Nan Hai bao biao (1994)
Also called Zhong Nan Hai bao biao (1994)
Directed by: Corey Yuen Kwai
Starring: Jet Li, Christy Chung, Kent Cheng, Ngai Sing
In this drama about the purity and ultimate triumph of Asian values, a
beautiful prosecution witness in Hong Kong (Christy Cheung) is looking
for romance and must choose between the eligible Chinese men in her
life. Her options: 1.  The Chinese-American ("I know I broke my promise
to visit you, but take these gifts instead."); 2.  The Hong Kong cops
("Jeez, I let a kid pickpocket me, and now I have a water pistol instead
of a real gun."), or; 3.  A strict  he-man bodyguard (Jet Li) from
mainland China who keeps his mouth shut, his eyes down, and his mind on
the honor of the Beijing Bodyguard Corps. 
In the well-choreographed action subplot, the bad guys go after
Michelle. Bodyguard Hoi (Jet Li) periodically blows away hundreds of bad
guys with his pistol. In the end a flag is raised to Hoi; he did his
duty.
Stars: 
Beijing born Jet Li successfully made the transition from martial arts
to drama. He was a five-time Chinese national champion in wushu, a
dramatic performance art that mixes martial arts forms with Peking
Opera, gymnastics, and acrobatics.
Christy Cheung represented the city of Montreal, Canada in the 1993 TVB
Miss Chinese International Pageant.
Opinion:
I got the impression the actors were somewhat handicapped by the way the
characters were written. Michelle is flighty and vacuous, so
conversation is limited to slamming doors in indignation. Li's character
Hoi is the strong, silent type, so aside from fight scenes he can do
little more than pout and look down. Limitations such as these don't
allow the actors much space for romantic chemistry or communication, so
the film is devoid of dialogue between the two that is any more complex
than the stamping of angry feet. As a result, enjoyment of the movie
boils down to a few bare bones essentials: fan faith, the physical
beauty of Christy Cheung, and Li's fight scenes. 
The film relies heavily on action, and the majority of the action scenes
are well crafted and satisfying. Li's kung fu is fast and furious, as
usual. Rambo fans also get to see Li stand up unscathed and shoot about
50 guys with his pistol in a mall and at home. On the negative side, Li
strikes inexplicable and superfluous fashion poses as he stands on the
stairway firing his gun at bad guys. Other action sequences - - in which
the supposedly ordinary bodyguard is pulled across a counter by
invisible strings, breathes copious amounts of poison gas with no ill
effects, and holds glowing flashlights in the dark without being shot at
in a room full of assassins - - are creatively fun. Ngai Sing turns in a
solid performance as a vengeful villain.
Unfortunately for non-Chinese speakers the subtitles are very roughly
translated and often difficult to read against the film's bright
background. But language is no impediment to predicting the film's
events and outcome.

Review for Star Trek: Insurrection (1998)
Written by: Rich Berman and Michael Piller
Starring: Patrick Stewart, Donna Murphy, Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes,
Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, Marina Sirtis, Gates McFadden, F. Murray
Abraham
Ingredients: Forced displacement of ethnic minorities, idealistic
starship captain
Synopsis: 
An idyllic planet has rings around it that emit mysterious metaphasic
radiation, creating an anti-aging effect similar to that of the fabled
Fountain of Youth. In order to covet this valuable resource for
themselves, the greedy United Federation of Planets and their ally the
mysterious Ru'afo of the Son'a race (F. Murray Abraham) try to forcibly
relocate the planet's inhabitants: 600 peaceful Ba'ku villagers, who
have renounced technology and don't wish to be relocated. 
Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the Federation starship
USS Enterprise decide that forced relocation of minorities is an immoral
violation of the Prime Directive (the law preventing the Federation from
interfering with the development of other societies). They side with the
villagers and lead an insurrection against Ru'afo's forces.
In the subplot, Picard falls in love with Anij, a Ba'ku woman who is
over 300 years old. 
Opinion:
In 1962 racism in America was so rampant that George Wallace won his
governorship supporting the separation of Whites from non-Whites. Only
about three years later came Gene Rodenberry's space adventure series
Star Trek - - a disguised method for 1960s people to examine their own
attitudes towards war, racism and international cooperation.
Roddenberry's Star Trek was not so much about the future as it was about
current issues and moral dilemmas. Advocating a more multicultural
society, it helped shape America.
Like its 1960s predecessor, STAR TREK: INSURRECTION has a strong moral
tint to it: questioning whether the greater good of the majority (the
Federation) outweighs the needs of the minority (the Ba'ku). This
agonizing question, which has plagued humanity for centuries, is decided
in about 5 minutes by the Enterprise crew. Then they have a short,
bloodless war, where a child must predictably run back to look for his
beloved lost pet despite an avalanche of falling rocks. And in the
aftermath, the heroes ride off into the sunset without regard to how
future conflicts over the metaphasic resource might occur or be
prevented; or how their use of technology has affected the villagers
whose culture has vowed to renounce technology; or the politics of
disobeying Federation military orders. 
STAR TREK: INSURRECTION clocks in at about an hour and 43 minutes.
Somewhat escapist, the film leaves the juicy, formidable questions
unanswered. But it is still plenty enjoyable in the way that TV episodes
are: nice, neat, and sanitized. After an intriguing beginning, there is
no shortage of action in the second half to keep Trekkies and
non-Trekkies satisfied.

Title
Review for Doctor Dolittle (1998)
Written by: Nat Mauldin and Larry Levin
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Kyla Pratt, Oliver Platt, the voice of Chris
Rock as a hamster
Ingredients: Physician who talks to animals, dog, hamster, tiger
Synopsis: 
When he was a kid John Dolittle could talk to animals, but as the adult
Doctor John Dolittle, the memory is completely repressed. One day, after
he drives his little daughter off to camp, John suffers a bump on the
head that revives his ability to understand what animals are saying.
When people don't understand Dolittle's strange new behavior, it leads
to a lot of comedic situations - - like getting put in the looney bin,
hiding a circus tiger within his health clinic, giving CPR to a rat, and
being chased by the police. 
Meanwhile, other situations are complicating Dolittle's life. For
example, a big, unethical HMO is trying to buy out his humble health
clinic. And DoLittle's smart little daughter is being cruelly shunned by
kids at camp. 
Can the good doctor straighten out the situations and also cope with the
emergence of his peculiar talent? 
Opinion: 
There's a scene in this movie where Eddie Murphy, as Dr. Dolittle, is in
his car, and he blasts the radio and overspeeds to drown out the sound
of a hamster's voice because he doesn't want to believe that the hamster
is talking to him. The loud car comes peeling into his daughter's camp,
and we all get a big laugh because dear old "Dad" is all of a sudden
acting so nutty. Yet just a few years ago, Murphy seemed typecast to
play wisecracking macho characters (METRO and BEVERLY HILLS COP) who
always blasted the radio and sped down the street. 
When saw that scene in DOCTOR DOLITTLE, I was impressed because Murphy
plays a such believable dad, not to mention the acting job of having to
pretend to talk to animatronic puppets and look credible. This summer
must be Murphy's year, because he's doing a fantastic job in both DOCTOR
DOLITTLE and MULAN. Wow!
Some of the humor is low brow (burps, farts, dogs complaining about
enemas, etc.) but the overall theme ("we should accept people as they
are") of DOCTOR DOLITTLE is heartwarming.

Title
Review for Anastasia (1997)
Directed by: Don Bluth and Gary Goldman
Songs by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty
Written by: Susan Gauthier, Bruce Graham, Bob Tzudiker and Noni White
Starring the voices of: 
Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Kelsey Grammer, Christopher Lloyd, Hank Azaria,
and Angela Lansbury
Ingredients: girl with amnesia, young love, singing
Synopsis: 
In real life the twenty-year reign of the monarch Tzar Nicholas of
Russia ended with the Bolsheviks seizing power. The members of the
Russian royal family including Nicholas and his daughter Anastasia were
shot dead in a basement in 1918.  But luckily this animation story is a
lot happier; in this story Anastasia is alive and well! Young hustler
Dimitri (voice of John Cusack) and his old fat partner Vladimir (voice
of Kelsey Grammer) cook up a scheme to collect the reward money for
returning a lost Russian princess to her grandmother in Paris. All they
have to do is get an orphan girl named Anya (voice of Meg Ryan) to
travel to Paris with them, and have her impersonate Anastasia in order
to dupe the grandmother (voice of Angela Lansbury) for the reward money.
Unknown to them, orphan Anya, an amnesiac, really is Anastasia.  A long
time ago, when the evil monk Rasputin (voice of Christopher Lloyd)
assassinated her parents, the escaping Anastasia fell off a train and
lost her memory. The journey to Paris is long, and Anya and commoner
Dimitri fall in love. When she gets to Paris, will she choose her royal
title or will she choose the love of a commoner?
Opinion: 
This film is just like a Disney film, only it's not made by Disney (it's
20th Century Fox). My guess is that the unevenly paced storyline will
prove to be a little too complex for young kids, and a little sappy for
adults to sit through, but it is just right for girls hovering above and
below ten years old. On the good side this animated musical offers a
superb cast, great acting and singing, and fantastic and realistic
artwork. I like how the viewing angles zoom in, spin, and move around
like simulated camera-work, despite it being a cartoon. And who would
have thought Meg Ryan and John Cusack were so stellar at singing? This
film proves that directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman are (with minor
adjustments in movie pace and target audience) certainly capable of
making inroads into the formerly unassailable Disney cartoon market.

Title
Review for Earth (1998)
Written by: Deepa Mehta, based on the book CRACKING INDIA by Bapsi Sidhwa
Starring: Maaia Sethna, Nandita Das, Aamir Khan, Rahul Khanna
Synopsis: 
EARTH is a coming of age story and a love story set in 1947, in India, just
as the British colonialists are about to pull out and divide the greater
territory of India into mostly Muslim Pakistan and mostly Hindu India. The
story is seen through the eyes of Lenny (Maaia Sethna), a pampered, 8-year
old rich girl who initially has no idea what is happening. Lenny follows
around her beautiful nanny Shanta (Nandita Das), who is being wooed by a
group of male friends and suitors of differing religions and ethnicities,
since their city is initially a multicultural mosaic of Hindus, Muslims,
Parsees, and Sikhs. 
The upcoming partition of the territory gives rise to a creeping ethnic
tension, and soon the good-natured ribbing of the past gives way to
overpowering forces of chaos and strife. Through it all, Lenny sticks by
Shanta, who comes to symbolize colonial India itself: torn by competing
lovers and visions, lusted after by good men and evil men alike. 
Opinion:
You've seen epic-type love stories: LAST OF THE MOHICANS; TITANIC; WEST
SIDE STORY; et cetera. EARTH is one of the better ones. On the minus side,
the deliberate plate-breaking scene seems a little precocious for an
8-year-old kid (to be metaphorically pondering separatist movements), and
maybe 10 minutes of extra scenery can be edited. But there are a heck of a
lot more positives. 
Canadian/Indian director Deepa Mehta does a brilliant job resurrecting the
look and the inflamed passions of 1947. EARTH is visually spectacular and
haunting, with good music, scenery and acting. Its themes of true love,
chaos, and racial strife resonate as strongly today in 1999 as they do in
the movie setting of 50 years ago. EARTH the kind of movie you see, think
about, and see again, because it's an excellent love story and because
there are no easy answers.
One theme of EARTH is the idea of multiculturalism as a personal, moral
decision. As an example, these days it's considered okay to encourage
people to prepare for high tech culture: i.e. to study English, math, and
computers, and get rewarded with big money scholarships and high-paying
jobs. There are people who prefer alternate culture in the form of low tech
lifestyles and hobbies, but it's unethical to persecute them. We no longer
stomp to their doors carrying torches and hatchets, to hustle them to
draconian internment camps and relocation centers, imprison their leaders
for "reeducation," torture their spokesmen, rape their women, burn or
confiscate their homes, or declare them enemies of national unity until
they conform to high tech culture. 1947 or 1999, no matter what country we
live in or how it is partitioned, we all have a moral choice whether to
live together and actively encourage common culture and standards yet
tolerate multiculture (majority rule, minority rights); or, on the other
hand, to create a common culture through the ruthless and deliberate
extermination of rival culture on our turf, i.e. through ethnic cleansing,
genocide, intimidation, and repression. 
Does passionate, individual true love conquer all, or do big, epic forces
get in the way? See the movie. Then get the video and watch it back to back
with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Powerful film, recalling a powerful and relevant
era enable us to openly discuss human nature and hopefully avoid repeating
mistakes of the past.

Review for Danei mitan linglingfa (1996)
Written by: Kuk Tak-chiu, (Gu Dezhao) and Lo Man-shun (Lao Wensheng)
Starring: Stephen Chiau Shing-chi, Carina Lau Kar-ling, Carman Lee
Yeuk-tung, Cheung Tat-Ming, Law Kar-Ying, Manfred Wong (Man Jun),
Ingredients: Hero nerd, faithful wife, ancient Chinese kingdom with
Barney Fife-type emperor, outrageously costumed bad guys
Synopsis: 
FORBIDDEN CITY COP is a Steven Chiau comedy. It's the sequel to another 
Chiau comedy called FROM BEIJING WITH LOVE.
The setting is a shining Chinese City whose evil enemies from the
neighboring Gum Kingdom constantly plot the city's downfall. Among the
colorful bad guys are No Face Man (he has no eyes, nose or mouth), his
wife the Throwing Star Leaf Lady (blowing leaves act like ninja throwing
stars and kill people), and their son, Supertwin Guy (whose special
Siamese twin costume enables him to animate one of two connected bodies,
but you never know which). 
Nerdy main man Ling Ling Fat (Stephen Chow Shing-chi) is a smart-alecky
castle guard with contemporary humor. As the film starts, the Emperor (a
Barney Fife kind of guy) fires Fat because Fat is completely weak and
incompetent at kung fu. Fat can't compete with better superheroes on the
royal force, including Iron Clothe, Unbreakable Leg, Ghostly
Crossdresser and Five Animal Fists. 
Fat is skinny and weak, and he has no superpowers, but he has a lovely
supportive wife named Shing (Carina Lau Kar-ling). Fat is also a
talented tinker (he invents the helicopter among other things) as well
as a bungling herbalist, but his main concern is to redeem himself and
get back on the royal force. 
There are two main adventures for Fat in this film.
In the first adventure, the evil No Face Man and his minions plot to
kidnap the Emperor and to kill off all the doctors in China by luring
them to a bogus surgical convention, setting up a spoof of the Alien
Autopsy. 
In the next adventure, the Emperor sends Fat on a mission to spy on a
prospective concubine (Carman Lee) staying at the local brothel. Fat
ends up battling seduction and supernatural forces. 
Opinion:
Although FORBIDDEN CITY COP is primarily a vehicle for comedian Chiau,
the cast - -  especially leading ladies Carina Lau and Carman Lee - - do
an excellent job at fleshing out their lesser characters in order to
support Chiau's acting. The result is a well balanced and hilarious
movie.
Imagine a contemporary 1990s wimpy wiseguy in a NAKED GUN police comedy
thrown back in time to ancient China, and you'll have a good idea of the
style and pacing of FORBIDDEN CITY COP. The pace slows in the space
between the two adventures where nothing much happens, but once the
second adventure gets underway, the gags are again well-timed and funny.
FORBIDDEN CITY COP manages to spoof several familiar movies and modern
society including the Oscars and DR. NO.

Title
Review for Wrongfully Accused (1998)
Starring: Leslie Nielsen, Richard Crenna, Kelly LeBrock, Melinda McGraw
Ingredients: Parody about fugitive searching for the real killer
Synopsis:
In this farcical spoof of THE FUGITIVE a concert violinist named Ryan
Harrison (Leslie Nielsen) is seduced by someone else's wife (Kelly Le
Brock), and invited for a late night rendezvous. Reaching the mansion,
Harrison gets attacked by a mysterious one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed
terrorist, and framed for the husband's murder. Thanks to a lucky
accident, Harrison escapes from the prison bus, becomes a fugitive, and
attempts to find out who framed him. Meanwhile a crack team of lawmen
led by Fergus Falls (Richard Crenna) is hot on the trail.
WRONGFULLY ACCUSED is not an action movie, but a Leslie Nielsen comedy
similar to the  NAKED GUN series. The main idea is to poke fun at movies
such as ANACONDA, TITANIC, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, BRAVEHEART and THE
FUGITIVE through the use of unlikely comedic situations and rambling
dialogue containing movie theme cliches and catchphrases. 
Opinion:
The main character's name (Ryan Harrison) is obviously an amalgam of
Harrison Ford and Jack Ryan (Ford played the Jack Ryan character in the
movies PATRIOT GAMES and CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER), so most of the
parody revolves around Harrison Ford movies. In fact, there's even a
sendup of the scene where space hero Han Solo gets encased in a block of
carbonite. 
The comedy, however, is hit or miss. The farce is good (typically he
escapes one danger only to get bonked on the head by another), but the
parts of dialogue where Harrison goes on rambling discourses concerning
the Beatles and other topics are more boring than funny. On a scale of
one to ten on the comedy scale, I'd give it a six.

Title
Review for Kissing a Fool (1998)
Synopsis: 
A man and a woman who intend to get married attend a wedding reception
and ask Linda the publisher (Bonnie Hunt) how the bride and groom met.
In four or five vignettes, she explains the story to them:
Writer Jay (Jason Lee) and his editor Samantha (Mili Avital) are both
literary types, and they work together and are falling in love.
Unfortunately, Samantha is already engaged to Jay's best friend, Max the
womanizer (David Schwimmer). This situation is easily solved, since the
moment Samantha finds out Max is a womanizer, she can live guiltlessly
and happily ever after with Jay.
Opinion:
The problem with this film is that the situation can be solved in a half
hour sitcom, so KISSING A FOOL has a very difficult time stretching the
story out to an hour and forty five minutes. They do this by breaking
the film up into five or so comedic situations which last about five
minutes a piece. Each situation is then followed by a five-minute
let-down period where the joke peters out, and then the camera has to
switch back to an unconvincingly enthusiastic couple asking publisher
Linda what will happen next in the story.
One really strange thing that differentiates this film from all the
others I've seen this year is that in every scene, whether home, living
room, front porch, office, restaurant, or bedroom, people are gulping
down alcohol like fish taking to water. They guzzle tequila shots, wine,
and beer on a continuous basis oblivious to the fact that they are
alcoholics.
KISSING A FOOL is entirely predictable, and feels completely contrived.
There is one mysterious part where Max hands two envelopes to Jay and
Samantha, but the envelopes are never explained. On the good side, at
least the wedding reception and ending are happy. 

Title
Review for Kundun (1997)
Starring: 
Tenzin Yeshi Paichang, Tulku Jamyang Kunga Tenzin, Gyurme Tethong,
Tenzin Thuthob Tsarong, Tenzin Trinley, Tencho Gyalpo
Ingredients: 
Tibet, Tibetan music, Tibetan mountains, Tibetan costumes, Tibetan
villagers, Dalai Lama
Synopsis: 
KUNDUN is the pictorial biography of the fourteenth Dalai Lama, who is
still alive today (but exiled and living in India since the Chinese
military takeover of Tibet). The Dalai Lama is the religious leader of
Tibet. Tibetans revere him as the fourteenth reincarnation of a
compassionate holy man. KUNDUN traces the Dalai Lama's life story from
'pampered tot in training' to exiled leader. 
Opinion: 
1. The cinematography in KUNDUN is priceless and extraordinary.
2. The plot is so unnecessary you can turn off the dialogue and replace
it with music.
3. The music says 'Tibet' but is a bit repetitive and is suspenseful in
the wrong places.
4. Tencho Gyalpo does a superb supporting job as the Dalai Lama's
mother.
5. KUNDUN is an unconventional spiritual film with searing
cinematography.
In my hometown there was once a murder (where a dorky middle-aged guy
living with his wife in a cheap house killed her because she found out
he was involved with the mob. Hollywood turned it into a TV movie). They
portrayed the dorky balding guy as confident, muscular, square-jawed and
handsome. And they portrayed his nagging potbellied wife as a sultry,
hot seductive blond babe. The Hollywood-ized version of the story turned
their shabby roadside shack into a sprawling Beverly Hills countryside
mansion. But that's the way Hollywood movies are. They dramatize and
glamorize, trying to offer us better looking versions of ourselves doing
exaggerations of normal life. 
What if movies didn't do this? Then they might turn out like KUNDUN.
KUNDUN takes the opposite approach. Instead of giving us a glitzy,
schlocky 1990s Hollywood version of Tibet, with a slick plot, and
charming Beverly Hills guys and gals, KUNDUN gives us Tibet, in all its
peculiar timelessness. It plunges us into a weird kaleidoscope world of
ice-capped mountains and swirling robes and reincarnation where time
doesn't exist and neither do stories. KUNDUN is like opening a religious
photo album and seeing pictures come to life: individual grains of
falling sand; a holocaust-like dream scene of hundreds of dead monks
clad in red; a young bespectacled man looks wistfully through a car
window. With no big emphasis on plot, we in the audience are left to ask
ourselves what it all means in the grand scheme of things. Which is
probably just what Martin Scorsese, the director of KUNDUN, intended.
Remarkably, the entire film is a metaphor meant to mirror the mentality
of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.
This makes KUNDUN the cinematic equivalent of staring at the Grand
Canyon. There are only two possible outcomes. Either you'll wonder why
you should stare for two hours when the film apparently doesn't move the
way 'normal' films do. Or you'll be awed by the fantastic visuals and
emerge with a deeper sense of spirituality.

Title
Review for Snake Eyes (1998)
Ingredients: Hurricane, assasination, conspiracy, honest cop. 
Starring: Nicolas Cage, Gary Sinise, Carla Gugino
Synopsis: 
A boxing heavyweight title fight is held in a stadium in Atlantic City,
NJ as hurricane winds and rain rage outside. The fight is attended by
the US Secretary of Defense and his entourage of Navy men and industrial
associates. The Secretary of Defense has heard rumors of corruption, and
intends to meet a secret contact who claims to have information, but he
is assassinated by a sniper during the title fight, leaving 15,000
people to be detained as police witnesses during the tropical storm.
The policeman in charge of the overall investigation is Rick Santoro
(Nicholas Cage), a flamboyant cop of dubious morality who wears loud
clothes, gambles incessantly, and reaches for his cellular telephone
more often than a bookie or agent. Santoro may be corrupt and
well-connected, but he's also a competent investigator, and soon smells
a murderous conspiracy. Trouble is, all the suspects keep winding up
dead, until only one is finally left, and the final confrontation
begins.
Opinion:
Nicholas Cage fans will enjoy this movie, because Cage does a masterful,
if slightly over-the-top job of playing the intriguing main character,
Officer Santoro. In fact, Cage bails this movie out.
With a director like Brian De Palma you know automatically that the
movie's cinematography will be tight, that the movie will not be boring,
and that it will feature neat visual angles and suspense. That's
probably why the setting is a hurricane: so we can have lots of
lightning flashes and suspenseful shadows, De Palma style.
But the weak script of Snake Eyes creates a problem: basically the story
is too predictable to be a whodunit since we can all guess who the bad
guy is after only two seconds. Given a weak and somewhat unbelievable
story line, how do you prevent boredom and revive suspense without
resorting to ridiculous special effects, action stunts, and extraneous
car chases?
SNAKE EYES solves the problem by shifting its focus from whodunit to
character sketch. For example, instead of the big question being, "Who's
the murderer?" the movie focuses heavily on Cage's intriguing character,
and then pops the question, "How will poor Nicholas Cage react when he
finds the murderer's identity?" And so we sit through the movie as Cage
does his investigations all the way until the final confrontation, just
to see how poor Cage reacts. This new focus - - with emotional suspense
substituting for action-based suspense - - combined with strong acting
and snappy dialogue keeps us sufficiently hooked. Somewhat predictable
and fakey, Snake Eyes nevertheless entertains.

Title
Review for Perfect Murder, A (1998)
Written by: Patrick Smith Kelly. Based on a play by Frederick Knott
Starring: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen, David
Suchet
Synopsis:
This movie is about various battles between three characters. Steven
(Michael Douglas) is a greedy old rich guy whose fortune is going down
the tubes, fast. But he stands to inherit extra money if his heiress
wife dies. Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is Steven's beautiful unfaithful
wife. She is a United Nations linguist who doesn't love Steven, and is
having a steamy affair with artist David. Meanwhile David (Viggo
Mortensen) is a manipulative money grubbing ladies man who has targeted
Emily's riches. 
The story opens with Emily and David committing adultery, and Steven
secretly finding out about it. From then it's a question of who plans to
kill whom, and who foils whom. The greedy and clever Steven gets the
lion's share of the battles and schemes, battling both David and Emily.
Of course, one of the three plots a perfect murder, hence the title.
An interesting side character is introduced in the form of Detective
Mohamed Karaman (David Suchet) a sharp police chief who noses around
investigating the murder. 
Opinion: 
On the good side, it's interesting to see which one of the three
strategists - - David, Steven, or Emily - - will emerge victorious in
the end. On the bad side, the matchups are kind of lopsided. Steven and
David seem to be masters of deceit, while Emily's the kind of person who
- - soon after being brutalized by a thug - - deliberately wanders
around alone in a seedy lower class neighborhood. Emily shows promising
multilingual abilities which she uses to make the acquaintance of
Detective Karaman and some Hispanic tenants, but it turns out she can
just as easily complete her strategies without them, and in English.
I was a little bit disappointed in the weak alliance between Emily and
Karaman. As soon as Detective Karaman arrives on scene to investigate
the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity. Here's a guy who
can read human nature from a mile away. Karaman is brilliantly played by
David Suchet (he also plays Agatha Christie's Inspector Hercule Poirot
in the PBS detective series). He takes compassion on Emily, and
likewise, she connects to his Middle Eastern culture and language, but
unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies.
If you liked Michael Douglas as the heartless corporate raider Gordon
Gekko in Oliver Stone's WALL STREET, he gives basically the same
performance here. Meanwhile - - as the sleazy, long-haired artist - -
Viggo Mortensen does a complete about face from his crew cut navy Master
Chief John Urgayle role in GI JANE. Mortensen does a great job as the
reprehensible young artist. Of the three, Gwyneth Paltrow probably has
the most complicated character. Is she a cold and unfaithful vixen who
has latched on to a wealthy marriage of convenience, or is she just a
naďve linguist in search of empowerment?
It's tough to root for any of the three main characters when the
winner's got to be either an adulteress, a sleazy young manipulator, or
a greedy old manipulator. What good is a schlumpy, morally relativistic
message, right? However, it's interesting from a dramatic standpoint to
watch the actors/actresses one-up each other.

Review for Shu shan (1983)
ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (1983)
Chinese with English subtitles. 
Also called SHU SHAN or SUK SAAN (Translated: 'Suk Mountain')
Starring: 
Damian Lau Chung-Yun, Adam Cheng Siu-Chow, Brigitte Lin Ching-Hsia, Samo
Hung Kam-Bo, Randy Man, Judy Ong, Tsui Hark
Synopsis: 
In this Chinese mythological fantasy, I-chen - - a young army private in
16th century China - - gets tired of war, especially a battle which pits
uniformed reds, blues, greens, oranges, and yellows all against each
other in a pointless conflict. So I-chen sneaks off and becomes the
apprentice of superhero kung fu master Sifu Ting.
Unfortunately the superhero world of flying swordsmen and magical
weapons turns out to be just as petty and divisive as the normal-powered
world. The world's big heroes - - Ice Countess and her handmaiden,
Master Ting and Private I-chen, and a superhero Buddhist monk along with
the monk's apprentice - - don't want anything to do with each other. 
This is bad news because, due to a lack of cooperation, Sifu Ting, Ice
Countess, and the monk get knocked out of commission by the supernatural
forces of evil. This leaves the three apprentices (I-chen, the
handmaiden, and the monk's assistant) on their own to save the world.
The plot revolves around a big monster that will soon hatch into the
ultimate evil, spelling doomsday for the world in only 49 days. Only two
magic swords located in a far off borderland can combine into a weapon
powerful enough to defeat the coming monster. The three young wannabes
must go on a quest, find the magical swords, enlist allies, and save the
world from the emergence of evil.
Opinion:
While THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of the few mainstream American sword
fighting fairy tales involving comedy, fighting, and some magic, Chinese
sword fighting fairy tales are common in Hong Kong film. The difference
is, Hong Kong swashbuckling is often more 'over-the-top,' on the order
of SPAWN or other comic book fantasies. In ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC
MOUNTAIN people fly around like Superman. In addition, heroes can
levitate objects, control the forces of nature, and transfer their
powers to others. And they carry swords and shields and have big long
sashes and other enchanted weapons that can magically fly, spin,
duplicate, and take on a life of their own before returning to the
hero's side.
ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN is one of director Tsui Hark's
earlier works, before martial arts films had much of a budget - - so
you'll easily notice when the camera shot switches to a scale model - -
in contrast to the deft visual flair of the rest of the movie. This
gives the cinematography a stop-and-go feel. 
The wushu fight choreography is good, and the very beginning of ZU:
WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN features an outstanding and funny war
sequence along with some sharp quips on human nature made by the
characters. After the great beginning, the plot starts to get a little
murky. The characters also become less witty and more cardboard. Soon it
becomes confusing keeping track of who is who, as side characters such
as Long Brows, Heaven's Blade, and Lady Li-ichi are thrown in. The
finale of ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN features lots of flying,
but less martial arts.
The bottom line? ZU: WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN has a great
beginning. The characters aren't too deep, and the plot gets a little
murky, but the wushu action content is high, providing entertaining
action with little or no bloodshed or body count.

Title
Review for Rush Hour (1998)
Directed by: Brett Ratner
Written by: Ross LaManna (story) and Jim Kouf (screenplay) .
Ingredients: Reckless cop teamed with Hong Kong detective, comedy,
pratfalls, kidnapped kid
Starring: Chris Tucker, Jackie Chan, Julia Hsu, 
Synopsis: 
RUSH HOUR is a standard cop buddy plot uplifted by the presence of its
two stars: martial arts funny man Jackie Chan and comedian Chris Tucker.
Tucker plays main character James Carter, an outlandish and narcissistic
Los Angeles cop who is irritating to his superiors. As a result of their
displeasure, Carter is assigned to baby-sit a visiting Hong Kong
detective named Lee (Jackie Chan) whom the authorities want to keep out
of the way as they investigate the kidnapping of Soo Yung (Julia Hsu in
her acting debut), the young child of Lee's friend Chinese Consul Han
(Tzi Ma). But Carter and his new acquaintance Detective Lee don't stay
out of the investigation. They bicker over ethnic misunderstandings and
botch things up, but finally work as a team to solve the case. 
Opinion:
I were a teacher giving grades, Tucker would get a B. He's good and
funny, but his loquacious screeching is sometimes a bit much.
On the other hand, RUSH HOUR is proof positive that America is finally
catching on to the world's appreciation international megastar Jackie
Chan. Longtime Chan fans should be forewarned RUSH HOUR isn't a Jackie
Chan or Hong Kong picture; it's a Hollywood buddy formula where Chan is
merely the co-star. But despite not being the main character, Chan still
gets plenty of chances to amuse us by hanging from dangerous ledges,
climbing, leaping, kicking, or consoling a little girl. Chan gets an A,
and if there's a sequel, I hope he gets more air time.
RUSH HOUR is lively, entertaining, and will appeal to people of all ages
and ethnicities. The bad guys aren't impressive, and the plot is
routine, but Tucker and Chan provide sufficient charisma, comic lines,
timing, and acrobatics to give the formula enough enjoyable moments. I
took my parents to see it, and they loved it. 

Title
Review for Tarzan and the Lost City (1998)
Written by: Bayard Johnson, J. Anderson Black
from stories and characters by Edgar Rice Burroughs
Starring: Casper Van Dien, Jane March, Steven Waddington
Ingredients: True love, Tarzan, Jane, lost city of Opar
Synopsis: 
Tarzan, (Casper Van Dien) jungle lord turned society guy, is in Britain
preparing for his wedding to Jane Porter (Jane March) when he receives a
psychic call from an African medicine man, telling him that white men
are plundering Africa. Some bad guys led by Mr. Nigel Ravens are on an
expedition to find and loot the lost African city of Opar, considered
taboo and sacred by the African natives, who unfortunately, don't have
the guns to stop Ravens and his men. Tarzan sails back to Africa to stop
Ravens. Jane soon follows Tarzan to Africa and is captured by Ravens. 
Opinion:
Other than less vine-swinging for Tarzan, and a more liberated Jane,
there is nothing new to be found here. Like Kevin Coster's accent in
ROBINHOOD, the African language, songs, and drum rhythms in TARZAN AND
THE LOST CITY are obviously faked. Tarzan's British accent seems to come
and go as well. 
The plot also has a big hole in it: the African medicine man Mugambi
supposedly summons Tarzan for help, but the shaman apparently possesses
enough magical powers to easily handle the white men on his own; he can
turn himself into giant bulletproof snakes and hordes of bees, and can
make dead bones turn into magical warriors. Even the non-magical African
villagers are able to send Raven and his looters scurrying away into a
cave - - using mere spears and arrows. So why ask Tarzan to come over
from England? The only real purpose Tarzan serves is to rescue Jane,
who, predictably gets captured following Tarzan to Africa.
Is it bad? Not really. TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY feels a lot like a
Saturday afternoon made-for-TV movie. With the same movie set and
characters but a different plot, language, and music, it would have been
a sharper, more exotic film.
Actually TARZAN AND THE LOST CITY reminds me a lot of the 12 BOMBA OF
THE JUNGLE action series movies made between 1949 and 1955, which - -
according to MATT'S BOMBA THE JUNGLE BOY MOVIE GUIDE - - were created by
hiring a B-movie veteran as the director/writer, and using "a shoestring
budget with predictable plots and a heavy reliance on stock jungle
footage."
Campy and predictable? Yes, but good enough for a Saturday afternoon.

Title
Review for Wild Things (1998)
Starring: Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, and
Billy Murray
Ingredients: Sexy teenage bisexuals, murder, money, secret plans
Synopsis: 
When a movie has a name like 'Wild Things,'  I start to predict: either
the film is a PORKY'S style college-kids comedy, or it's one of those
sleazy B-grade flicks in the 'suspense' section of the local video store
- - the type filled with bottom dwelling acting talent: like maybe a
lady runs around in her lingerie, a guy gets decieved, and lots of sex
is somehow involved. Turns out, WILD THINGS is B-grade pulp sex, murder,
and money flick. The good thing about it is, if you can get past the
long (45-minute) beginning, WILD THINGS turns into a trashy entertaining
whodunit. 
In the small wealthy coastal Florida town of Blue Bay, high school
guidance counselor Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) stands accused of raping
nubile student Kelly Van Ryan (a gaunt Denise Richards). The film
proceeds with the standard rape trial plot until another hot high
schooler named Suzie (Neve Campbell) testifies with surprise
information, resulting in a lucrative settlement. So much for the long
part. 
Now the movie starts to get interesting. When persistent cop Ray (Kevin
Bacon) gets suspicious and continues digging up information on the
involved parties even after the trial has ended, Ray finds a video
camera and films hot high school babes in bikinis engaged in erotic
tongue action. Even more important, the involved parties start turning
up dead. What's going on here? Who is connected to whom, and who gets
the money in the end?
Opinion: 
Fans of scream queen Neve Campbell will be satisfied with her starring
role in WILD THINGS. On the other hand, Campbell and Denise Richards
play high school sexpots, and the ill-timed pedophilia themes of WILD
THINGS are likely to strike an angry nerve in American 1990s audiences,
since today school behavior and educational reform are THE hottest
political topics. 
WILD THINGS falls under a tried and true category: 'suspense, noir, and
deception among rich blue bloods at a beach front town.' But in a way,
it's a new spin on the old formula. Instead of featuring yuppies at a
New England cape or lifeguards and starlets at a California point, the
setting of WILD THINGS is Florida. Another thing that's different about
WILD THINGS is that after the surprise ending, the movie continues to
play, showing many little flashback scenes explaining the various tricks
the bad guy uses in order to deceive us. Very original. 
Director John McNaughton must be fond of twists and turns. The big
questions in this movie are: Who's the killer, who gets the money, and
what's the connection? But just when the crowd thinks it has everything
figured out, WILD THINGS tosses in another riddle.
Suspenseful erotic thriller? Not quite. More like B-grade whodunit, with
lots of gratuitous silicon and lips action. But I'll say this: trashy
and unbelievable as it is, WILD THINGS provides likable tongue-in-cheek
intellectual entertainment because it really keeps you guessing.

Title
Review for Education of Little Tree, The (1997)
Written by: Richard Friedenberg (adapted from the novel by Forrest
Carter)
Starring: Joseph Ashton, James Cromwell, Tantoo Cardinal, Graham Greene
Ingredients:
Little orphan boy, rural grandparents, mountains, Native American lore
Synopsis: 
In this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a
young boy spends with Grandpa and Grandma, the self recollections of an
unseen narrator focus on his world view as a Tennessee orphan boy
learning of his heritage through his grandparents. 
The setting is after the first World War, during the Great Depression
years. A nine-year-old orphan named Little Tree (Joseph Ashton) is taken
in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his Caucasian moonshiner
Grandpa (James Cromwell) and his Native American Grandma (Tantoo
Cardinal) in the wilderness of the mountains of Tennessee. Here Little
Tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - -
and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise.
Everything is miraculous to a child.
But it all comes crashing down for the boy when the U.S. government
forcibly takes custody away from Grandpa and Grandma, and forces Little
Tree to attend the Notched Gap Boarding School, a kind of internment
camp where multiracial Cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress, pray,
speak, and think like white people or face solitary confinement and
corporeal punishment.
Through his childhood experiences, Little Tree learns lessons about
love, race, life, death, people, nature, and folk wisdom.
Opinion:
This excellent, excellent family movie. It is one of those priceless
screen gems that nobody knows about because it's not highly advertised.
You won't find any formula schlock, cutesy characters, canned
spirituality, sequel teasers or commercial tie ins, but you will find
THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE to be a refreshing, impeccably acted,
original, wonderful, and touching film. Take the whole family and bring
a box of tissues for the tearjerkers. This one's as good as OLD YELLER. 

Title
Review for Big Hit, The (1998)
Starring: Mark Wahlberg, Lou Diamond Phillips, Christina Applegate,
Avery Brooks, Bokeem Woodbine, Lela Rochon, China Chow, Antonio Sabŕto
Jr.        
Ingredients: 
Hip young hitmen, suburban love problems, kidnapping plan that
backfires, running gags about masturbation and an overdue video tape
Synopsis: 
THE BIG HIT  is an action comedy about the weekend adventure of Mel, who
leads a double life as both an accomplished hitman, and a handsome but
wishy-washy suburban 20-something. In the story Mel (Mark Wahlberg),
Cisco (Lou Diamond Phillips), Crunch (Bokeem Woodbine), and Vinnie
(Antonio Sabŕto Jr.) are hip, young guys who make easy money as hitmen
for mob boss Paris (Avery Brooks). Unknown to their boss, one day the
boys moonlight by taking a kidnapping job on the side. But it all
backfires when their victim, a Japanese tycoon's daughter named Keiko
(China Chow), turns out to be Paris' godchild. When boss Paris comes
a-calling, Cisco, in saving his own hide, frames Mel.
Talk about a bad weekend for poor Maalox-swigging Mel! Aside from the
mob coming after him, several things happen: His mistress Chantel (Lela
Rochon) runs off with his money and another man. Mel must also field a
visit from his fiancee Pam's irritating parents. A zealous video store
clerk hounds Mel for an overdue video. Lastly, Mel begins falling in
love with the kidnappee.
Will nice hitman Mel ever get his life together?
Opinion: 
On paper it sounds great, but in the theater it's different. The action
content is fine, but the audience is asked to swallow some improbable
characterizations. For example, when - - early in the movie - -  Mel
forks over his entire salary to Cisco; it seems like an odd thing to do.
Also in the movie the kidnap victim Keiko falls in love with her
kidnapper Mel after about two seconds. That's a little quick.
As Mel, Mark Wahlberg (formerly singer Marky Mark) does an admirable
acting job. His action is pretty good, too, though Marky throws the left
hook a little slow because the deltoid is stiff. Similarly Lou Diamond
Phillips entertains adequately as the over-the-top fast-talking,
knife-swinging, gold-toothed Cisco.
Unfortunately, THE BIG HIT tries to be hip, but ends up feeling fluffy
and mindless because the action is pretty, but the comedy doesn't quite
succeed. This makes THE BIG HIT watchable in a cute, 'pop' sort of way,
but plot-wise the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere, even with cinematic
gunfire and explosions in the background.
I lived a number of years in Tokyo, where comic books are filled with
pop idol characters - - muscular arms, westernized, doe-eyed young hunks
with hip hairstyles; and female Japanese schoolgirl characters: all
blouses and skirts and high socks (or sailor suits), and the occasional
fatherly Asian tycoon stereotype. 
The concept behind THE BIG HIT is to insert these popular types of
characters into a Western setting, mixing American pop music, lingo, and
apparel with Hong Kong style action, choreography, and balletic
cinematography. This is all part of a larger trend - - something I call
the 1990s Hong Kong/ Hollywood connection, whose biggest players are
producer Terence Chang and director John Woo. 
Basically, in recent years a lot of Chinese talent has come to Tinsel
Town. Think of directors John Woo (Face/off), Tsui Hark (Double Team),
or Stanley Tong (Mr. Magoo). Or actors/actresses Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow
Never Dies), Chow Yun-fat (Replacement Killers), or Jackie Chan (Rumble
in the Bronx). All of these people, in one way or another, are on a
quest for a Holy Grail, the grail being a Hollywood formula that blends
elements of East with West to create box office success. 
I think this formula is feasible, as all of these people have had some
measure of success. But the 'magic' formula that works very time has not
yet been found. Some things work, and some things don't, sometimes.
And audiences genuinely enjoy action scenes and graceful cinematography,
especially if they augment an already strong plot. Watching a John Woo
or Jackie Chan film, one is impressed with the meticulous attention paid
to choreography sequences and graceful cinematography. Choreography is
one element of Eastern film culture that has successfully taken root in
America. Let's face it, nobody in the movies fights like John Wayne
anymore! 
A less successful element has been the idea of mixing action with
comedy. Hong Kong film likes to mix quirky comedy in with the action.
Most Western film stick with straight action (Diehard), but Quentin
Tarantino does the action/comedy thing, too. However, there's an
important East/West difference in the concept of comedy:
Much of Western comedy is situation driven. For example, in SEINFELD,
none of the main characters is a sendup of a stereotype, but each main
character is a bit eccentric, and gets into goofy comedic situations. On
the other hand, a lot of Eastern comedy is character driven. Actors
typically do over-the-top sendups of well-known racial or occupational
stereotypes. 
This comedic cultural difference has consequences. In THE BIG HIT Mel
meets his fiancee's parents. One is a comedic sendup of an alcoholic,
and the other is racial sendup of a Jewish mother. The portrayal is
meant to be funny, but I didn't hear a single laugh in the theater.
Similarly, another character in THE BIG HIT is an exaggerated nerdy
video store clerk; he didn't get an laughs, either. The sendup of the
Japanese tycoon father also fell flat. I see this as a cultural
difference. In the West, loony situation comedy goes over much better
than racial or occupational character sendups, which may be considered
borderline politically incorrect.
Another difference is the use of pop culture references in movies. Both
East and West use them. In Eastern movies, pop culture supplies a
decorative element of familiarity, much like the character sendups. But
in Western film, pop culture is always mixed with witty repartee or
dialogue (SCREAM, PULP FICTION, etc.). But in the West, pop culture
alone, minus the wittiness, is considered mindless MTV fluff. 
THE BIG HIT could be stronger if it replaces the overdone sendups with
eccentric originals, switched to more situational suspense for comedy,
pushes a stronger plot, and throws in wittier barbs. To make a long
story short, I like two things about THE BIG HIT. I like the premise (a
competent hit man doubles as an inept 20-something), and I like the
action sequences. On the other hand THE BIG HIT unsuccessfully tries to
squeeze comedy out of character stereotypes, and lacks snappy dialogue.
This succeeds to some extent, but comes off as 'okay' rather than truly
big. 

Title
Review for Amistad (1997)
Synopsis: 
In this movie, Steven Spielberg, one of today's finest directors,
attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the
fate of prisoner Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) - - a young angry man from
Sierra Leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow
prisoners. Cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of
America after escaping Spanish slave traders, but since the Americans
don't speak Cinque's language, the black men are hauled into court to
determine whether or not they are legally slaves. Technically, since the
international slave trade was outlawed at that time, people like Cinque
couldn't be kidnapped into slavery; one had to be born a slave to be
legally considered a slave. Lawyers Baldwin and Adams (Matthew
McConaughey and Anthony Hopkins) must prove Cinque and the others were
captured into slavery, rather than born slaves, in order to get them out
of prison as free men. Three lengthy court cases are portrayed with
Spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning, lots of facial
close-ups, big music, and dramatic imagery. A final speech by Adams is
followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened
to the various characters.
Opinion:
Making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life. In
fiction, one invents purposeful, clear-cut good guys and bad guys, puts
the fictional characters in conflict, and takes the tale to its exciting
conclusion. Real life, however, consists of long stretches of boredom
with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around, think
thoughts and do nothing, or come and go before events are resolved.
Spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life
story. Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins turn in excellent
performances.

Title
Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder
Synopsis: 
For those of you unfamiliar with the Alien' series, every Alien' movie
is basically the same formula: in each movie a small crew of humans
including Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is trapped on a spaceship or
planet full of drooling, big, alien insectoids. In the gloomy third film
of the series a morose Ellen Ripley gets impregnated with alien DNA and
kills herself. This fourth film, Alien: Resurrection,' picks up where
the third one left off. In Alien: Resurrection' a military/scientific
mission makes a living clone from the dead Ripley in order to extract an
alien fetus from her for DNA research. This leads to a situation where a
small multiethnic crew of humans including clone Ripley is trapped on a
spaceship chock full of predatory alien insectoids. The twist is,
because of DNA foul-ups, Ripley is now part alien (she has heightened
senses and her blood corrodes metal), and the Aliens are part human (one
skull-faced alien thinks Ripley is Mommy). Also we get to see aliens
ambush humans underwater in a flooded compartment. In a subplot, Winona
Ryder plays a waif-like smuggler wannabe who doesn't reveal her
mysterious past until the end of the movie. The humans are trying to
reach a small escape vessel on the other end of the spaceship. Can they
reach it before the aliens pick them off one by one?
Opinion: 
Prior to this film, the best movie of the entire Alien' series was
probably number two: Aliens' (1986, director James Cameron; it was
about a small multiethnic crew of humans including clone Ripley on a
planet full of predatory aliens) because of it's roller coaster thrills
and shootem up style. Next best was the original Alien' (1979, director
Ridley Scott), a decent sci fi flick. And coming in last was the
depressing Alien 3' (1992, director David Fincher). Now that I've seen
Alien: Resurrection,' I place it in second, right behind Aliens'
(1986, James Cameron). On the plus side, the special effects were fine,
and Sigourney Weaver did a good job acting. On the minus side, there's
only so much you can expect from the same formula the fourth time in a
row. And the dialogue's pretty stiff ("You have a monster in your chest.
Then you die."). This one's strictly formula, but has enough chase
scenes to be entertaining. Kinda funny, but French director Jean-Pierre
Jeunet (best known for The City of the Lost Children') likes to put in
little comic touches such as military generals that wake up with more
hair on their arms and chest than the average orangutan, and security
doors that identify by breathalyzer. 

Title
Review for Soldier (1998)
Ingredients: Robotic supersoldier, another planet
Starring: Kurt Russell, Jason Scott Lee, Connie Nielsen
Synopsis: 
>From birth, Sergeant Todd (Kurt Russell) and other babies are raised and
brainwashed to be the perfect soldiers - - robotic in mentality;
proficient in combat; unable to speak unless spoken to; emotionally
handicapped, and; unable to feel anything but fear and discipline. 40
years later, this line of soldiers is outdated and replaced by a new
line of genetically engineered and brainwashed soldiers. Todd himself is
junked, left for dead, and dumped on a garbage planet inhabited by
shipwrecked humans. One day when the army reappears and attempts to
exterminate the shipwrecked humans, Todd defend the humans against his
former organization.
Opinion:
Usually in flicks where the main character is not human enough to carry
the film, the side characters take up the slack and supply a lot of
drama and dialogue so that audiences don't get bored. Either that or the
action content is brought way up to compensate for no personality.
(Think of ET or THE TERMINATOR). SOLDIER probably won't satisfyingly
hold the attention span of most action-oriented audiences because there
are long periods of time where the emotionally handicapped Todd (Kurt
Russell) sits silently without saying anything at all, and the audience
is left to twiddle its thumbs. SOLDIER's focus is perhaps too much on
the silent Todd, but he doesn't say enough to make it interesting. The
second flaw is that there isn't really any believable reason for the
army to go to Todd's planet and attempt to exterminate the human
shipwreck survivors, other than to force a predictable movie ending. 
A last minute showdown isn't enough. SOLDIER's futuristic and
other-worldly setting might be good enough for a science fiction novel,
but SOLDIER needs to increase its action content, creepy crawly creature
content, or side character involvement throughout the entire film in
order to attract mainstream theater goers.

Title
Review for Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)
Written by: 
Jonathan Lemkin, Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, and Channing Gibson
Starring: 
Jet Li, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Rene Russo, Joe Pesci, Chris Rock 
Ingredients: 
Goofball cops, oriental gangster, illegal immigrant trade
Synopsis: 
What a web of tangled comic situations. In LETHAL WEAPON 4 police
officer Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) tries to get his partner Roger
Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to believe in the psychic power of positive
thinking. He also convinces Murtaugh that the reason a zany young cop
named Butters is so nice to Murtaugh is because Butters is secretly gay.
To make matters worse for the two cop partners, their irritating friend
Leo (Joe Pesci) has recently changed jobs from accountant to private
detective, and Leo insists on following them around. When together, the
talkative Leo and the gung ho Butters can easily spend an entire day
grousing about trivia. Meanwhile Murtaugh is trying to figure out who
his daughter's secret boyfriend is, and trying to keep secret an
embarrassing new source of income. Murtaugh also must swim away from a
big shark while on a fishing trip. 
On the other side of town sinister crime boss and money counterfeiter
Wah Sing Ku (5-time Chinese national wushu champ Jet Li) is running a
vicious slavery ring. The operation involves smuggling hopeful people
from China into America, in return for exorbitant sums of money that can
only be paid off by "indentured servitude" (slavery). 
Murtaugh and Riggs go after Wah Sing Ku's gang, resulting in high speed
chases, explosions, laughs, and some superlative martial arts moves on
the part of the incomparable Jet Li.
Opinion:
Sure, the characters are written a little older and wiser, but they're
also funnier. Riggs and Murtaugh entertain us, escaping certain death by
explosion and shootout, wisecracking all the way. Murtaugh's family even
gets to escape twice. I may be mistaken, but miraculously, his wife and
daughter appear captured in the burning building even after they have
already been rescued and set free after a standoff with the bad guys.
For those unfamiliar with the LETHAL WEAPON series, it consists of 4
movies not really about anything lethal, but about the exploits of
police partners Riggs and Murtaugh. Roger Murtaugh is an aging,
easygoing family man who loves his fishing boat, while his loyal younger
partner Riggs is a somewhat un-hinged prankster with suicidal
tendencies. The running gag is that old Roger secretly enjoys the madcap
adventures brought on by his unpredictable friend. To recap: In LW1
(1987) Riggs and Murtaugh nail the cold-blooded killer Mr. Joshua. In
LW2 (1989) they protect an irritating mob-accountant-turned-witness
named Leo (Joe Pesci), while busting a South African crime ring. In LW3
policewoman Lorna Cole (Rene Russo) falls in love with Riggs and helps
the partners put away a bad ex-cop. 
Characters Riggs, Murtaugh, Leo, and Lorna are all reunited in LETHAL
WEAPON 4, and a new comedian is added: Chris Rock as Officer Butters, a
gung ho young guy. LETHAL WEAPON 4 differs from the other movies in the
series in that the emphasis is more on comedy than on action, though it
still contains its quota of car chases, gunplay, explosions, and
hand-to-hand combat sequences. In my opinion, the fast-paced LETHAL
WEAPON 4 is one of the two best movies in the LETHAL WEAPON series.

Review for What Dreams May Come (1998)
Ingredients: Heaven, hell, life after death
Starring: Robin Williams Cuba Gooding Jr., Annabella Sciorra
Synopsis: 
During his life, a guy named Christy (Robin Williams) finds his soulmate
in a girl named Annie (Annabella Sciorra), marries her, and fathers
children. After death, Christy explores heaven, but finds life empty
without his wife and children, so he goes searching for them. Annie is
hardest to find because she's not in heaven.
Opinion:
WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is colorful and daring in its vision because it
attempts to portray the imaginary universe of life after death, and how
the soul of an individual can see beyond the material world and in fact
create entire universes. In its portrayal of heaven, hell, and life
after death, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visually exciting and wonderful
movie and a successful blend of computer technology with movie-making. 
That being said, despite good acting and imaginative concepts of life
after death, the plot of WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is entirely staid and
predictable, and the ending comes as no surprise to anyone. The movie's
main value lies in its ability to inspire.

Review for Phantoms (1998)
Written by: Dean Koontz and Tegan West, from a novel by Dean Koontz
Starring: Rose McGowan, Joanna Going, Ben Affleck, Peter O'Toole
Ingredients: 
Giant blob creature, four people trapped in a small mountain town
Synopsis: 
A giant ancient petroleum-based blob creature who thinks of itself as
Satan has killed a small town of 400 people, but it has left four people
alive: a sheriff (Ben Affleck),  a doctor and her sister (Rose McGowan,
Joanna Going), and a scientist (Peter O'Toole). Because the blob thinks
that it is Satan, it wants the four survivors alive to 'spread its
gospel.' Instead, the four people intelligently try to figure out a way
to kill the thing. Will they succeed?
Opinion: 
The movie starts out pretty well. A lady doctor and her sister are
driving their vehicle in the sunny mountains. They pass by a sign that
says, 'Snowfield, 4 miles.' Then the creepy music sets in. No sooner do
the sisters reach the town than they discover (gasp!) that everyone in
town is dead. In a better movie they might find themselves in a battle
for survival against an evil creature. But in this movie the evil
creature has already determined it wants the heroes to live, so there is
not much chance of the women ever being in danger. That's where the
movie begins to lose suspense; the audience already knows the girls can
never get hurt. The other thing is, since the blob has already killed
everyone in town in the first minute of the movie, there is not much for
it to do the rest of the movie but sit around and wait for people to
spread its 'gospel.' This doesn't make for an exciting or believable
movie. There are a couple of scenes were tentacles jump out of dead
people, and giant butterfly attacks the police, but it doesn't help the
movie gain any momentum.

Review for Man in the Iron Mask, The (1998)
Directed by: Randall Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART)
Written by: Randall Wallace, from the Alexandre Dumas class novel
Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Gérard
Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne, Peter Sarsgaard, Judith Godreche, Anne
Parillaud
Ingredients: 
Musketeers, greedy boy king, fancy costumes, father-son themes
Synopsis: 
Is there such thing as swashbuckler movie that has no swashbuckling in
it? THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK comes close. It's an action drama, but I
hesitate to use the word action.
The first hour and a half takes a long time. Basically it takes ninety
minutes to portray that 1600s ruler young Louis XIV of France (Leonardo
DiCaprio) is ice-hearted and cares little for his people. The last half
hour is fast: three old retired guys (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, and
Gerard Depardieu) plot treason. They try to secretly get rid of evil
king Louis XIV and switch him with a kindhearted look-alike. Meanwhile
their dear friend d'Artagnan (Gabriel Byrne), an expert swordsman who
has ties to Louis XIV and is also chief of the royal security force,
must decide whether his loyalties lie with the evil king or with his old
friends. In the end we learn why former hero d'Artagnan supported such a
bad king in the first place. 
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is actually a film version of a French literary
classic written by Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870), an author and playwright
best known for writing entertaining historical fiction. Dumas wrote the
three musketeers' trilogy (THE THREE MUSKETEERS, TWENTY YEARS AFTER,
and LE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE). LE VICOMTE DE BRAGELONNE, when translated
into English is subdivided into three smaller works; THE MAN IN THE IRON
MASK is the third of the smaller stories.
Opinion: 
Fans of TITANIC actor and recent Hollywood heartthrob Leonardo Dicaprio
get to see him wear a lot of hunky French period clothing as King Louis.
THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK also features an all star cast under the
competent direction of Randall Wallace (screenwriter of BRAVEHEART). 
Unfortunately, THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK rambles and wanders for an hour
and a half. Only the last half hour of the film has some kind of clear
goal or focus. In addition, the script feels strangely one step removed
from real' action or drama. For example, the movie has many chances to
show the tortured faces and poignant memories of main characters, but
instead, we get to see characters sit down and say things like, "I'm
doing this because I feel guilty." Instead of showing a man's face and
his memories of raising a son for twenty years, we see a guy merely sit
down and pout and say, "I'm doing this because I raised a son for 20
years."  Or instead of showing the reverence that all musketeers have
for courage, valor, and heroism, a character merely announces, "They
revere us." Put simply, the dialogue in THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
resembles a group therapy session, where there is much talking about
action and drama but the actual action or drama is sparse.
The other deficiency of THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK is that it doesn't let
us get to know the main characters.  For example, when Athos' son Raoul
dies because of the treachery of the evil King Louis, the audience is
supposed to care. But nobody in the audience knows Raoul and nobody
cares about him because the movie barely shows Raoul or bothers to
develop him. Later of course, Athos TALKS about Raoul, but that's
therapy talk again.
In THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK, the retired guys are supposed to be the
heroes. But a good solid focus on them doesn't appear until after 90
minutes have elapsed, so we aren't given enough time to know who they
are or care about their plan or their fate.

Review for Yatgo ho yan (1997)
Written by: Edward Tang King-sang and Fibe Ma
Starring: Jackie Chan, Miki Lee, Gabrielle Fitzpatrick, Karen McLymont,
Richard Norton
Ingredients: TV chef, damsels in distress, runaway horse and buggy,
swiveling steel crane, shopping mall chase, bulldozing equipment, gun
swapping scene, hallway with many blue doors scene
Synopsis: 
MR. NICE GUY is a Jackie Chan action chase comedy. In the film Jackie
plays a famous TV chef in Melbourne who entertains guests with his ginsu
cooking moves. One day, a drug kingpin (Richard Norton, sporting a
Steven Seagal hairstyle) and his thugs go after a lady reporter named
Diana (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick) who has just filmed their dope deal with a
rival gang and has it on videotape. While grocery shopping, Jackie
stumbles into Diane, saves her and gets on the bad side of the thugs,
who are now desperate to find the videotape that contains evidence of
their drug dealing. The thugs chase Diana and Jackie. When Jackie's
assistant Lakeisha (Karen McLymont) visits Jackie's apartment, the goons
go after Lakeisha as well. Finally, when Jackie picks up his girlfriend
Miki (Miki Lee) at the airport, the crooks decide to kidnap Miki. The
lightweight plot is little more than one chase scene after another, but
of course it's all just an excuse for many wonderful and impeccably
timed comedic action sequences by Chan. Can chef Jackie save himself and
the three women from the drug kingpin?
MR. NICE GUY contains around nine fight scenes showcasing Chan's amazing
blend of kung fu and humor. 
Opinion: 
Jackie Chan easily ranks with the geniuses of the silent movie era; he
is the undisputed successor and next evolution of the style of physical
comedy pioneered by such screen greats as Buster Keaton and Charlie
Chaplin. In these kinds of comedies the typical hero is the humble guy
with the expressive face, who through comic timing and athleticism,
manages to survive peril after hilarious peril and incidentally save the
damsel(s) in distress. Chan is a master of comic facial expressions and
timing, and he adds martial arts choreography to the comedic mixture. He
aptly demonstrates his unique style and talents in MR. NICE GUY. 
To be truthful, plot-oriented people might be disappointed with MR. NICE
GUY's whimsical plot ("All this hoopla over a lost videotape?").
Similarly, politically correct people might gripe that the women in the
film are mere bikini fillers. And fans of Chan's previous movies might
say the ending takes it easy (using a bulldozer instead of kung fu). But
these are small things; on the whole MR. NICE GUY is pretty
entertaining.
What I would like to see in a future Jackie Chan movie is a layer of
situational comedy that uses the drama of the situation to give more
meaning to Chan's physical comedy. Another thing that would be good in a
future Jackie Chan movie is to have stronger parts for the female leads.

Title
Review for Ronin (1998)
Written by: J.D. Zeik and Richard Weisz
Starring: Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan
Skarsgard
Ingredients: Ex-CIA agent, crew of former spies on a mysterious mission
Synopsis: 
In the Japanese legend of THE 47 RONIN, the master of 47 samurai was
killed by a rival nobleman. The 47 samurai, whose job was to serve and
protect their master, were so disgraced that they went into hiding as
beggars, thieves and assorted riff raff while plotting their
counterattack. One day they stormed the rival's stronghold and killed
their former master's enemy. Then, all 47 walked out to the courtyard
and committed seppuku (ritual suicide) by hara kiri (gut cut). 
RONIN's title refer to this ancient legend, and not to the 1990s modern
Japanese meaning of Ronin (high school students who are in limbo because
they aren't able to pass Japanese college entrance exams). In RONIN a
motley crew of broke and aging ex-agents from the Cold War are compared
to the Japanese ronin of legend, in that both are now masterless lethal
servants. 
The crew of money-starved ex-agents from the Cold War are randomly
thrown together by an anonymous high paying client who gives them
information and pays them through a mysterious Irish Republican Army
lady (Natascha McElhone). They are not given any information other than
that their mission is to attack a convoy of black cars in France and
recover a briefcase. This of course leads to shootouts and car chases
involving anonymous guys in sunglasses and betrayals by untrustworthy
teammates. The main character Sam the American former CIA guy (Robert De
Niro) teams up with Vincent, ex-agent from France, in order to recover
the briefcase.
Opinion:
The main character Sam is always trying to figure out exactly who has
mysteriously hired him, whom he's being hired to kill, and what's so
special about the briefcase he's supposed to recover. 
In the end, we do find out who the mysterious client is, but in the
meantime a lot of small token witticisms are revealed about how to be an
agent, and how to not ask questions, and how not to reveal too much to
interrogators. Despite all the chases and gunplay, RONIN is not an
action movie, but a kind of spy thriller explaining the character of
these RONIN: how they act, how they react, and what makes them tick. In
that respect, the contents of the briefcase and the identity of the
briefcase owners are completely irrelevant and only illustrate the
nature of this kind of work. 
One interesting thing about RONIN is its Western interpretation of the
47 Ronin legend. In the Japanese version, the 47 Ronin committed seppuku
to atone for their disgrace and dishonor in failing to protect their
liege. Basically they were saying, "We failed to protect the master. We
killed the bad guy, but that's still no excuse for our disgrace." In the
RONIN movie version, however, a Frenchman suggests to Sam that that the
47 Ronin actually committed hara kiri because, like the Cold War spies,
they found they no longer served a higher calling, and felt a kind of
exaggerated wistfulness over loss of mission. It's a small point of
East-West difference that in no way detracts from the entertainment
value of this neat little thriller.

Title
Review for Newton Boys, The (1998)
Written by: Richard Linklater, Clark Lee Walker, and Claude Stanush
based on a book by Claude Stanush
Starring: Matthew McConaughey, Julianna Margulies, Ethan Hawke, Dwight
Yoakam, Skeet Ulrich, Vincent D'Onofrio
Ingredients: Four bank robber brothers in the Roaring 1920s farm belt
Synopsis: 
In the Roaring '20s - - the era of prohibition, gangsters, and bank
robberies - - four country brothers (called the Newton boys) and their
partner Mr. Glasscock rob over 80 banks in the American farm belt
between 1919 and 1924. Meanwhile leader of the brothers Willis Newton
(Matthew McConaughey) romances a store clerk named Louise (Julianna
Margulies). Finally, when a business deal goes sour, the NEWTON BOYS rob
a postal train instead of a bank, and the Feds soon come nosing around.
What will happen?
THE NEWTON BOYS is based on the true story of the Newton family, four
young guns who were real life bank robbers in the 1920s. In fact, the
credits of THE NEWTON BOYS contains a Johnny Carson interview with
80-something former bank robber Joe Newton - - the youngest brother - -
who describes his younger days as 'crazy.' In real life the Newton boys
blew up safes at night when nobody was around, and they also refused to
shoot anybody throughout their entire criminal careers. But they were
successful as thieves, and they lived to tell about it.
Opinion:
THE NEWTON BOYS is not an action movie, but perhaps that's just as well,
given the material: the real life Newtons never shot anybody and did
their work when nobody was around. The film takes us from heist to heist
in a wandering, traveling fashion, with nothing really driving the plot,
and not much development of character, almost like a light dramatic
chronicle. 
In the 'screen hunk' department, this film has plenty: Matthew
McConaughey plays older brother Will; Ethan Hawke is Jess; Skeet Ulrich
is youngest brother Joe, and Vincent D'Onofrio is brawny Dock. They get
to wear a lot of classy suits, vests, and hats. And they drive
great-looking vintage wheels. 
As far as the script is concerned, McConaughey gets the lion's share of
lines, and does a good job with them. Unfortunately the other brothers
are not much more than interchangeable scenery. Ethan Hawke hams it up a
little bit by strumming the ukulele and swilling whiskey, but these are
mere gestures. Similarly Julianna Margulies does the best she can
possibly do given her small role. THE NEWTON BOYS is slow-paced light
fare focusing mostly on older brother Willis. It's like a meandering
documentary without a narrator, where the silent narrator is main star
McConaughey.

Title
Review for Species II (1998)
Ingredients: Blood, gore, breasts, astronaut infected with alien DNA 
Starring: Natasha Henstridge, Justin Lazard, Michael Madsen, Marg
Helgenberger, Mykelti Williamson, James Cromwell
Synopsis:
Since SPECIES II is a sequel, let's recap SPECIES before discussing
SPECIES II. In the original SPECIES film scientists receive a radio
signal from space with instructions for how alien DNA can be combined
with human DNA. They do the experiment, and presto! Out pops Sil (the
beautiful Natasha Henstridge), a sexy half alien half human woman who
goes on a mating rampage which morphs her into an invincible slimy,
terrifying alien. A government assassin named Press Lennox (Michael
Madsen) and a biologist named Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger) work
to track down and destroy the out-of-control human/alien Sil. But mostly
we get to see Sil strut and have sex with guys who don't know what
they've got coming to them.
In SPECIES II, astronaut Patrick Ross, and two pals go on a manned
mission to Mars to take some back Martian soil samples, but unknowingly
they get infected with Species DNA from a soil sample. The only
astronaut unaffected is Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), who is a
sickle cell anemia carrier. When the team returns to earth, astronaut
hero Patrick goes on a mating rampage which morphs him into an
invincible slimy, terrifying alien.
Patrick picks up a lot of hookers and kidnaps a woman from the grocery
store, and mates with them (killing them in the process) to produce
offspring who spin cocoons and hang on the ceiling.
Meanwhile, Natasha Henstridge, who played the original Sil in SPECIES,
now plays Eve, a friendlier, more docile human/alien whom scientists
have cloned from the DNA of the original Sil.  Dr. Laura Baker (Marg
Helgenberger from SPECIES) is heading the high security science lab that
studies Eve. 
When Patrick the alien goes on the mating rampage, Dr. Baker and
freelance security man Press Lennox (Michael Madsen) - - both from the
first SPECIES film - - are reunited to track down the slimy creature.
They hope to use Eve to help them find the alien, but the mating urge is
so strong that Eve escapes from the lab. 
Opinion:
There's not much you can really do with a movie whose main premise is:
"Oh no! We must stop him from mating."  Except make sure it's not too
serious, and have at it. 
Natasha Henstridge as Eve is gorgeous, and the cameraman takes advantage
of that, but her lines are limited; Henstridge has to do her best
putting character into a role that serves no function but to put sex on
screen. Similarly, Mykelti Williamson as astronaut Dennis Gamble has to
adlib and squeeze comedy out of his cardboard character. Kudos to those
two.
The other cast members don't bother to try very hard, and in fact
deliver forgettable lines with wooden performances. For example, after
all this blood, death, and destruction, Dr. Baker (Marg Helgenberger)
exclaims the understatement of the year: "My. This is awful." Or how
about Press Lennox explaining the alien mating urge to an unbelieving
military general? He says something like, "Do you want them to f--ck us
into oblivion?"
Or the scene where the camera focuses carefully on a corpse as a mini
buzz saw blade cuts through the dead woman's grotesque and bloody head
during an autopsy. The doctor nonchalantly says, "Let me move this ear
aside, now..." 
Given sharp and witty dialogue, they probably could have turned this
movie into the alien version of SCREAM. But SPECIES II sticks straight
to the gore genre. Basically SPECIES II is a tongue-in-cheek B-grade
gore flick, and is satisfying as such. It's all blood, bodies, breasts,
corny lines, and alien tentacles, but don't expect more.

Title
Review for Most Wanted (1997)
Starring: Keenen Ivory Wayans, Jon Voight, Jill Hennessy, Paul Sorvino,
and Robert Culp
Synopsis:
Sergeant James Dunn (Keenen Ivory Wayans) has killed an officer in self
defense. On the way to death row, he is rescued by a secret government
assassination team headed by General Woodward (Jon Voight) and invited
to join. But it's all a setup, and when the First Lady is assassinated,
Dunn finds himself holding a gun, and chased by the police, the army,
and the public out for the reward money. Apparently Dunn's being framed
by the corrupt General Woodward, and must find enough evidence to put
Woodward away while evading the forces of law and order. He gets help
from the head of the CIA (Paul Sorvino) as well as from a lady doctor
(Jill Hennessy) who has accidentally videotaped the real killer.
Opinion:
Nothing new or original here. This is a sometimes hammy B grade action
yarn, with some one liners minus the laugh track.  

Title
Review for Slums of Beverly Hills (1998)
Ingredients: Precocious teenage girl during the summer before high
school, family
Starring: Natasha Lyonne, Alan Arkin, Marisa Tomei
Synopsis: 
In this coming of age story a precocious girl named Viv (Natasha Lyonne)
lives with well-meaning family members such as a marijuana-smoking
brother and a ditzy female cousin (Marisa Tomei ) who has run away from
her rich home. The summer before high school, Viv discovers her breasts
have grown large. Before high school starts, she must learn how to use
menstrual pads and a vibrator, lose her virginity, and deal with her
breasts and family.
Opinion:
I applaud the efforts of writer/director Tamara Jenkins, who manages to
provide eccentric, sympathetic characters and writes quite well. At the
same time, I think the subject matter is problematic because of limited
appeal. There's probably not a very wide audience that finds summer
movie entertainment in pre-high school menstrual pads and vibrators.

Title
Review for Krippendorf's Tribe (1998)
Written by: Charlie Peters, from a novel by Frank Parkin
Starring: Richard Dreyfuss, Jenna Elfman, Lily Tomlin, Natasha Lyonne,
Gregory Smith, Carl Michael Lindner
Synopsis: 
In this comedy Anthropology Professor James Krippendorf (Richard
Dreyfuss) is disheveled, down on his luck, and badly in debt. His wife
has died, his children barely acknowledge him, and the demoralized
professor has already squandered grant money which was earmarked for
research on an undiscovered New Guinea tribe. 
When the day arrives when Krippendorf must give a speech on his research
on the lost tribe, instead of confessing that he has not found the
tribe, he tells a whopper. Fusing the names of his children (Shelly,
Mike, and Edmund), Krippendorf invents the 'Shelmikedmu' - - a
previously undiscovered New Guinea culture that lives in single-parent
homes. Shelmikedmu family units are supervised by the 'uta bagee' (Dad).
According to Krippendorf, the uta bagee must cook, clean, take care of a
dysfunctional family full of kids, romance new mates, and survive the
tribal version of divorce court.
The academic world is so intrigued by Krippendorf's tribe that soon they
pressure the professor for film footage. To keep the university and
creditors at bay Krippendorf and his kids soon find themselves creating
a studio in the backyard and wearing costumes in order to make fake film
footage. In the meantime, the fraud is also a good thing. After their
mother's death, the kids barely tolerated their father and each other.
But now the Krippendorf family is truly bonding.
Unfortunately, like the proverbial snowball rolling down a hill, the lie
keeps getting bigger and bigger. A skeptical academic rival (Lily
Tomlin) leaves for New Guinea determined to prove that the Shelmikedmu
don't exist. And when painted Shelmikedmu 'tribesmen' are spotted
running around in Krippendorf's backyard, it leads to guest spots on
talk shows for the 'chief 'of the tribe, an anthropology show on a cable
TV network, $100,000 in grant money, and the ever increasing possibility
that the hoax will be discovered. 
How long can the hoax last before it all falls apart?
Opinion:
Pretending to be a lost tribe leads to several humorous situations. The
professor and his romantic interest Professor Veronica Micelli (Jenna
Elfman) get to grunt and run around in disguise wearing penis sheaths
and body paint. He gets Micelli drunk, seduces her, and fools her into
donning a tribal costume in order to film the fake mating ritual.  She
gets revenge by making him eat live insect grubs on a national talk show
when he is disguised as the 'uta bagee.' Meanwhile the kids invent the
Shelmikedmu circumcision rite, steal goats, and chase a chicken. A
monkey farts. And so on.
The character changes are not done well. We don't know whether Veronica
Micelli is supposed to be a shameless self-promoter or one of the good
guys, but I suspect her character was meant to evolve from one to the
other. Similarly, the kids' evolution from dysfunctional family to
functional family is not portrayed clearly, and Professor Krippendorf
doesn't change at all throughout the story. Probably the original
intention of the screenplay was to have Krippendorf come to be a better
father, the kids evolve into a better family, and Micelli go from
self-promoter to gal hero, but it didn't play out that way. Basically
everything takes a back seat to the gags.
On the other hand, if laughs are what you are after, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE
delivers a lot of gags, and keeps them coming at a consistent rate until
the end. As a PG-rated sex farce, KRIPPENDORF'S TRIBE is watchable and
keeps an upbeat tempo.

Title
Review for Starship Troopers (1997)
Starring: Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Patrick Muldoon,
and Michael Ironside
Ingredients: 
Hero named Johnny, gun battles against giant mantises in space
Synopsis: 
If you've ever seen old World War II propaganda films - - where
late-breaking war news is highlighted by photos of spinning news clips
while a narrator with a high pitched voice barks exciting battle news -
- then you'll recognize the same cinematic style in 全tarship Troopers.'
The only difference is that in 全tarship Troopers' a story emerges
between the war narration. In the story a high school jock named Johnny
(Casper Van Dien) and his cute girlfriend Carmen (Denise Richards)
graduate and join the military. Johnny only joins to be near Carmen, but
when she runs off to become a space pilot, and he remains a mere
infantryman, they separate. Eventually Johnny gets his chance to save
Carmen when her spaceship crashes on a planet that his platoon is doing
a mission on. Meanwhile Johnny's buddies in the platoon capture the
giant brain bug responsible for helping oversized mantis creatures wage
war against mankind. 
Opinion:
Lots of bullets. I found 全tarship Troopers' kind of boring because
there was no suspense or emotional investment. I suspect director Paul
Verhoeven (Best known for 然obocop') may have intended the movie to be a
half campy tribute to old serials or war propaganda. 

Title
Review for Saving Private Ryan (1998)
Starring: Tom Hanks, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Jeremy Davies, Matt
Damon
Ingredients: Philosophy, World War II, humans trapped in carnage, rescue
mission, cowering, crying, killing
Synopsis: 
At the bottom of Nature's food chain, population in prey animals is kept
in check by predators. But among the top creatures there are no higher
predators. Often the top creatures themselves - - whether they be lions
or wolves or primitive humans - - keep their numbers low mainly through
vicious regionalism and territorial resource competition, using crude
weapons such as teeth and claws, or spears and arrows. The setting of
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is World War II, an era in history when Germany's
(and Japan's) "Manifest Destiny" included resource expansion and racial
exclusion on an immense scale involving advanced 20th century weaponry
and populations of millions, resulting in continuous, gruesome carnage
and psychological denial.
Among the countries resisting Germany and Japan was the United States,
at that time an economic heavyweight and regional power, but militarily
inadequate compared to the great powers. For example, Japan had the
world's most powerful and technologically advanced navy at the time of
Pearl Harbor. As a result of the United States' relative inexperience, a
situation occurred where ordinary American men such as kindly
schoolteachers and terrified, fresh-faced kids (today some would be
below the legal drinking age) found themselves responsible for
penetrating hostile territory to battle killing machines in an attempt
to stem the tide of Nazi expansion. Many combatants made the ultimate
sacrifice, dying like flies in a hailstorm. 
In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) is not a
professional soldier; he is more likely to read Emerson than to pack a
machine gun. But because it is wartime, Miller and a small squad of men
are unfortunately given an unwise suicidal mission behind enemy lines to
locate a lost but relatively unimportant soldier named Private James
Ryan (Matt Damon) and return Ryan to safety. Although the men question
and resist their mission, they eventually decide it is the only way
they'll ever be allowed to return home from the War, and so they
courageously do their duty. Finding and rescuing Ryan becomes a kind of
Holy Grail, symbolizing the desire of every man to protect innocent,
ordinary life from the brutality of war, even if the heroes themselves
risk being consumed, body and personality, by warfare.  
Opinion:
You can always tell a four-star movie because when the audience comes
out of the theater after seeing it, they look a little dazed, as if in
their minds some part of the movie is still playing. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN
is one such movie.
Most of us live pleasant lives of convenience, unmindful of gritty,
value-laden, life -and-death decisions that others have to make. We go
down to the grocery store refrigerator and select meat for our
consumption, our minds far removed from the physical act of having to
butcher the food ourselves. From plush, comfortable couches some of us
can push buttons that enable long range bombs to fly far away, and go
down the chimney to incinerate a cartoonish villain, or demolish an
electrical power plant in a rogue state. Or we may clap our hands when
we see it on TV. Like watching a video game.
But the exact same executions would have an entirely different effect on
us if we had to do them face to face. For example, what if we had to
stab and kill thirteen-year-old enemy soldiers ourselves instead of by
push-button? What if we had to live in the same building with civilian
families dying from lack of water, and eating rotten, non-refrigerated,
food as a result of the local electrical power plant being bombed? Or
suppose we were responsible for deciding from among our friends and
family, which member must die in a hail of gunfire in order to take out
an enemy station. In that case things wouldn't be so easy. Life would
take on a gritty texture. We'd be forced to clarify our values, who we
are, and what we stand for.
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN explores this idea. Ordinary men are sent into a
situation of utter carnage - - not to swagger and easily save the
universe as per usual summer blockbuster - -  but so that the film may
allow us to vicariously examine how Joe Everyman might feel in a FUBAR
situation such as the war our grandfathers faced half a century ago, a
war which we may yet fight again, if vigilance falters and human
inattention allows history to repeat itself.
Behind the scenes, somebody, somewhere is responsible for slaughtering
the food animal; somebody does engage the enemy; somebody does make
courageous, forgotten sacrifices in defense and nurturance of the common
good. The "dirty work" happens in history and every day behind the
sanitized curtains of our convenience in order to make possible our
pampered and privileged lifestyles. Accustomed to free entertainment,
facilities, and civil liberties, we only rarely ponder - - as the
characters do in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN - - the politically incorrect and
often disturbing concept of sacrifice.
While watching the movie inside the theater I noticed a father consoling
a teenage boy who had covered his face with his shirt because he could
not stomach the frightening, gut-wrenching visual detail of the war
scenes (bleached colors and on-foot camerawork along with periods of
deafness and slow motion make the audience feel as if it is partaking in
the mayhem). It is a tribute to Spielberg, his cast, and crew that
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN successfully captures the realism and emotion of
war. 
SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is a classic that is easily as good if not better
than the best previous movies of Tom Hanks or Steven Spielberg.

Title
Review for Urban Legend (1998)
Starring: Alicia Witt, Jared Leto, Rebecca Gayheart, Robert Englund
Ingredients: College kids, mysterious murders, urban legends
Synopsis: 
The plot of URBAN LEGEND revolves around Natalie (Alicia Witt), a
Pendleton College girl who discovers that everyone associated with her
is being killed off. The catch is that they're dying in accordance with
the plots of popular urban folk tales such as the story of the ax
murderer hiding in the back seat. Just like in SCREAM, Natalie's young
peers are familiar with these folk tales, so they know how death might
possibly occur.
Police never show up, and attractive college kids wander around and run
off to be alone in dark places where a villain who wears a hooded winter
parka in warm weather stalks them. People always run the wrong way
straight into danger. Evidence and bodies disappear, and in the end, as
tradition dictates, the villain is revealed to be someone who can't
possibly do all that lifting, clean up all that evidence, and survive so
many bullet wounds. 
Opinion: 
Urban legends are fictional modern folk tales passed off as true. A
couple examples are: the cat in the microwave; alligators hiding in the
sewers; a famous actor (you know his name) going to the hospital with a
gerbil in his intestine; feeding alka seltzer tablets to seagulls to
make them explode; seeing a girl walking down the street and finding out
later she died years ago; the kid who gets his pecker chopped off in the
bathroom; the choking Doberman;  et cetera, et cetera.
URBAN LEGEND features some of these, but I haven't heard of some of the
others. It's a somewhat campy movie that's not really suspenseful. But
at least we get to see who lives, who dies, and who the villain in the
winter parka turns out to be.

Title
Review for Rainmaker, The (1997)
Written by: 
Francis Ford Coppola, adapted from the novel by John Grisham
Starring: 
Matt Damon, Claire Danes, Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, and Danny Glover
Ingredients: 
neophyte lawyer, legal situations, corrupt insurance company,
Synopsis: 
Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who
must juggle three legal situations at the same time. Rudy's girlfriend
is attacked by her violent husband; Rudy's elderly landlady wants to
arrange her will so that her children are excluded, and; the family of
Rudy's friend with leukemia is suing the corrupt insurance company that
wouldn't pay for a bone marrow transplant. Rudy is new to being a lawyer
and is thoroughly outgunned, but luckily he is aided by a sleazy
ambulance chaser (Danny Devito) who has failed the bar exam six times as
well as by the kindly presiding judge (Danny Glover). Jon Voight plays
Leo F. Drummond, the intimidating and arrogant leader of the
all-powerful insurance company's team of lawyers who will do anything to
oppose justice. Will Rudy defeat Leo? Will he enjoy being a lawyer?
Opinion: 
The good news is that this movie has a happy ending, and it features a
guy trying to do the right thing. Director Francis Ford Coppola does
this film a little differently than the stereotypical law movie. In the
typical lawyer movie there's one big case and the movie focuses on
solving it, and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives
turn up before the good guy wins (after lots of gripping courtroom
drama). However, Coppola's movie is deliberately more low key. 'The
Rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young Rudy as he gets
emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side
characters. In the background Rudy's voice narrates his feelings and
makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general. Two
factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be. First,
Rudy's time is split juggling three cases, rather than concentrating on
a single high-stakes case. Also, Rudy's use of voice narration in place
of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge. The end result
is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win, and Rudy
narrates his way into coming of age.

Title
Review for Caught Up (1998)
Starring: Bokeem Woodbine, Cynda Williams, Basil Wallace, Joseph
Lindsey, Clifton Powell
Synopsis: 
CAUGHT UP is similar in plot to PALMETTO. In PALMETTO Woody Harrelson
plays an unjustly convicted man, freshly out of prison, who falls prey
to a seductress who tries to use Woody as a pawn in a lucrative
kidnapping scheme. Similarly, CAUGHT UP features an unjustly convicted
man named Darryl (Bokeem Woodbine), freshly out of prison, who falls
prey to the seductive tarot card reader Vanessa (Cynda Williams).
Vanessa wants to use Darryl as a pawn in her diamond-stealing scheme.
The movie takes place in three stages: the whole first half, the
beginning of the second half, and the finale. In the first half, Darryl
meets Vanessa. A masked person suddenly starts shooting at them, and
Vanessa tells Darryl that her jealous ex-boyfriend Ahmad is shooting at
them because Vanessa has never returned Ahmad's valuable stolen
diamonds. The story builds as if there will be a showdown between Darryl
and the psycho Ahmad.
In the second half of CAUGHT UP, Ahmad goes away empty-handed, and the
showdown is left unresolved. Vanessa is apparently dead, and Darryl
concentrates on solving the location of the missing diamonds. After the
diamonds are located, and most of the main characters die in a gun
battle, Darryl turns his attention to solving the identity of a new
gunman who may be related to Darryl's past. When Darryl solves this last
mystery, the movie ends.
Opinion:
The pace is good during each of the three stages of the movie, but at
the end of each stage, there is little or no transition, so there's dead
space where nothing interesting happens and Darryl isn't really
motivated to do anything but sit around and act confused. Because of
this the action seems to jump and rest, then jump and rest. One source
of confusion is when unrelated people from Darryl's past pop into the
picture - - for example, his old girlfriend, her estranged husband, and
a security guard from a bank make appearances in Darryl's life. Adding
to the confusion is when dead people get undead, good guys become bad
guys, and so on. 
CAUGHT UP is a good vehicle for actor Bokeem Woodbine to strut his
stuff, and he shows admirable versatility in portraying anger, fear, and
grief. Woodbine's costar Cynda Williams does good backup as a credible
seductress and con woman. 
The bottom line is that CAUGHT UP is an energetic and watchable B-grade
movie that suffers from the same weakness as PALMETTO: it tries to have
too much going on at once - - instead of having plot elements and
characters blend together in one smooth suspenseful run.

Title
Review for Out of Sight (1998)
Written by: Scott Frank, based on a novel by Elmore Leonard
Starring: George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames
Ingredients: Male bank robber, female federal marshall, true love
Synopsis:
A gentleman con man named Foley (George Clooney) busts out of jail with
the help of his friend Buddy (Ving Rhames). Their plans are complicated
by the accidental presence of federal marshall Karen Sisco (Jennifer
Lopez), whom they have to hide temporarily in the trunk of the car,
along with Foley. 
While in the trunk, Foley and Karen realize that they are both lonely,
both photogenic, and both people who enjoy romantic risks. If it weren't
for the fact of being on opposites sides of the law, they could be a
couple. Karen escapes, and the rest of the movie is mainly about their
attraction, not so much about action. When Karen learns Foley will be in
Detroit for a burglary, their attraction gets a second chance. 
Will he catch her or not? Will she catch him or not? Will they have an
argument? Will he fantasize about her? Will she fantasize about him? 
And will the ending be happy, tragic, or end with a nod and a wink?
Opinion:
In OUT OF SIGHT charmers George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez stand out in
marked contrast to anyone in this movie who is non-beautiful, since
non-beautiful main characters (especially Hispanics) are portrayed as
all dreadfully dorky, unintelligent, vindictive, and grossly
incompetent. Actually Karen Sisco (Lopez) is also incompetent any time
she's matching professional wits with bank robber Foley, but luckily she
always suddenly regains her toughness and intellect when dealing with
anyone else. Contrived, but hey, it's a romance. The thing is, I always
wonder is why there always has to be a weaker sex in a formular romance.
On the other hand, fans who enjoy the sight of George Clooney or
Jennifer Lopez will enjoy this movie, as it provides lots of glamorous
footage of these two stars in different clothing, hair colors, and
hairstyles, along with charming dialogue and flirtatious lines.
One interesting thing about the script OUT OF SIGHT is how it jumps back
and forth between prison conversations in a facility in Florida and
earlier conversations in a facility in Lompoc, California to show how
and when Foley met various criminal acquaintances. 
As long as fans know to be expecting a slow romance, rather than a
hard-hitting drama or action movie, the conversation in OUT OF SIGHT
should be enjoyable. The main idea ("What if a bank robber falls for
cop?") is never left out of sight.

Title
Review for Masterminds (1997)
Starring: Patrick Stewart, Vincent Kartheiser, Brenda Fricker. Brad
Whitford. Matt Craven
Directed by: Roger Christian. 
Synopsis: 
An androgynous-looking teen computer hacker named Ozzie (Vincent
Kartheiser ) mouths off to his father, stepmother, and younger
stepsister. His parents force him to escort his little sister to her
wealthy elementary school. But just as he finishes dropping his sister
off, the place gets taken over by kidnappers led by former military
commando Rafe Bentley (Patrick Stewart). The kidnappers seal off the
building and hold the kids for ransom, setting the scene for yet another
version of either 'Home Alone' or 'Die Hard'. Most of the movie consists
of scenes of people crawling around through ducts and sewer tunnels, and
the kid hero aggravates the bad guys' by turning on the school sprinkler
system. Bad guy Rafe Bentley (Patrick Stewart) escapes, but with no one
chasing him, Bentley mysteriously leaps his getaway dune buggy into a
sewer reservoir. Simultaneously, on the other side of town, the
alienated hacker decides to accept his stepmother and stepsister as
family, for no apparent reason. 
Opinion: This movie didn't know what to do with itself. It seemed like
the movie couldn't decide whether to be 'Die Hard' or 'Home Alone', so
it missed out on the advantages of both. The criminals didn't seem
driven or dangerous, and the stunts didn't seem believable, so
'Masterminds' wasn't a credible action movie. Yet the film also lacked
the physical comedy and charismatic cute kid to succeed as a funny
comedy. 

Title
Review for Haunting, The (1999)
Written by: David Self, based on the classic Shirley Jackson novel
Starring: Lili Taylor, Liam Neeson, Zeta-Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Owen
Wilson
Synopsis: 
Three people sign up to participate in an insomnia study for 900 bucks a
month: Eleanor (Lili Taylor), Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and Luke (Owen
Wilson). Little do they know, their kindly host Dr. Marrow (Liam Neeson)
isn't doing an insomnia study; he's doing a secret study on fear. Soon
enough the three subjects find themselves padlocked in a creepy old mansion
once owned by a demented industrial tycoon. 
Opinion:
The movie takes a while to get started. Nothing really exciting happens in
the first half. In the second half, the special effects take over, with the
haunted mansion doing a lot of morphing. These are great effects, but they
can't make up for plot holes you can drive a truck through. Like, how come
everyone keeps falling asleep if they're supposed to be insomniacs, and
they're in the scariest place on earth? Accompanying a suicidal friend,
what normal person would leave the hysterical friend in a dark, closed,
frightening, haunted room in order to get a cup of tea? Also shouldn't they
give Eleanor's great grandmother a name? Great effects, but what about the
story?

Title
Review for Steel (1997)
Starring: Shaquille O'Neal, Annabeth Gish, Judd Nelson and Richard
Roundtree
Synopsis: 
Shaq plays an army tech who works on high tech non-lethal weapons. He
quits when an accident injures a buddy played by Annabeth Gish, but then
goes home and notices his high tech weaponry appearing in local street
gangs. He invents an anti-terrorist suit of armor and dubs himself,
"Steel". 
Opinion: Shaq's acting has gotten a whole lot better. In this movie, he
even does a better acting job than George Klooney did on Batman. The
movie is better than Batman, and the  plot is also better than Batman,
with less distractions. But keep in mind this is not a big budget movie
with big name actors and effects. It has the feel of a made for TV,
tongue-in-cheek, made for kids, film. For example, everyone in the film
is pretty wholesome, with family type situations and no swearing. There
are some inside jokes such as Shaq being unable to hit a free throw, and
Richard Roundtree (he played a supercop named "Shaft" a few decades ago)
commenting on the "Shaft" of a weapon. Not bad as a made for kids film.

Title
Review for Return to Paradise (1998)
Written by: Bruce Robinson, Wesley Strick
Starring: Anne Heche, Joaquin Phoenix, Vince Vaughn, David Conrad
Synopsis: 
The setting of RETURN TO PARADISE is the real-life Muslim nation of
Malaysia, where all prostitution is illegal, and drug dealing and
sufficient possession are met with capital punishment. People bow in
Islamic prayer at prescribed times of the day. Crime in general is
harshly dealt with.
Enter Lewis McBride (Joaquin Phoenix), and his buddies Sheriff (Vince
Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad). They are three culturally disrespectful
young guys, who treat women like objects and indulge themselves with
copious amounts of marijuana. Sheriff and Tony escape to the United
States to become 'respectable,' but unknown to them Lewis gets caught
and predictably sentenced to death for drugs. 
Lawyer Beth Eastern (Anne Heche) informs Sheriff and Tony that Lewis has
received the death penalty, but mentions there's a possibility of Lewis
avoiding death if the two partners return to Malaysia to stand trial.
Can she pay or otherwise convince the cowardly and irresponsible men to
return to Malaysia to rightfully serve time for their offenses?
Opinion: 
Back in the old days, if you broke a neighbor's window, you paid for it.
In the post-Watergate era the mentality shifted to "Everybody does it.
It's only a crime if you get caught." Now, as prosecutor Kenneth Starr
might observe, we have whiny, apparently guilty offenders with one foot
in prison and the other foot in the grave, insisting, "I didn't even do
anything! Why am I being persecuted?" 
I'm a proponent of the concept of "audience justice" in movies. When I
see some B-movie RAMBO wannabe arrogantly announce, "I know this JUNGLE
like the back of my hand," I know in my gut that Mr. Know-it-all is
going to bite the big one sometime during the movie. RETURN TO PARADISE
seems to have forgotten the notion of good old fashioned justice because
the film tries to pedastalize its Ivy League heroes - - make them seem
noble and glamorous when in fact, there's nothing particularly
enlightening about pampered whiners who cry out for preferential prison
treatment on the basis of class, when in fact they are guilty as sin.
"Hey, man, we didn't do anything wrong because we were on vacation, so
we deserve better treatment than the locals." 
Speaking of bad old days, back in ancient cowboy and Indian movies it
was considered okay to portray Native Americans as "the only good Indian
is a dead Indian" if the cowboys were the main characters and
sufficiently handsome. As a modern American I had thought the days of
tap dancing kewpie doll servants and Frito Banditos were over, but
apparently the emphasis has merely shifted to Asia. RETURN TO PARADISE
is, unfortunately, a film that proliferates the unwelcome stereotype of
Asian women as gold-digging island sluts and prostitutes while the
film's Asian men are portrayed as ugly, bantering drug dealers or
sadistic faceless prison guards who bark incredibly ferociously, just to
say "enter" in Malay. In RETURN TO PARADISE, Muslims/Asians in this film
constitute a faceless race -- a barbaric, dehumanized, anti-white
"other." This is an unconscionable example of modern cinematic race
baiting.
I don't REALLY mind movies about moral yutzes. Nor do I mind in general
when a fictional movie portrays fictional characters on a fictional
island having sensationalistic adventures. As long as they're not naming
names and singling folks out for racist caricatures. 
But in RETURN TO PARADISE some good, kind, decent, technologically
advanced folks - - are referenced specifically by location ("Penang,
Malaysia") and singled out for overwhelming negativity. I have visited
Penang and found it not too much different than Honolulu in terms of
commercial trade, high technology, education, malls, theaters, and
general friendliness. RETURN TO PARADISE singles out these same highly
educated businessmen and women and their high tech Islamic society - -
for portrayal as ruthless overlords, pimps, degraded prostitutes and
sluts in a shantytown hell. Basically they took some GI's Subic Bay
fantasy and said, "Hey, let's call it Penang. Nobody'll notice. You know
how them Asian islands are all alike (wink nod)." This attitude is an
unpalatable throwback to shameful, feathers-and-shoe-polish, supremacist
notions in Hollywood.
In other respects, the cinematography and dramatic tension in RETURN TO
PARADISE are good, as is the acting. Anne Heche is skillful as the
lawyer under duress, but her chemistry with romantic lead Vince Vaughn
seems strained.

Title
Review for Deep Rising (1998)
Ingredients: 
Giant growling octopus creature that attacks a luxury ship, small band
of armed travelers which includes elegant lady jewel thief and whiny
mechanic
Synopsis:
In the story, Finnegan (Treat Williams) is the driver of a rinkydink
boat and Joey is his whiny mechanic pal. Finnegan and Joey get captured
by well-armed DIEHARD-type commandos who plan to hijack and loot a big
cruise ship. The hijackers force Finnegan and Joey to boat them over to
the luxury liner, but in the process the little boat gets broken. And to
make matters worse, when they reach the cruise ship they find that
nearly all the passengers aboard the cruise ship have been devoured by a
nasty giant octopus that has mutant tentacles that have jaws on the tips
that open up to reveal smaller tentacles with more jaws that open up to
reveal even smaller tentacles with even smaller jaws! But not everyone's
dead. A beautiful jewel thief (Famke Janssen ) and the captain of the
ship (Anthony Heald ) also manage to crawl out of their hiding places in
the luxury liner to hook up with Finnegan and the hijackers. Now if they
can just beat the octopus and get out of there.
Taking a page from the ALIENS (1986) formula, the band of armed
passengers wages a running battle against the big sea beast as it lurks
in piping and ducts - - and picks off the hijackers one by one at
appropriate moments. Will Finnegan and friends be able to get to the jet
skis that conveniently happen to be stored on this cruise boat in order
to escape?
Opinion: 
What happens when you combine SCOOBY DOO characters (minus Scooby) with
a TITANIC ship and monsters the size of ALIENS and JURASSIC PARK? Then
you get DEEP RISING, an action spoof where a whiny pessimist, a pretty
lady, and a square-jawed young leader cross paths with a corrupt sea
captain and a giant octopus creature aboard a smashed luxury liner
overflowing with water. But right away you can tell it's not a serious
movie from the dialogue. When one of the panting characters barely
survives an octopus attack, he asks, "Do you just GET asthma, or do you
have to be born with it?" And as in SCOOBY DOO, the corrupt captain
would have gotten away with his plot, too, if it weren't for those
interfering young people. You've seen all the action scenes before in
other movies, but what they hey, it's a spoof.
Star Trivia:
Famke Janssen is a former James Bond girl and Dutch supermodel who is
said to wear size eleven shoes. Wes Studi is a Cherokee Indian who
played the bad Mohawk Magua in LAST OF THE MOHICANS. Djimon Hounsou is a
West African male model who played Cinque in AMISTAD, but in this movie
he's one of the mercenary bad guys. 

Title
Review for Palmetto (1998)
Written by: E. Max Frye (based on the James Hadley Chase novel JUST
ANOTHER SUCKER) 
Starring: Woody Harrelson, Elisabeth Shue, Gina Gershon, Chloe Sevigny
Synopsis: 
Two con artists find the perfect patsy in Harry (Woody Harrelson) - - an
inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post, tries
to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye, has ill-timed fits of
coughing, and fails at everything he does. 
The story is told from Harry's point of view. Harry always carries
around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink. One day
Harry is approached by the con girl Rhea (Elisabeth Shue), who is
similar to Harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she
doesn't smoke. Seduced, Harry agrees to participate in a money-making
scheme involving faking the kidnapping of Odette (Chloe Sevigny), the
teenage daughter of a rich man. Turns out, it's all part of a needless,
very puzzling, extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme (it involves
hiring special impersonators) by two cons in order to fool Harry, a hero
who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post.  
When the 'kidnapped' Odette is found dead, the clues point to Harry as
the kidnapper/murderer, and the police are hot on Harry's trail. Harry
suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom
money. Can he get out of this mess?
Opinion:
PALMETTO is a long, uninteresting film with all the wrong feel. Hero
Harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently
overestimates his own intelligence. This farcical kind of character
works best in an entertaining NAKED GUN action comedy or DRAGNET spoof.
But PALMETTO is played like a dark, serious, detective noir drama, and
watching Harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating
distraction.
There's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the
camera goes wild on breasts, buttocks, short skirts, colored painted
nails, and women's legs. Even when the focus is supposedly on Harry and
his dilema, you can always notice the side of Elizabeth Shue's breast
forming a prominent foreground. 
Towards the end, PALMETTO re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a
confusing explanation involving impersonators, with Woody Harrelson
handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals'
confession. 
If you can imagine 'Shemp' from the THREE STOOGES playing the detective
hero of an HBO 'lingerie suspense' thriller, that's how out of synch
this movie feels.

Title
Review for Godzilla (1998)
Written by: Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich
Starring: Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Hank Azaria, Maria Pitillo,
Kevin Dunn, 
Ingredients: 
Try to imagine JURASSIC PARK, except replace the gawky Jeff Goldblum
character with nebbish biologist Matthew Broderick, and then make sure
there are no kids as main characters. Let dinosaurs run wild in New York
City; add mutated giant iguana, the Chrysler Building, Madison Square
Garden, a running gag about Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel. Stir in
spectacular effects.
Synopsis: 
GODZILLA (1998) is actually the 23rd Godzilla movie - -  an updated,
1990s version of the 1954 Japanese classic monster movie GOJIRA
(pronounced Goji-lah).
Let's do a quick recap of the title lizard's history before discussing
the 1998 GODZILLA further. GOJIRA is the name of the monster, derived
from the word kujira, the Japanese word for whale. In real life the
Japanese people of 1954 had lived through fire bombings and survived an
atomic attack which leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the war, so
GOJIRA was, understandably, a reflection of their post WW II anxieties.
Gojira (in one interpretation), was a dormant dinosaur, who, due to
irresponsible H-bomb testing, mutated to become the personification of
nature's inevitable revenge for man's brash and offensive tampering - -
a huge radioactive fire-breathing, civilization-smashing monster. 
Two years later, the 1956 dubbed English-language version of GOJIRA was
released as GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS. It added new footage of
Raymond Burr as narrating reporter Steve Martin to make the film more
palatable to American audiences. GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS had
three major plot lines: the military versus the monster; reporter Steve
covering the biggest story of his career, and; a love triangle involving
the brilliant hero scientist Serizawa who is rejected by the beautiful
woman Emiko.  
And now we have GODZILLA (1998), directed and produced by Emmerich and
Devlin, of INDEPENDENCE DAY. The story still involves a hero scientist,
rejection, his lady love, a reporter, and the military fighting the
animal. But while the old story has the male scientist's love dilemma
and the male reporter's career-making news story as two separate
subplots, the 1998 version condenses the two plots into a single,
tenuous romance involving a shy male scientist hero and an ambitious
broadcast news gal. 
Matthew Broderick plays brilliant biologist Nick Tatopoulis who was
rejected 8 years ago by the beautiful Audrey (Maria Pitillo). But now
Nick is investigating the possible existence of a huge monster created
by radioactive mutation, and Audrey is covering the biggest story of her
career: GODZILLA. Will they meet and resolve their differences?
In this 1998 version, the title lizard is not a dinosaur, but an iguana
mutated to gigantic proportions from French nuclear testing (which they
really did in Mururoa in 1995). Next the big iguana begins plundering
fish from fishing boats: he attacks a Japanese cannery vessel right.
Later Godzilla ransacks another net full of fish, dragging a poor tuna
boat down along with its cache. Why is the monster so eager for
mouthfuls of fish? It's up to Nick to figure out the mystery. Jean Reno
plays a mysterious Frenchman who helps Nick out. Meanwhile, the big
lizard takes a liking to New York, and goes stomping around on a path of
destruction that only two F-18 hornets (military planes) dare to
challenge.
Opinion:
It was probably inevitable that pop culture monster Godzilla would
finally be up for a Hollywood retread. In over 40 years the Toho Co.,
Ltd  monster was the star of 22 movies (in which he amassed a 24-5-7
fight record versus other monsters), toys, a cartoon, a comic book, and
several commercials.
The good news is that as a film GODZILLA is a big budget special effects
extravaganza, and can be quite crowd-pleasing, especially if you're into
dinosaurs, and you like to see stuff get smashed. With the right crowd
GODZILLA is an eye candy event, like going back in time to a 1950s
monster matinee, with folks screaming and cheering for the monster.
People who have never before seen a Godzilla movie can enjoy plenty of
fast, leaping lizards and snapping teeth.
As a script, GODZILLA is mediocre - - predictable, with uninspired
characters, a length perhaps 20 minutes over the mark, and a split in
attention whenever the big lizard leaves the screen and we're forced to
follow another plot about a subway search. GODZILLA also makes obvious
changes in the appearance and personality of the familiar monster, and
this could risk alienating nostalgic audiences even as the monster gains
a younger following through its judicious ad campaign and commercial
tie-ins.
After forty-plus years, the main difference between the classic film and
its new update is in Godzilla's personality. In 1954 Gojira is nature's
avenger; he has no fear of planes and eagerly roasts them with blasts of
fire or smashes them with his front claws; in fact he seems to relish
laying waste to Tokyo.  In 1998, Godzilla spends most of his time
running away from helicopters and planes, doesn't use his front claws,
and seems unaware that he can emit fiery blasts (total blast count = 2).
He's just an oversized beast in the way of man's progress. The monster
does show some promising flashes of intelligence during a submarine
battle, and some last minute fighting spirit at the end of the film, but
not much compared the old Godzilla personality. 
Probably the reason for these differences is because Dean Devlin and
Roland Emmerich are saving some room for Godzilla's future character
development. Get ready for sequels.
(I imagine something like this: Down and out, discredited biologist Nick
Tatopoulis gets the blame for last movie's damage to New York until the
CIA discovers evidence of another Godzilla, and comes back begging for
advice. Nick refuses involvement until he finds out his comerade the
Frenchman has disappeared and is in need of rescue. Evading a military
trap in New York, the monster swims up the Great Lakes and pops up in
Chicago where he wreaks havoc with the Bulls, Oprah, Jerry Springer, the
whales in the Shedd Aquarium, the Ferris wheel at Navy Pier, and the big
T-rex skeleton named Sue at the Field Museum. The monster uses burrowing
to make a nifty escape from the military, and then because of a
complication emerges mutated, bigger, and badder than ever, and climbs
the Sears Tower for a nasty climactic battle. One cameo involves a
cardboard box and the Taco Bell chihuahua, while another involves Kevin
Bacon and the cast of TREMORS. Don't mess with mother nature!)

Review for Tomorrow Never Dies (1997)
Starring: 
Pierce Brosnan, Michelle Yeoh, Jonathan Pryce, Teri Hatcher 
Ingredients: 
James Bond, scuba scene, car controlled by cellular telephone
Synopsis: 
Warped media tycoon Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) plots to start a war
between Britain and China in order to boost ratings by using a 'stealth
ship' to fire a captured British missile at the city of Beijing.
Super-agent James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) uses trick gadgets, pluck, and
charm in order to foil Carver's scheme. This time Bond teams up with top
female agent Wai Lin from China (Michelle Yeoh). The film contains
fights, chases, gadgets, and comedic moments. 
Opinion:
It does not have a casino scene or a ski scene, but TOMORROW NEVER DIES
is nevertheless a solid, enjoyable Bond movie. It neither stands out nor
disappoints. In old Bond movies Bond sometimes teamed up with American
CIA agent Felix Leiter. TOMORROW NEVER DIES introduces a new character
in the form of Chinese agent Wai Lin. Like Leiter's character, Wai Lin
would be a sure bet for a cameo in a later Bond movie.
Stars:
Michelle Yeoh was born a Leo in the Western zodiac in the year of the
Tiger on the Asian astrology calendar. I dont believe in horoscopes.
But at an airport I once browsed an astrology book with a section on Leo
Tigers (LTs). 
"Leo Tigers prefer enough solitude to grow at their own pace. LTs are
unbelievably courageous when facing adversity. The LT is also classy,
and has an excellent sense of refinement, but she sees herself as an
adventurer, and prefers freedom of movement rather than flashy status
symbols. This person loves family and friends with a fierce loyalty. She
delights in siblings, nephews, nieces and extended family - -  but she
must have her personal freedom to come and go as she pleases. Sometimes
annoyance at injustice drives her to take up one or two causes. In love
life, the LT has an unfortunate mental block against committing to any
partner who is less powerful than she." 
In real life, Michelle Yeoh is Asia's top female star. Like Jackie Chan,
she does her own stunts. She was born in Malaysia - - a country of many
languages - - and her primary language (the language she speaks in her
sleep) is English. She was taught Malay in school, and learned Cantonese
from bilingual parents. As an athlete Michelle represented Malaysia
internationally. She enjoyed squash, diving, swimming, and rugby. She
studied ballet at the Royal Academy of Dance in London, but switched to
drama after a spinal injury. In 1983 she won the Miss Malaysia pageant -
- without really intending to, since a family member had entered her in
the contest without her knowledge. Notoriety from the contest led
eventually to a movie career as an action heroine. Michelle has survived
a divorce with Asian retail tycoon Dickson Poon; a nearly fatal stunt
accident falling from a freeway overpass which put her in the hospital
for three months, and; a retirement from the movies. Her comeback from
retirement, SUPERCOP (1992) became the top grossing film in Asia that
year. It is not clear what Michelles martial arts style is, but it may
be a theatrical version of wing chun. Of her character Wai Lin in
TOMORROW NEVER DIES, Michelle says, "Wai Lin is the first Bond Girl who
is on a par with Bond, someone who can match up with him mentally and
physically." My own opinion is that casting Michelle Yeoh as agent Wai
Lin was an excellent choice.

Title
Review for Desperate Measures (1998)
Written by: Henry Bean, Neal Jimenez, David Klass
Ingredients:
cop who needs the bone marrow of a ruthless criminal for his leukemia
victim son, vicious violent bad guy who'll do anything to escape
Synopsis: 
Frank (Andy Garcia) is a widowed cop whose 9-year-old son (Joseph Cross)
is dying of leukemia. Frank is so desperate to save his son that in the
opening scene of the movie, he breaks into a government computer and
searches for possible bone marrow donors. Unfortunately, he finds only
one match: an incarcerated killer and dangerous genius named McCabe
(Michael Keaton), who is desperate to escape from jail. As the bone
marrow transfusion operation is about to begin, McCabe suddenly and
ingeniously escapes. Because Frank must keep McCabe alive in order to
have the transfusion to save his son, Frank finds himself at odds with
the police, who have orders to shoot to kill. Eventually, both Frank and
McCabe are fugitives from the law, but while evading capture Frank must
somehow capture McCabe and bring him in alive in order to proceed with
the life-saving operation.
Opinion:
I like the premise of this movie, the idea that a desperate cop can be
just as immoral as a desperate criminal. The acting is good. Andy Garcia
fleshes out the cop character nicely, while Michael Keaton does a
particularly good job as Peter McCabe, a criminal character who is
almost as dangerous and intelligent as the character Dr. Hannibal Lecter
of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. 
On the other hand, the movie seems contrived and predictable. Once
McCabe escapes from surgery, he doesn't do what any normal red-blooded
American criminal would do - - that is, get the heck out of there.
Inexplicably, he hangs around the hospital to harass the cop, the kid,
the kid's doctor for almost the whole length of the movie. 
In addition, good guys seem to bump into each other and pass along
information a little too conveniently. In one scene, as Frank is hiding
next to an elevator, Dr. Samantha Hawkins conveniently runs into him - -
and from nowhere, she produces Frank's lost gun and hands it to Frank as
if it were the most natural event in the world. Another time, when Doc
and Frank need to pass information to each other, by pure coincidence
she happens to be standing next to a window which just happens to be
right next to Frank who is standing outside on catwalk! This all just
seems a little too contrived to me. 
Since DESPERATE MEASURES is essentially a 'chase' movie, it also
contains many gun battles, scenes of running, speeding cars, and
explosions. Unfortunately, all of the action and running around takes
place inside the hospital, until McCabe pops out for an obligatory car
chase ending. 

Title
Review for Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)
Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) 
Written by: Mike Myers, Michael McCullers
Starring: Mike Myers, Heather Graham, Seth Green, Verne J. Troyer
Synopsis:
Sex-obsessed 1960s swinger/superhero Austin Powers (Mike Myers) becomes
impotent when his sexual prowess is stolen by archenemy Dr. Evil (Mike
Myers) and Evil's Scottish lackey Fat Bastard (Mike Myers). Heather Graham
plays Powers' female partner Felicity Shagwell (shag is the British
four-letter word for the word f-ck). Powers meets Shagwell, and they take a
time machine to the 1960s in order to thwart Dr. Evil. 
Opinion:
Blissful vulgarity is the main theme of THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME, a ribald
comedy that derives its snickers from phallic symbolism and devices such as
farting, corny profanity puns, and the narcissism of sex-obsessed
characters. Highlights include the scene where shadow silhouettes make it
appear as if Shagwell is taking things in and out of Powers' rectum,
bystanders remark about a huge, penish-shaped space shuttle, Powers drinks
diarrhea mistaking it for strong coffee, and two takes of THE JERRY
SPRINGER SHOW. One fat/ethnic line says: "He has more chins than a Chinese
phone book." 
Many critics feel that the PG -13 rating of this movie is a big mistake,
and I agree. Okay for adults, looney sex humor, overt profanity puns, and
repeated scenes of Scott Evil calling has father an ass should not be
standard fare for children. 
THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is an adequate comedy vehicle for Mike Myers-type
humor. It has some genuinely funny parts mixed in with a lot of so-so,
take-it-or-leave-it camp. Myers is versatile as three different characters,
and Heather Graham does an admirable job as straight-shooting sidekick
Felicity Shagwell.

Title
Review for Peacemaker, The (1997)
Starring: 
George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Marcel Iures,
Alexander Baluev, and Rene Medvesek
Ingredients: roguish man, scientific woman, car chase, military raid,
helicopter attack, bomb defusing scene
Synopsis:
A distraught Bosnian piano teacher named Dusan Gavrich (Marcel Iures),
has purchased nuclear weapons, but high ranking government scientist Dr.
Julia Kelly (Nicole Kidman) is on to his scheme. Kelly reasons that
since 44-E was written on an invoice from a German truck renter in
Vienna, and Bosnia is on the 44th parallel, and the United Nations is in
New York on 44th Street, it must all be part of a plot to blow up New
York City. Assisting her in finding and stopping the bomber is Colonel
Tom DeVoe (George Clooney), a rule-bending gung ho military man who
enjoys patronizing Dr. Kelly. Soon people are busy barking radio orders
to helicopters, police, and government soldiers while worried officials
swirl around ready rooms strategizing over big logistics charts. It's
all great fun, and as with all movies about bombs, The Peacemaker'
concludes with the obligatory big digital readout scene where the heroes
anguish over how best to disable the explosive device as it counts down
the time.
The Peacemaker' is the highly anticipated first motion picture release
of Dreamworks SKG (the movie-making alliance of  Steven Spielberg,
Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen).
Opinion: 
In search of the piano teacher, DeVoe and Kelly methodically check out
different parts of the world, but never once does it seem that one clue
will lead to another, or that the piano teacher will do anything other
than run, which means there's not a lot of suspense. However, most of
the scenes look busy, with lots of orders being barked and underlings
running frantically. This is enough to fill in the gaps between the more
exciting car chases and other action sequences. Although the acting is
okay (Clooney with his charming smirk and head tilt, Kidman as a nervous
but in-control gal), it is definitely downplayed as the movie is
primarily an action formula.

Title
Review for General's Daughter, The (1999)
Written by: William Goldman and Christopher Bertolini. Based on the Nelson
DeMille novel.
Starring: John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Woods, James Cromwell,
Leslie Stefanson
Synopsis: 
Military investigator Paul Brenner teams up with fellow investigator Sarah
Sunhill (Madeleine Stowe) to solve the murder of Capt. Elisabeth Campbell
(Leslie Stefanson), the daughter of political bigwig Gen. Joe Campbell
(James Cromwell). Elisabeth's body was found in an odd position: in the
middle of an army base, naked, and staked to the ground possibly
voluntarily. Brenner and Sunhill soon discover that the deceased was some
kind of nymphomaniac who had sex with nearly every man on base, so their
list of possible suspects is long. 
Opinion:
THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER is a film that tries to be riveting and shocking but
doesn't succeed because the film's details detract from the story line. For
example, the Sheriff's son is said to be the main murder suspect. Yet we
never see the guy: Sunhill and Brenner don't even bother to investigate
him. Or when Sarah Sunhill first enters the picture as Brenner's
investigative partner, we expect her to participate in the story as an
equal cop-buddy-partner. Instead, she just stands around and serves no real
purpose that Brenner can't accomplish without her. Travolta's character
Paul Brenner is supposed to be an ace military detective, but he can't find
a scrap of solid evidence linking the murderer to the act. In fact the
murderer seems to volunteer a confession for no reason when he could have
just as easily denied it. As a result of careless details THE GENERAL'S
DAUGHTER misses its mark as a psychological thriller.

Title
Review for Conrack (1974)
Starring:
Jon Voight, Paul Winfield, Madge Sinclair, Tina Andrews, Antonio Fargas,
Ruth Attaway, and  Hume Cronyn 
Synopsis: 
In this Vietnam era variation based on the novel "The Water is Wide" by
Pat Conroy, an idealistic young Causasian teacher named Pat Conroy (Jon
Voight) accepts a job in the deep South to teach a small class of 5th
through 8th graders on an island off the coast of South Carolina
populated mainly by impoverished rural agricultural Afro-Americans. At
the school, which is little more than a shack, Conroy discovers that the
students can't read, write, tell him what country they are in, or even
count their own fingers. They mispronounce Conroy's name as "Conrack." 
Whereas the principal Mrs. Scott (Madge Sinclair) belittles the students
and favors the whip, Conroy tries to personalize his teaching
experience, shares his life stories with the kids, and befriends them.
His classes include listening to records, picking flowers outside on
somebody's property, brushing teeth, yoga, football, watching sword
fighting movies, and a number of unconventional activities. For example,
when he learns that local kids often drown because nobody knows how to
swim, Conroy tosses his students into the water and conducts swimming
lessons.
Eventually Conroy's unconventional ways come to the attention of 
hostile superiors. Conroy comments that he believes the status quo is a
racial issue that won't be solved until racist attitudes are dead and
buried. 
Opinion:
"Conrack" is one of those "teacher" movies where a new teacher tries to
impact the lives of initially reluctant students. It is notable in its
portrayal of education. Rather than portraying education as a strictly
academic enterprise based on memorizing the three Rs, the point of this
movie is to depict education as mainly a vehicle for socialization. 
Conroy sees a problem with school officials telling the students that
they are poor, lazy and dumb, so that the students are being socialized
to think of themselves as poor, lazy and dumb. He sees education that
favors one social class over another or that portrays incomprehensible,
irrelevant situations as having little value. The trick for Conroy is to
make learning joyful through games and field trips, and to present
knowledge as a cooperative exploration of all that is relevant to the
kids' own life situations, and in so doing, educate. 
This movie matter-of-factly portrays the events and Conroy's thoughts
without boring us or resorting to long speeches.

Title
Review for Vampires (1998)
Written by: Don Jakoby, from the John Steakley novel VAMPIRE
Starring: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith
Ingredients: Vampires, vampire hunters, New Mexico
Synopsis: 
In this version, vampires can still be killed by wooden stakes and
sunlight, but garlic, crosses, and holy water do nothing. In addition,
vampires can also be created by botched exorcisms. Professional vampire
hunters hired by the Catholic Church are called slayers, while vampires
covens roost in "nests", presided over by a vampire "master." 
Main characters Crow and Montoya (James Woods and Daniel Baldwin) are
1990s vampire hunters. Their hit squad of slayers strikes the vampires.
Later the vampire master strikes back. Then the vampires reorganize.
Then the hit squad reorganizes. They all get ready for the final battle.
Meanwhile Crow must figure out who betrayed his name and location to the
vampires. 
Opinion: 
Heroes win, heroes lose, heroes fight the big stakes finale. That was
and still is the formula for all superhero made-for-TV fare. JOHN
CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is no different. The only new innovations JOHN
CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES adds are the sunny New Mexico (read "Western")
setting, the 1990s method of vampire killing (anchor them to a rope and
use a sport utility vehicle to drag them into the sunlight), and some
new mythology (vampires can be created by botched exorcism).  
JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES is fairly predictable, and main character Jack
Crow is a bit unsavory for a hero (he mouths expletives at his men,
shoves a woman, and slaps around an innocent young priest), but it's all
in good B-grade fun.

Title
Review for Cop Land (1997)
Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro,
Peter Berg, Janeane Garofalo
Synopsis: A small town sheriff who feels obligated to a popular but
dirty cop must decide whether or not to betray him when a victim of
attempted murder asks for protection.
This is a drama, not an action flick. This time, nstead of playing
Rambo, or Rocky or any other superheroic type of guy,  Sylvester
Stallone plays a sweet, slow-witted, pot-bellied, likeable sheriff of a
small town who wanders sadly an gently through a town that doesnt have
much excitement. The film is called "Cop Land" because the New Jersey
town that Sylvester patrols is mostly inhabited by cops who work across
the bridge in New York. Theres an atmosphere of conpsiracy since
throughout the film, it is made known that the mob has connections with
dirty cops who have connections with dirty politicians, but all of these
clues or not followed up on or explained. I loved the film and thought
it was a great bit of normal-guy type heroism and drama. 
Opinion: Whether or not you enjoy the film hinges entirely on one key
point - - it depends on how you interpret Sylvester Stallones
character. If you interpret Stallones character as a smart guy, then
youre going to wonder why he didnt investigate all those
conspiratorial threads and why things are left "hanging" unexplained. If
you interpret him as a slow-witted guy, then youll be happy with this
film, because the film is essentially a morality play, with the moral
that even a gentle, confused guy can make a moral decision to do the
right thing.

Title
Review for One Night Stand (1997)
Starring: Wesley Snipes, Nastassja Kinski, Robert Downey Jr., Ming-Na
Wen, and Kyle MacLachlan
Synopsis:
Max (Wesley Snipes) is a director of commercials who has a wife, two
kids, a dog, and house in sunny California. Unfortunately, Max is
unhappily married. In the beginning of the movie Max is alone in New
York to visit his best friend Charlie (Robert Downey Jr.) who has just
been diagnosed with AIDS.  By chance Max meets a lady scientist named
Karen (Nastassja Kinski ) who is attending a convention in New York.
Soon romantic sparks fly, and the two have a one night stand. Max flies
back home to California and has guilty feelings for a long time. Two
years later, Max and his wife Mimi (Ming-Na Wen) are in New York to
visit Charlie who now lays dying in the hospital. Max is shocked to see
Karen at the hospital; apparently Charlie's brother's wife is none other
than Karen. Not only that, but the passion between Max and Karen is
alive and well. What will the two of them do about it?
Opinion: 
Mike Figgis apparently had a big hand in this movie since, he was
director, writer, and the guy who composed the jazzy musical score. Did
he do a good job? Hmm. Interesting cinematography. Often the camera
moves between scenes by fading in and out of black or ending in a color
freeze-frame that becomes a black and white snapshot. The acting is
pretty solid, especially by Robert Downey Jr. as the AIDS victim. The
chemistry between Wesley Snipes and Nastassja Kinski is moderate, rather
than hot. Similar to When Harry Met Sally' but perhaps not as cohesive,
One Night Stand' is one of those life' movies where boy meets girl
while jazzy vocals and music play in the background. People who liked
When Harry Met Sally' would probably learn towards this movie.

Title
Review for Truman Show, The (1998)
Starring: Jim Carrey, Laura Linney, Noah Emmerich, Natascha McElhone,
and Ed Harris
Ingredients: Unsuspecting suburban guy, Hollywood director
Synopsis: 
In the island town of Seahaven, insurance salesman Truman Burbank (Jim
Carrey) is a Joe everyman who seems to have everything a typical guy
could reasonably want. He lives in a sunny upper middle class suburb
reminiscent of the idyllic Hollywood version of the late 1950s. He's
married to a pretty nurse named Meryl (Laura Linney). He's got a blue
collar beer buddy named Marlon (Noah Emmerich) whom he has supposedly
been best friends with all his life.  
But there are cracks in this bright, picture perfect, LEAVE IT TO BEAVER
neighborhood. For example, near Truman's home, a pedestrian carrying
flowers, a Volkswagon car, and a person on a bicycle are circling around
the block in an infinite loop. And why, during an argument between
Truman and his wife, does Meryl suddenly pick up a jar of Mocococoa
chocolate and do a product placement ad? One day, from out of a clear
blue sky, a big mysterious Hollywood stage light inexplicably drops and
breaks as Truman is walking down the street. Truman begins to look
closely at things and soon stumbles onto the fact that all is not as it
seems. The result is an excellent comedy/adventure.
Will the slightly paranoid Truman want to escape the perfect and
comfortable illusion of life at Seahaven?
Opinion:
When critics give a movie the highest rating of four stars, folks in my
neighborhood suspect that the film is either overrated, or that someone
paid off the movie critic (in order to jumpstart a stronger opening
weekend for an otherwise lame film). The question is, is THE TRUMAN SHOW
as good as the hype says it is? 
Getting straight to the point: Yes! THE TRUMAN SHOW is well written,
well cast, well performed and excellently filmed. TRUMAN is funny both
in the goofy physical sense, and in terms of inside jokes and sardonic
wit. As a plus, aside from being an engaging adventure, THE TRUMAN SHOW
is relevant to modern issues. The film manages to be funny, touching,
and meaningful at the same time.
THE TRUMAN SHOW is not a Disneyesque kids comedy (small children would
probably not understand it). Rather than playing a hyperactive comedian,
Jim Carrey steals the show with his performance as a sweet ordinary guy
who discovers, with some comic paranoia, the ultimate fakeness of his
world. To his credit (and director Peter Weir's), Carrey never hams it
up or overacts. He keeps it subtle, and as a result, succeeds
brilliantly. For example, Truman tries at various times to communicate
with his wife; she interrupts the conversations to espouse the virtues
of such items as brand name potato peelers and lawn mowers, and; he
looks at her quizzically, his face slowly revealing hilarious,
increasing paranoia.
For TV trivia fans, TRUMAN serves up a fun assortment of inside pop
references. It throws little jibes at 101 DALMATIONS, FROSTY THE
SNOWMAN, the Doublemint Gum twins, and dozens of other little goodies.
Even the names are rife with symbolism: Truman Burbank (true man,
suburb, bank); Meryl (Blond actress); Seahaven (sea, haven). My favorite
is Ed Harris playing the egotistical (he wears a little French beret)
island movie director Christof. This is a parody of contemporary
European artist Christo, who in 1983 surrounded some islands near
Florida with 6.5 million square feet of pink polypropylene.
Finally, THE TRUMAN SHOW offers an intriguing thought. At one point
Truman discovers that TV 'reality' is in fact a doctored creation. We
crack jokes about an American President we've never met; we cry over a
princess we've never met; we exult over the victories of a sports hero
we've never met; we fume over a foreign dictator we've never met. That's
the nature of our own information age reality - -  a reality where
carefully spun and tailored script characters and dramas are felt as
keenly as life at hand, and are accepted as real and normal behavior by
young children.
THE TRUMAN SHOW is a brilliant piece of writing by scriptwriter Andrew
Niccol. I highly recommend this film, and it is probably no exaggeration
to say that THE TRUMAN SHOW is one of the most important movies of the
1990s decade if not the century.

Review for U Turn (1997)
Written by: John Ridley (based on the John Ridley novel Stray Dogs')
Starring:  
Sean Penn, Jennifer Lopez , Nick Nolte, Powers Boothe, Joaquin Phoenix,
Billy Bob Thornton, and Claire Danes
Ingredients: 
down and out gambler guy whose car breaks down, frustration, remote town
in Arizona, sleazy women looking for a free ticket out of town,
lecherous underintelligent hillbillies, redneck police
Synopsis:
In this a dark comedy Bobby (Sean Penn) is driving to Vegas to pay off a
gambling debt when his Mustang convertible breaks down in a backwards
Arizona desert town. Through huge coincidences, Bobby loses all his
money and means of transportation. In town he meets an assortment of
annoying and exaggerated backwater creeps: violent unintelligent men and
sleazy women. For example, Jake McKenna (Nick Nolte) is an incestuous
lunk who wants Bobby to murder his daughter/wife Grace. Meanwhile his
wife Grace McKenna (Jennifer Lopez) is a mentally unstable woman who
promises to run off with Bobby if he murders her husband.  How can Bobby
get out of there before he goes nuts?
Although the cinematography is great and the performance of the cast
members is strong, it's not enough to overcome two things which are
poisonous to most moviegoers: unsympathetic protagonists, and the
depressing message that life consists of inescapable suffering.
In 1917 the famous artist Marcel Duchamp signed a men's urinal and
submitted it as artwork to the first exhibition of the Society of
Independent Artists -- the idea, I guess, being that it was the job of
the modern artist to shake things up and make the audience look at
ordinary things a new and different way.  To me, Oliver Stone is the
film director version of that mentality. Here he takes an old action
plot (adventurer gets stuck in a hellish hick town), and retools it as a
dark comedy set in the West that preaches a morbid existential message:
that life consists of inescapable suffering. 
Okay as art. But the difference between conventional art and a good
movie is that in a good movie the audience is supposed to identify with
and care about what happens to the characters. Aside from the ultimately
depressing existential theme, the central weakness of U-Turn' is that
its characters are colorful, but so disloyal and disgusting that the
audience doesn't really care what happens to them by the end of the
movie.

Title
Review for X Files, The (1998)
Starring: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Martin Landau, Mitch
Pileggi, William B. Davis
Ingredients: Aliens, conspiracy theories, two FBI agent partners 
Prior to a catastrophic bombing in Dallas, FBI agents Dana Scully
(Gillian Anderson)and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) are able to evacuate
the building. But when a few bodies are mysteriously found in the
rubble, the partners are placed before an FBI panel investigating them
for professional negligence.
A discredited author named Kurtzweil (Martin Landau) tells Mulder that
the bombing was a coverup: the bodies were actually dead long before the
explosion. The victims died of a peculiar alien virus: once the virus is
implanted into a human host, an alien fetus begins to form which uses
the human tissue for food and breaks out of the corpse as a malevolent,
full-fledged alien humanoid. Kurtzweil also insists that the coverup is
the work of a shadow government, a powerful cartel whose very existence
remains a secret. 
Although it sounds like a hoax, Scully and Mulder check out Kurtzweil's
tale. In order to acquit themselves before the FBI panel, Scully and
Mulder search for proof of the existence of either Aliens or of the
secret government, but as they investigate, sinister anonymous forces
try to stop them. As a result, the two partners begin to question their
dedication to each other, and their commitment to finding the elusive
truth.
Will partners Scully and Mulder continue to support each other? Will
their insistence that "the truth is out there" ever be vindicated by a
glimpse of the actual truth?
Opinion:
Imagine a dangerous fictional world where the truth of a situation is
carefully hidden from the public. For example, suppose an international
totalitarian corporation, selling unrelated products through fake
'front' companies, filled key scenes in Hollywood movies with
conveniently placed products, using product placement to subconsciously
influence movie audiences to buy things. 
An unobservant person living in such a world might imagine he/she lives
in a world devoid of influence, a world of complete free will, laissez
faire capitalism, with diverse products to choose from. Another person,
carefully noticing the product placement in movie scenes, might deduce
that he/she lives in a world of free will, but with substantial
advertisement from competing companies. Finally, the person who digs the
deepest might describe the same world as superficially free, but in
reality controlled by a cartel - - whose main objective is to get people
to part with their economic dollars, political votes, and other forms of
power in order to monopolize power for a sinister oligarchy which
exterminates competition and keeps the truth hidden from ordinary people
through the use of press releases, spin doctors, Hollywood agents, and
an army of lawyers.
THE X-FILES occurs in a similar imaginary world - - a cosmos where truth
is deliberately obscured by powerful groups who keep the truth hidden
behind illusory levels of misinformation. It seems there are three main
power groups: the US government (fairly benign, but always a good
candidate for secret agendas), the shadow government (people in powerful
positions, who for the last 50 years, have had access to advanced
technology and some ability to counter it), and finally Aliens from
outer space. The government, the secret government, and the Aliens all
have their own agenda: each group deliberately obscures the truth, each
group infiltrates the other, and each group may act in collusion with or
defy the other groups when a situation serves its purpose. Finally there
are also rebels and informants in the X-Files world. 
In such a convoluted world deluged with information and misinformation,
heroes are defined as ordinary people capable of honest love and
loyalty, who strive against all odds to perceive the truth - - and
occasionally glimpse a measure of it, despite the antagonism of powers
that be. In other words, heroes are individuals like government workers
Scully and Mulder. 
The main goal in the average summer action movie is for the heroes to
endure lots of chase scenes, and then wrap up by solving all the
problems and defeating a clear-cut villain by the end of the movie. On
the other hand, the main goal for an X-Files hero is to get a glimpse of
the truth in a decidedly untruthful world. As long as that distinction
is kept in mind, THE X-FILES is an enjoyable movie.

Review for Rushmore (1998)
Written by: Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson
Starring: Jason Schwartzman, Olivia Williams, and Bill Murray
Synopsis:
Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) loves writing plays. He is a 15-year-old
boy attending a prep school called Rushmore Academy. Manipulative, Max
claims his barber father is a neurosurgeon, and boasts to other students
about a (fictitious) sexual episode concerning his friend, a pleasant
schoolteacher named Mrs. Cross (Olivia Williams). Soon Max becomes
romantically obsessed with Mrs. Cross, to the point where his antics get
him expelled from school. The depressed teen he realizes he must act
within normal bounds to be socially acceptable.
Opinion:
I was hoping for an offbeat and lighthearted Bill Murray comedy, but was
surprised instead to find a quirky flick about an angst-ridden teenage
playwright. No problem. RUSHMORE starts out with one or two main oddball
characters, and that's a plus. The acting is solid, and you are
immediately pulled in to try to find out what makes the characters tick.
But aside from some flash moments of humor, that's as far and as fresh
as RUSHMORE gets. When the novelty wears off, the rest of RUSHMORE
doesn't seem to be propelled by any kind of dramatic event or
realization other than that time soothes anguish but not insecurity.

Review for Mimic (1997)
Starring: Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Alexander Goodwin, Giancarlo
Giannini, Charles S. Dutton, Josh Brolin
Synopsis: 
The main character - - scientist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) - -  has
genetically engineered a new species of insect and let them loose in
Manhattan, confident that the bug colonies will die out because she has
programmed the insects to all die off after a few months. Three years
later, however, some kids bring Susan a sample of bugs they found in the
subway tunnels. You guessed it! The bad news is, some of  Susan's bugs
are still alive; they have mutated and are living beneath Manhattan in
some old abandoned subway tunnels. After going down to investigate,
Susan, her husband Peter from the Centers for Disease Control (Jeremy
Northam), and some bystanders get trapped in the dark tunnels where they
are chased by a colony of man-sized man-eating mantis mutations. Can the
humans defeat the hungry bugs?
Opinion: This movie was pretty enjoyable, and not bad for a Saturday
afternoon creature feature with good special effects. The first half of
the movie paces itself like a normal movie. The scientific jargon sets
us up to believe that monsters could theoretically exist, while an
ominous human-looking insect (hence the name 'mimic') lurks in the
shadows and spies on main characters to build suspense. The second half
feels like a 50s teen horror flick, only instead of teens lost in the
forest while being stalked, it's Mira and friends lost in subway
tunnels, stalked by giant bug creatures. Not bad entertainment.
Possible complaints: On the downside, the movie's plot focus was a
little off. For example, the main character and big hero is supposed to
be Mira Sorvino, so in a regular movie, you would expect her to blow up
all the bugs or at least be a good leader for the human team. Not so.
She only gets to kill one bug, mostly by luck, while others characters
kill off the colony on their own.  The movie spends a good chunk of time
focusing on a mysterious young autistic boy names Chuy (Alexander
Goodwin), who has the uncanny ability to mimic the language of the
killer bugs. But all this skill is for nothing, since the plot never
makes use of the kid's ability. Finally during the first half of the
movie there's a female scientific investigator on Mira's team, who goes
everywhere taking pictures of evidence yet we never see her in the
second half. These unfinished threads disappoint but don't ruin the main
formula: scientific jargon and suspense in the first half, heroes lost
and chased by monsters in the second half, plus explosions.

Title
Review for Iron Giant, The (1999)
Written by Brad Bird and Tim McCanlies, based on a Ted Hughes book
Starring: The voices of Eli Marienthal, Jennifer Aniston, Vin Diesel, Harry
Connick, Jr., and Christopher McDonald
Synopsis: 
In this animated feature a giant, destructive alien robot (voice of Vin
Diesel) lands on Earth and suffers amnesia. The killing machine is
befriended by a young boy named Hogarth (Eli Marienthal) who along with his
beatnik acquaintance Dean (Harry Connick, Jr.) teaches the iron behemoth
about friendship and human free will. Unfortunately for Hogarth and his new
metal friend it is the height of the Cold War period in US history, so the
US Army and a gung ho government agent are bent on tracking down and
destroying the giant.
Opinion:
Great casting. FRIENDS waitress Jennifer Aniston is back in the familiar
costume, only this time she's a waitress who's also a 1950s single mother.
Crooner Harry Connick, Jr. is digging the beat again, but not as a
musician. In THE IRON GIANT Connick, Jr. plays a Beat generation artist.
Both Aniston and Connick slide into their roles and improvise effortlessly.
The artwork's pretty interesting, too. It's late 50s style, and if you went
back in time and showed the cartoon at a 1960s elementary school assembly
it wouldn't look a bit out of place.  
THE IRON GIANT plays low key on the emotions, yet it's a solid story
because of timeless ingredients that anyone can appreciate: friendship,
moral choices, action and the big showdown. Bring the family.

Title
Review for Postman, The (1997)
Ingredients: 
Post-Apocalyptic world, lone man, beautiful woman, evil warlord 
Synopsis: 
It is the year 2013. The United States has been destroyed and is only a
legend. Civilization is reduced to shambles. All that is left are
pitiful isolated settlements in the American West and Northwest that pay
tribute to a tyrannical warlord named General Bethlehem (Will Patton).
Enter a traveling beggar named Shakespeare (Kevin Costner) who does
stage performances for food, but is usually unwelcome in the suspicious
towns. One day Shakespeare tells a grand lie. To get accepted into town
he tells the people at the gates that he is a postman representing the
restored government of the United States. To everyone's surprise, people
really believe in the restored United States, and this eventually leads
to a full scale revolt against evil General Bethlehem, with a reluctant
Shakespeare caught in the middle of the situation.
Opinion:
Costner seems comfortable and in his element here, as far as acting is
concerned. This movie seems part WATERWORLD and part DANCES WITH WOLVES,
because the time period is post-Apocalypse like WATERWORLD, yet the
story takes place in the vast Western wilderness like DANCES WITH
WOLVES. Eric Roth, the screenwriter of Forrest Gump co-wrote the script
to this movie so of course it features a gosh-darn humble American hero
with lots of apple pie and cavalry scenes and flag saluting, and
American values. THE POSTMAN tries to be a sweeping epic about a lone
wilderness guy perpetuating a Santa-Clause-type lie that revives a
fallen America. If you go for a lot of horse-riding and flag-waving,
you'll probably like the movie, though it might seem about 30 minutes
too long. However, If you're not into all that Americana stuff, you'll
find THE POSTMAN watchable, but a bit corny. The way to approach this
movie is to watch it as if it's a Saturday afternoon HERCULES adventure.

Title
Review for Smoke Signals (1998)
Starring: Adam Beach, Evan Adams, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer, Tantoo
Cardinal
Ingredients: Two young guys on a road trip who can't get along, Native
Americans, fatherhood
Synopsis: 
Flashback: Years ago a tragic fire occurs in a home on an American
Indian Reservation in Idaho. During the fire an alcohol-prone man named
Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer) bravely saves an infant named Thomas, about
the same age as his own baby boy Victor. "I didn't mean to," Arnold
says. Tragically, Arnold becomes an alcoholic as the lads grow taller,
and finally he abandons his son Victor and the family.
When an unexpected phone call brings the news of Arnold's death in a
trailer park in Phoenix to the Idaho reservation, Victor (Adam Beach)
and Thomas (Evan Adams) are about 20 years old. Victor is somewhat of a
stoic, cynical person, while Thomas is an irritating, talkative, geeky
person. Although they don't have much money, the misfit friends set off
together on a quest to reach the Phoenix trailer park to recover
Arnold's ashes. 
In the meantime, they ponder who exactly Arnold was, why he left, and
the general bond between fathers and sons.
Opinion:
SMOKE SIGNALS is a tasteful and well-acted movie about a universal
theme: trying to understand why your father did the things he did, as
you were growing up. Aside from being a movie about two guys on the road
and the universal theme of men trying to understand their fathers, there
is also a pleasant and unique cultural background that pervades the
movie. SMOKE SIGNALS is written, directed, and acted by Native
Americans.
For example, when the son asks, "I promised you I would. You want me to
sign a written contract, Mom?" the mother replies, "Nah, we Indians have
a thing about signed documents."
The soundtrack is also very unique, especially for those like myself who
are unfamiliar with rock done in American Indian style. (Actually rock
music is ethnic by nature, since it is the blending of African rhythms
with the European chord schemes). Conventional rock music is on a 4/4
beat, but the timing of the notes in Native American Indian chants is
highly advanced; much more sophisticated than folk or rock. The blending
of Native American timing with the rock beat is fascinating. A good
example of this is the humorous song, "John Wayne's Teeth" which is
heard during the bus trip in the movie.
All in all, it's obvious that SMOKE SIGNALS was lovingly created by
people who wanted to bring homespun wisdom to life. If you've seen one
too many megastar schlock formulas this summer and are burnt out on
them, take a break and check out SMOKE SIGNALS.

Review for Living Out Loud (1998)
Starring: Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, Queen Latifah
Ingredients: Recently divorced woman, friendship, fantasy
Synopsis: 
The movie opens with the main character, a nurse named Judith (Holly
Hunter), learning from her husband that he has been having an affair
with a younger woman (Tamlyn Tomita). Cut to after the divorce. From
then on, LIVING OUT LOUD is mostly about the crazy little thoughts and
actions that Judith goes through in order to steady her life after the
divorce. Luckily she meets two new friends to help keep her mind off
things. Pat (Danny DeVito) is the gamble-holic divorced elevator man at
Judith's high rise. Liz Bailey (Queen Latifah) is a world-weary jazz
singer at a local club. Will Judith be able to weather life's storms?
Opinion: 
LIVING OUT LOUD is one of those quirky, meandering, interesting,
slice-of-life films. The whole idea is to map out how Judith comes to
grips with her emotions through smaller actions. Holly Hunter, Danny
DeVito, and Queen Latifah all give bravura performances, playing
complicated but thoroughly human characters who form temporary
alliances/friendships with each other for their own personal reasons.
There is no tight plot or easy, satisfying resolution to LIVING OUT LOUD
since it is more of an art house character portrayal (like a quick dab
of the paintbrush on the canvas of human relationships) than a big
screen exaggeration. I would love to see LIVING OUT LOUD adapted to
stage, where it would no doubt achieve immediate and resounding success.

Title
Review for Message in a Bottle (1999)
Written by: Gerald Di Pego, adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel
Starring: Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman
Synopsis:
Teresa (Robin Wright Penn) is a gorgeous, sexy, blond journalist who
works in an office chock full of ultra slim, lonely Ally McBeal types
all pining for a perfect man. One day Teresa finds an anonymous soulful,
poetic letter in a bottle along the seashore. Her boss publishes it in
the Chicago Tribune.
As a news project Teresa tracks the letter to its author Garret (Kevin
Costner), who is not your average sweaty shantytown dock worker. Aside
from being in dire need of a woman's nurturance to tend his emotional
heartache, Garret builds his own ships and sails them, writes poetry,
looks gorgeous in a yachting sweater, admires fine wine and romantic
bonfires, loves children, and has a close relationship with a charming
father who looks like Paul Newman.
Since soulful, hunky, eligible bachelors are hard to come by, Teresa
makes herself available to Garret so they can pursue a romantic
relationship. Teresa and Garret cuddle and couple and romance each other
for a long time while the audience waits for the inevitable moment when
Garret must stomach the unpleasant revelation that he was originally a
news story and research task. Will love prevail for the power couple?
Opinion:
MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE is a date flick whose protagonists have been around
the marriage carousel once or twice. The bad news is that the movie is
predictable, too long, and has an unsatisfying conclusion. The good news
is that MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE offers ladies two screen hunks for the price
of one. Newman steals the show with his one-liners as the charming
father. And Costner is at his "aw shucks" cutest when he says little,
plays tender, and wears hunky clothing. MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE is two hours
of picturesque, seaside cinematography and satisfying if predictable
romance - - tailor-made for ladies who are fans of Newman and Costner.
But the ending is disappointing.

Review for Deep Blue Sea (1999)
Written by: Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers and Wayne Powers
Starring: Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J,
Michael Rapaport
Synopsis: 
In a floating research facility called Aquatica, proteins are harvested
from the brains of three mako sharks as part of research on a cure for
Alzheimer's disease. Mako sharks, a species where the female is much larger
than the male, are some of the fastest, highest leaping fish in the world,
as well as possibly the most the most intelligent type of shark and a
leader in attacks on boats. An unfortunate consequence of the Aquatica
research is that it enhances the size, invulnerability, and intelligence of
the three sharks. The humans seem firmly in control, but when an accident
happens, guess who's got the upper hand?
Opinion:
Who will survive? The beautiful but ice-cold lady scientist, the reformed
convict? The depressed research assistant or her smokaholic boyfriend, the
baby-faced engineer, the rich financier, or the cook? DEEP BLUE SEA is no
cliches and all surprises. It'll put you on the edge of your seat more
times than the original Jurassic Park. DEEP BLUE SEA was the funnest movie
I've seen all summer, and I highly recommend it for an outing of scary fun
and entertainment.

Review for Sixth Sense, The (1999)
Starring: Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment
Synopsis: 
Hotshot psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) thinks he's on top of the
world until a suicidal patient shows up with a gun. A year later,
thoroughly shaken, with his marriage falling apart and professional skills
waning, Crowe stumbles on the chance to help a frightened 9-year old boy
named Cole (Haley Joel Osment) who is having hallucinations of seeing dead
people. 
Opinion:
Writer/ N. Night Shyamalan knows how to break the rules and get away with
it. Instead of plying us with special effects and a predictable story line,
Shyamalan keeps suspense hanging just in the background, ready to dart out
at any moment, as he focuses on the relationship between Crowe and the kid.
It's wonderful to watch the negotiation between actors Bruce Willis and
Haley Joel Osment. Is the shaken boy taking refuge in the steadfastness of
Crowe, or is the shaken Crowe finding refuge in helping the boy? Then, just
as you think things are beginning to settle . . . boom! The ending is a
doozy, and it makes complete sense, but I won't reveal it. Despite its
title THE SIXTH SENSE has nothing to do with extrasensory perception. But
it's the best ghost story I've seen in years.

Review for Mo him wong (1996)
DR. WAI IN THE SCRIPTURE WITH NO WORDS (1996)
Chinese, with English subtitles
Directed by: Ching Siu-Tung (Cheng Xiaodong) most famous for the CHINESE
GHOST STORY movies
Starring: 
Jet Li Lian-Jie, Rosamund Kwan Chi-Lam, Takeshi Kaneshiro (Gum Sing-Mo),
Charlie Yeung Choi-Nei, Billy Chow, Johnny Kong, Law Kar-Ying, Ngai Sing
Written by: Sandy Shaw (Siu Lai-King), Szeto Cheuk-Han, Ah Lun (Lam
Wai-Lun)
Ingredients: Indiana Jones-type hero, serial adventure, Nazi-ish
caricature villains, torch lit temple, race to find wooden box
containing untold power
Synopsis: 
In this action comedy, Jet Li is Chow Si-kit, a down-and-out serial
writer whose beautiful wife Monica (Rosamund Kwan) is on the verge of
divorcing him. Si-kit is supposed to be writing the next few chapters of
THE ADVENTURE KING, starring the adventures of Dr. Wai, an Indiana Jones
style adventurer - - but he's too depressed and he's out of ideas, and
the deadline for finishing the last seven of 100 episodes is fast coming
up.
This clever plot twist allows the movie to become two stories at once.
On the one hand, Si-kit the writer and his two young assistants (Takeshi
Kaneshiro, cute Charlie Yeung) find that their suggestion box for ideas
is empty and has run out of idea slips. They tangle with Si-kit's wife
Monica, who can't seem to decide whether to love Si-kit or leave him.
On the other hand, in the serial adventure, Dr. Wai and his assistants
tangle with the dangerous Cammy, Dr. Wai's love interest who can't
decide whether to be evil or to be good in a storyline about locating a
mysterious empty box and reuniting it with a scroll called 'the
scripture with no words.'
Opinion:
This is a very entertaining movie that has an independent, zany feel to
it - - with lots of potential situation comedy. The plot takes several
funny twists and turns because Si-kit, the assistants, and Monica try to
one-up each other as they get a hold of each episode, and write the next
episode in a way that favors their character while the others are not
looking.
Another source of comedy was the over-the-top style of adventure. For
example, in one scene, Dr. Wai tosses two hulking sumo wrestlers up in
the air like volleyballs, then gets on his back, and kicks them (one
with each foot), and the wrestlers go sailing through the air about 40
feet down a warehouse. As the wrestlers are still sailing horizontally,
Dr. Wai gets up, runs after them, and then takes them each by one arm
and throws them a further 20 feet. 
I loved the script to this movie, but I think the adventure scenes are
played a little too stiffly. For example, the wild and unbelievably
exaggerated scenes which were meant to spoof RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK are
played here mostly straightfaced or serious, whereas a little
tongue-in-cheek twinkle of the eye or a Jackie Chan/ Harrison Ford grin
and some big music would have added more smiles.

Title
Review for Game, The (1997)
Starring: Michael Douglas, Sean Penn, Deborah Kara Unger, James Rebhorn
and Anna Katerina 
Written by: John Brancato, Michael Ferris
Ingredients: Mr. Smug unravels mentally, dangerous babe involved, lots
of foreboding darkness, visual artistry.
Synopsis: 
Perhaps because of his father's suicide, Nicholas Van Orton (Michael
Douglas) has grown up to become a San Francisco billionaire who doesn't
value people and thinks nothing of putting them out of business. As a
birthday present from his younger brother Conrad (Sean Penn), a former
mental therapy patient, Van Orton agrees to contact a game-playing
corporation called CRS. He waits for them to start his surprise game, 
but he isn't told what kind of game his brother Conrad has volunteered
him for. Four or five live-threatening situations later Van Orton is a
haggard and penniless bum, and it seems apparent that the game was all
an elaborate ruse involving hundreds of actors in order to steal his
signature, access codes and bank accounts. 
Van Orton gets a gun intending to find out who is behind the game and
get his life back. Just when it seems all the cards are falling into
place and he has their scheme all figured out, the movie throws a
surprise ending at us, which was somewhat foreshadowed by Van Orton's
persistent flashbacks of his father's suicide.
Opinion:
It's slightly annoying not knowing what the game' is and why
omnipresent CRS con men seem to be taking Nicholas Van Orton's life away
until the final scene. But it doesn't matter because it's so fun
watching Michael Douglas not know either, and flail away trying to find
out. The plot keeps you in the dark about what's going on so that you
begin to experience a little of Van Orton's paranoia. Adding to the
murky feeling is the cinematography, which portrays all scenes in
darkness and dim lighting but high detail.
Michael Douglas turns in an excellent performance because he knows just
when to flash his smug I think I know what the heck's going on' smirk
and when to panic like a madman. Deborah Kara Unger provides great
support in the role of Christine, a mysterious waitress who seems to be
Van Orton's only clue to what may be going on. 

Title
Review for Blade (1998)
Ingredients: Vampire society and culture, a half-vampire hero who hunts
vampires, martial arts
Starring: Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe
Wright
Synopsis: 
Accepted by neither vampires nor humans, Eric (Wesley Snipes) is a
half-vampire, born of a human mother who was killed by vampires. He has
the strength of a vampire but the mortality and daylight immunity of a
human. Rejecting his vampire heritage, Eric now goes by the name of
Blade. He survives on serum rather than blood, and hunts vampires for
vengeance, using martial arts skills honed by years of training under
the tutelage of a friend named Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). Blade
slays vampires because he's hoping to find the vampire who killed his
mother. 
In BLADE, Blade makes a moral decision. He saves a hematologist named
Karen (N'Bushe Wright) against his better judgement. She has been bitten
by a vampire, and has only days to cure herself, before turning into a
vampire.
Meanwhile, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff), a megalomaniacal vampire with
minions of thugs, plots to capture Blade and use Blade in an evil occult
ceremony that will increase Frost's powers.
Opinion:
The visual artistry and choreography of BLADE, highlighted by excellent
color and camerawork, is superb. BLADE showcases the Filipino fighting
arts (Kali/Arnis/Escrima). The character Blade keeps his stances deep,
as in karate, begins his sword battles with a two-hand kendo grip, and
then switches to a Filipino stick fighting style as the fighting gets
thick. He also uses the occasional wrist throw or the handstand kick
(found in Brazilian Capoeira). Snipes does his own combat stuntwork, and
possesses a fast-paced eclectic fighting style. His familiarity with
martial arts and his emotional intensity as an actor make Snipes perfect
as Blade.
In BLADE all of the main characters are emotionally intriguing, whether
it is Blade (the vampire hunter who loathes himself for being part
vampire), Karen (the hematologist who learns that she doesn't have long
to live), or Whistler (Blade's human mentor). Even bad guy Frost is more
than just a cardboard cartoon: within the strict vampire society power
structure, he's fomenting a revolution against the older traditionalist
clans. 
One main strength of the movie is its excellent re-interpretation of
vampire society and mythology. The characters act the way they do
because they live in a interesting world. In the BLADE universe a
powerful international vampire society lives quietly and secretly among
oblivious humans. Mafia-style vampire clans are ruled in a hereditary
manner, consisting of born vampires who follow traditional ways. A
faction rebelling against the ancient order consists of non-hereditary
vampires: bloodsucking bite victims who have survived, who are more
attuned to human ways (dance clubs, etc.), and technology. There are
also fanatical human cultists called "familiars." Secret power struggles
and cultural revelations (clan tattoos, hieroglyphics, etc.) make the
complete vampire world of BLADE as least as fascinating as the X-Files
or Star Trek fictional universes.  
My one complaint about BLADE is the comic bookish plot, which is just
OKAY. When you have a movie where your bad guy's master plan is to
"resurrect Amagra the blood red god" it kind of narrows your marketing
audience.
SEQUEL POSSIBILITIES:
A good BLADE sequel should concentrate on three pillars: all-around
character depth, action choreography, and inner moral
conflict/temptation. The action should be plentiful and chaotic, the
gizmos uncomplicated (no batmobiles or remote control mosquitoes), and
the villains should always be emotionally deep and steeped in lore (no
cardboard). This basic formula should then be delivered through a
down-to-earth plot that offers us glimpses of a hidden 'culture' that
entertains and intrigues. 
For example, I like how the ancient and traditionally rigid vampire
hierarchy contrasts starkly with the disorderly, culturally relative
human world in BLADE. Other points of intrigue include: fast-paced
Filipino martial arts; Wesley Snipes' choreography input and acting;
uncovering hidden vampire culture, history, or power struggles, and;
deep or interesting ensemble characters all around, with many points of
internal or external conflict. 
In the sequel there could be several points of dramatic tension, such
as: Blade forging a temporary alliance with someone he hates; Blade
dealing with human weakness, tragedy, or a young child; Blade searching
for his unknown father; clashing with other "day walkers" or vampires
with abilities similar to his own; crossing paths with evil or good
non-vampires such as HIGHLANDER immortals; being approached by someone
with a fatal disease asking to be bitten in order to prolong life;
reacting to tabloid exposure; et cetera. 
For plot improvement I'd suggest a straight-shot, non-complicated plot
that's not too comic book-ish or over-the-top, with a villain that's
deliberately puzzling or enigmatic. The creators of BLADE should also
make sure not to go too high tech. Like the HIGHLANDER, Blade is
essentially a masterless samurai. He may seem to have strange powers
compared to normal humans. But the essence of Blade is that he relies on
martial valor and a personalized code of honor, while the unsuspecting
and pampered humans rely on political expedience, money, technology, and
moral relativity - - this makes the toiling Blade more human than the
humans (and stricter than the vampires).

Review for Celebrity (1998)
Ingredients: Washed up writer, divorce, chasing women
Starring: Kenneth Branagh, Judy Davis, Famke Janssen
Synopsis: 
Lee Simon (Kenneth Branagh) and his wife Robin (Judy Davis) get a
divorce. From that moment, Lee goes chasing around after beautiful young
women in the entertainment business. Meanwhile Lee's wife Robin doesn't
chase anyone at all, but nonetheless captures the heart of a wonderful
man. Leonardo DiCaprio has a small part as a decadent celebrity who
examines one of Lee's writing projects. 
Opinion:
CELEBRITY could have been interesting as a vivacious comedy, but
director Woody Allen plays this one serious and instead gives us a black
and white film about a shallow divorcee who doesn't seem to go anywhere
as he fails one relationship after another.
Woody Allen films are easily recognizable because the characters talk in
self-confessions, as if each dialogue partner is a part-time
psychoanalyst. In CELEBRITY not only do we get the trademark dialogue,
but Kenneth Branagh, playing Lee Simon, is a dead ringer for Woody Allen
himself. Branagh does a masterful job imitating Woody Allen's speech,
mannerisms, and facial ticks. Unfortunately, all this good acting goes
to waste on CELEBRITY's canned script which presents us with nothing we
haven't seen before.
In movies we hope to be uplifted, or at least to be entertained by
something new, something exciting, or something deep - -  as characters
grow, win battles, or come to profound realizations. But in CELEBRITY no
such goals or realizations occur, and filming in black and white doesn't
make the shallow skirt-chasing seem any more insightful. Give us
something more profound.

Review for Prince of Egypt, The (1998)
Directed by: Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner, and Simon Wells
Adapted from the biblical tale in the book of Exodus.
Ingredients: Two brothers, ancient Egypt, Hebrew people escaping slavery
Starring: The voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock, Danny
Glover, Jeff Goldblum, Steve Martin, Helen Mirren, Michelle Pfeiffer,
Martin Short, and Patrick Stewart
Synopsis:
The problem begins when a dominant Egyptian culture enslaves members of
a regional Hebrew immigrant minority as a labor force for public works.
Moses (Val Kilmer), born a Hebrew, is adopted and educated among the
affluent, advanced society of Egypt, the reigning superpower of its
time. After accidentally slaying an Egyptian, Moses returns to the
Hebrews and becomes the founder of a divine anti-slavery movement. A
strategy of deliberate collateral casualties - - through divine
biological warfare (plagues) - - is used to leverage superpower
compliance with the demands for autonomy.
Moses is deeply disturbed because his abolitionist beliefs put him at
odds with his beloved brother Ramses (Ralph Fiennes). When an
opportunity arises for the Egyptian military to retaliate, the two
clashing ethnic groups - - one led by Moses and the opposing group led
by his brother - - meet at the Sea of Reeds for a final showdown.
Opinion:
Despite being a cartoon adapted from a 1500 BC story, the themes of THE
PRINCE OF EGYPT- - an affluent dominant society in terror; collateral
damage to leverage political goals; religious fundamentalist movements;
rejection of superpower culture; families torn apart by issues, and;
mysterious biological warfare - - are relevant, 20th Century dilemmas.
Of the 10 Plagues of Egypt, three are periodic natural disasters (hail,
desert locusts, sandstorms, fire, darkness and tidal waves possibly from
the 1500 BC Santorini volcanic eruption), and the other seven can be
duplicated through dinoflagellates, microbes, germ-carrying insects, and
introducing mycotoxin-producing fungus to food supplies stored in silos
and granaries to create poisoning levels strong enough to kill small
"firstborn" children housed in unmarked areas served by those supplies.
Fortunately for modern times, a strategy of deliberately inflicting
collateral casualties is considered militarily unethical, and most
modern nations have ratified the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons
Convention (BWC) which bans attacking populations with biblical-style
plagues and toxins.
The child-friendly THE PRINCE OF EGYPT is an animated musical that is
mostly about hope and emancipation, along with an interesting new angle
to the familiar tale. Its main dramatic emphasis is on the inner
reluctance Moses feels when his love for his Egyptian royal brother
comes into conflict with his brother's advocacy of morally untenable
slavery. Aside from being a family film, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT is also a
musical event of sorts. In addition to the soundtrack album, two
simultaneous spinoff  CD's are being released: THE PRINCE OF EGYPT -
NASHVILLE, and THE PRINCE OF EGYPT - INSPIRATIONAL.
There are two minor weaknesses to the film: the sound effects, and the
characterization of Moses. Regarding sound, scenes where legions of
frogs erupt out of the water, or where the Reed Sea comes crashing down
upon the Egyptian army have the potential to fill the theater with a
dramatic, living cacophony, but these opportunities go relatively
silent. As for Moses, the character starts out with vitality in the
beginning of the story. But towards the end - - just when he should be
supercharged with passion, faith, leadership, and conviction - - Moses
seems a hesitant, reluctant emissary, relying on his sister Miriam for
moral support.
On the other hand, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT has many strengths. It includes a
beautiful musical score with excellent tunes. Secondly, the voices are
done well. These days animation, which is advancing by technological
leaps and bounds and becoming more popular, often makes better acting
than real life because it is able to free actors and actresses from
burdensome stereotypes created when the audience can see their
appearance. Finally, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT is visually impressive in that
it integrates topnotch cartooning with computer generated effects to
produce a seamless and extraordinary story universe. The parting of the
Reed Sea is particularly impressive.

Title
Review for Blast from the Past (1999)
Written by: Bill Kelly and Hugh Wilson
Starring: Brendan Fraser, Alicia Silverstone, Christopher Walken, Sissy
Spacek, and Dave Foley
Synopsis:
BLAST FROM THE PAST is a romantic comedy that explores what might happen
if a polite, young suitor raised with the boundless idealism and
homespun LEAVE IT TO BEAVER values of early 1960s TV sitcoms falls in
love with a disbelieving 1990s gal.
In 1964 when Mr. and Mrs. Webber (Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek)
mistake a plane crash for an atomic bomb attack, they sequester
themselves in a large underground fallout shelter which is automatically
locked for 35 years. Through their misunderstanding their child Adam is
raised completely oblivious of the world above and all its changes as
the family waits for the "fallout" to clear. When 35-year-old Adam
(Brendan Fraser) at last emerges from the shelter in search of a
possible wife, he may be the only completely innocent gentleman left in
a crowded and raucous, modern world of traffic, adult bookstores, dirt,
and superficial relationships. Adam is literally a BLAST FROM THE PAST.
Luckily he befriends Eve (Alicia Silverstone), who helps him navigate
the new world. Will Adam's un-hip good nature and childlike faith in Eve
prevail in the jaded 1990s?
Opinion:
Brendan Fraser (from GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE) is credible as an awestruck
35-year-old who is still pure and naďve, and Alicia Silverstone as his
love interest displays just the right combination of world-weariness and
heart. Meanwhile Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken as the two old
fashioned parents are able to stay funny and keep a straight face at the
same time.
BLAST FROM THE PAST also has interesting undercurrents. While chuckling
at the real paranoia of the early Cold War, the film resounds with a
bigger theme: earnestness versus cynicism. In the story, years of
accidental isolation have enabled main character Adam to grow up
unspoiled, retaining community and family values amidst a selfish world.
In real life it's not so easy. Isolationist dictatorships can perhaps
hold technological and cultural evolution in stasis, but for the rest of
us, the juggernaut of "progress" seems inevitable. BLAST FROM THE PAST
shows how technology has progressed as expected, but a more humane
society has not.
Sweet, romantic, funny, intelligent. I like it.

Title
Review for Bulworth (1998)
Written by: Warren Beatty and Jeremy Pikser
Starring: Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Oliver Platt
Ingredients: 
Completely honest Senator who says: "If you don't put down that malt
liquor and chicken wings and get behind somebody other than a running
back who stabs his wife, you're never going to get rid of somebody like
me."
Synopsis: 
In this sharp and hilarious comedy which combines madcap farce with
stinging political commentary, old Senator Jay Billington Bulworth
(Warren Beatty) is a pitiful, corrupted former 60s idealist who 'sold
out' to rich special interests, and as a result is engulfed in moral
guilt, shame, sadness and depression. On TV the smiling senator is
ostensibly running a successful re-election campaign, but actually he is
on the verge of a suicidal mental breakdown. After taking his last 10
million dollar insurance bribe, Bulworth arranges to hire an anonymous
contract killer and contracts a hit on himself, to take place sometime
within the next three days. 
To his surprise, Bulworth suddenly finds out that - - now that nothing
matters - - he's at last free to be perfectly honest and candid. He can
say what he actually feels about his job, the American political
process, and real life in America. Elated, Bulworth decides to cancel
his assassination, but to his dismay, he finds out he's unable to get in
contact with the hit man in order to cancel the hit. 
Thus begins the outrageous, loony and slightly paranoid behavior of a
completely honest, politically incorrect senator. For example, Bulworth
tells poor churchgoers that they are little more than photo
opportunities for politicians. When voters accuse him of past misdeeds,
he asks, "Isn't that obvious?"He tells rich movie producers that they
are bilking the American public with greedy, worthless, schlock movies.
Bulworth goes to south central LA and learns to rap, then takes up
wearing a knit cap and baggy shorts and begins to deliver his speeches
in rhymes. 
As Bulworth's unorthodox ravings progress, he tackles life with
increasingly fearless, unrepentant abandon. Refusing to sleep, Bulworth
becomes the incandescent symbol of the discontented average American; as
a result, the American public jumps to his support. He also romances a
mysterious beautiful woman named Nina (Halle Berry).
What will happen to the romance, the campaign, and the hit contract? 
The reason why I say it's a gutsy film is because there will no doubt be
sensitive people who will want to take this movie too seriously. As the
Bulworth character  is completely nuts, outrageously irreverent, and
makes a target of the entire political spectrum, there are bound to be
folks who take offense to the farcical senator's delirious speeches.  
The reason why I say it's hilarious is because BULWORTH is meant to
provide farcical entertainment. Why else would the unshaven senator be
dressed in hip-hop clothing and spouting raps to a grooving soundtrack? 
I highly recommend this film to anybody. You may like it, or you may
hate it, but I guarantee it will not leave you indifferent.

Title
Review for Thirteenth Floor, The (1999)
Synopsis: 
Douglas Hall  (Craig Bierko) has a problem. His best friend, a rich old
computer genius named Hannon Fuller (Armin Mueller-Stahl) has created a
virtual 1937 Los Angeles inside a computer simulation that is so realistic
that the computer characters think they really exist. The problem is that
Fuller has just been murdered, and all the clues point to Hall as the
murderer. Poor Hall can't remember a thing about where he was the night of
the murder despite a bloody shirt. Hall chases down a possible clue inside
the Los Angeles simulation, while trying to prevent the character
simulations from finding out that they are not real. He meets a mysterious
woman (Gretchen Mol) and tries to clear himself while exploring the new
"reality."
Opinion:
The trouble with THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR is that it's a concept movie.
Characters go through long dialogues passing movie minutes until the film's
ending delivers the big "surprise" revelation. Unfortunately, the
revelation is no surprise because this year we've seen similar "reality"
revelations from countless other virtual simulation theme movies such as
THE MATRIX. 
I can recommend the beautifully done cinematography; 1937 Los Angeles is a
visual feast. But there's not enough danger and the end is predictable.
It's hard to pay full attention to THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR for more than half
an hour no matter how wonderfully the visuals are rendered.

Title
Review for Edge, The (1997)
Starring: 
Bart the Bear, Anthony Hopkins, Alec Baldwin, Elle Macpherson. Harold
Perrineau, L.Q. Jones, Kathleen Wilhoite, and David Lindstedt
Interesting note: David Mamet, the writer of this movie, is a renowned
American playwright who was born in Chicago in 1947. Mamet is best known
for slick macho city guy characters and their egos and posturing. He won
a Pulitzer Prize for Glengarry Glen Ross. His films include The
Verdict,' The Untouchables,' The Postman Always Rings Twice,' and
Hoffa.'
Ingredients: 
A bookworm, a sleazeball who covets the bookworm's wife, a plane crash,
lots of Alaskan wilderness, a man-eating bear
Synopsis: 
Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins) is a wealthy but socially awkward
bookworm who suspects his beautiful supermodel wife (Elle Macpherson)
might be having an affair with virile morally bankrupt photographer
Robert Green (Alec Baldwin). From this point on, foreshadowing is the
name of the game. While on a plane, Charles happens to be reading a book
called "How to Survive in the Wilderness." And in the first few minutes
of the movie, the dialogue between various characters covers the fact
that birds can cause a plane to crash, and that bears in Alaska
sometimes stalk human victims.  So from the very start, we can guess
what will happen to a tiny bush plane carrying both Charles and Robert
over Alaska for a photo shoot. The trouble is, Charles' wife and Robert
are far from virtuous. Will Robert take the opportunity to kill off
Charles? Will a bear kill them both? Will they kill the bear? All we in
the audience have to do now is sit back, live theater style, and watch
the actors and the bear hash out their differences.
Opinion:
It seems like every word spoken or every action taken in the beginning
of the 'The Edge' - - no matter how insignificant - -  is foreshadowing
for something that occurs before the movie ends. Not a word is wasted.
Even when Charles receives an engraved timepiece it's really just
foreshadowing for the presenting of an engraved timepiece later on in
the story. This "Murphy's Law" quality, as every single word or action
comes back to haunt, makes the movie seem more tongue-in-cheek. Envision
two men on a park bench acting out a dramatic situation concerning a
wife, and then place the men on a log in the middle of the Alaskan
forest instead. Throw in a few homicidal bear attacks and see how they
get out of each dilemma. 

Title
Review for Small Soldiers (1998)
Written by: Gavin Scott, Adam Rifkin, Ted Elliott, and Terry Rossio
Starring: Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst
Ingredients: 
Toy soldiers that attack parents and children, families under siege 
Synopsis:
When a military-industrial conglomerate swallows Heartland Toy Company,
a bungling toymaker (Jay Mohr) incompetently puts advanced military
computer chips into two groups of toy action figures. The pacifistic toy
extraterrestrial Gorgonites led by Archer (voice of Frank Langella) are
programmed to hide and surrender, while the Commando Elite toy group led
by Chip Hazard (voice of Tommy Lee Jones) are programmed to attack and
kill Gorgonites and their allies. The military chips accidentally give
the toys the ability to think and act like living creatures.
The toys escape into a suburb and wreak havoc. When a boy named Alan
Abernathy (Gregory Smith) befriends Archer and the Gorgonites, the
Commando Elite toy soldiers categorize humans as Gorgonite allies and
mount a lethal attack on Alan's family and the family of next door
neighbor Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), whom Alan has a crush on. The
evil soldiers also insert military chips into Christy's Barbie-type
dolls to turn them into soldiers.
The Fimple and Abernathy families find themselves surrounded by an army
of toys with nail guns, flame throwers, attack helicopters, and buzz
saws. Will they survive and defeat the aggressive hordes of small
soldiers?
Opinion: 
Although SMALL SOLDIERS' marketing tie-ins suggest that it is a
children's movie, the type that little kids (young enough to buy plastic
dolls) would love to attend, it is not. If children under ten actually
did attend the movie, they might wonder about the sporadic profanity and
about all those nude Barbie-doll-types running amok. Or they could mimic
the kid, Alan, who climbs up a telephone pole and shorts a piece of
metal between two live power cables. And they would find that their
beloved doll hero Chip Hazard is actually the bad guy. In short, parents
of young children should be warned that SMALL SOLDIERS is not the type
of material found in TOY STORY, BABE, or 101 DALMATIONS. The glib,
bland, and predictable SMALL SOLDIERS has good special effects, a happy
ending, and preaches a good moral (don't judge a toy by it's cover), but
it is inappropriate for younger children, who should not be watching the
quality of movie where boorish characters make catcalls at nude Barbie
dolls or use cuss words.
A superior toy-horror movie for a wide general audience should be at
moments suspenseful and chilling, but funny and bitingly satirical with
multi-generation appeal. It should contain action for the kids as well
as well-timed, story-related inside pop culture allusions for adults. It
should contain interesting characters, accommodate the audience's gut
sense of justice, deliver a few unexpected twists, and escalate to a
satisfying moral-laden conclusion. 
SMALL SOLDIERS doesn't fall into the superior category because its human
characters lack dimension, the movie is predictable, and its pop
references lose comic impact because they fly thick, but are peripheral,
rather than story-related. On the other hand, special effects and pop
culture trivia fans might be pleased by elements of SMALL SOLDIERS. The
toy effects by JURASSIC PARK's Stan Winston are well done and lifelike.
As for trivia buffs, director Joe Dante serves up a cornucopia of hidden
cultural references. (Example: "You're from Jersey? What exit?") Even
the voices and music refer to previous movies (DIRTY DOZEN, SPINAL TAP
etc.).
On a side note, fans of the late actor/comedian Phil Hartman will enjoy
seeing him in a small role as Mr. Fimple. It was his last movie role.

Title
Review for Chinese Box (1997)
Written by: Jean-Claude Carriere and Larry Gross.
Starring: Jeremy Irons, Gong Li, Maggie Cheung, Ruben Blades
Ingredients: Dying photojournalist, 1997 Hong Kong hand over, street
waif, friend, lover
Synopsis: 
John, a British author who has adopted Hong Kong as his home, suddenly
finds out he is dying of leukemia six months before the hand over of
Hong Kong to China. He quits his job and tries to explore the meaning of
Hong Kong by wandering the streets with a video camera. Since John is a
character of internal feelings and few words, John's roommate Jim (Ruben
Blades) occasionally acts as the movie's mouthpiece.
What is Hong Kong before the hand over? Is Hong Kong like John's lover
Vivian (Gong Li), a Chinese woman who hangs on to him knowing he will
die? Is Hong Kong like the scrappy street waif Jean (Maggie Cheung),
cast off by a former boyfriend, who hustles to survive? Is it like a
business, merely getting a change of management? Or like a defiant
animal in the marketplace? A woman in blue jeans vowing to start life
anew? 
CHINESE BOX explores these metaphorical images and more, and leaves the
answer unresolved, letting us come to our own conclusions. The only
thing we know for sure is that a tumultuous change is occurring before
our eyes, accompanied by an intensity of feeling similar to time spent
with a dying lover. 
Opinion:
When Vivian compares herself to Hong Kong and the dying John (Jeremy
Irons) wonders to himself, "I wonder if I can last as long as  the
British" six months before the 1997 hand over, you can bet this film is
not about leukemia, but a metaphor trying to establish the meaning of
Hong Kong. 
One of the weaknesses of the story is that it has very little story.
After quitting his job a dying John basically wanders around the city
with his video camera capturing images and occasionally falling into
weakness or frustration. His thoughts remain confused until the end of
the movie. This is likely to disappoint fans of strong storylines. 
On the other hand, CHINESE BOX is powerful from the artistic point of
view.  In one scene, John's friend Jim takes a projector, and projects
the videotaped face of the talking street waif onto John's face,
creating an interesting effect. From images of jade and bloody hands to
a man beheading a chicken, to a scene where the street waif confronts a
British childhood boyfriend who abandoned her, CHINESE BOX offers us an
unending stream of metaphors for the complicated feelings that abound in
real life Hong Kong. Perhaps the strongest image (shown twice) is the
close up of the still-beating heart on a faceless chopped fish in the
marketplace. CHINESE BOX is also one of the few films in which the
soundtrack completely and perfectly matches the imagery, whether it's
the sound of traffic or the sound of silence. 
Gong Li doesn't get many lines, (mostly gets to show emotions) but she
does a fabulous job within that limitation. Ruben Blades and Maggie
Cheung are outstanding, and Jeremy Irons puts in a solid
characterization of a man trying to come to grips with complicated
feelings.

Title
Review for American Werewolf in Paris, An (1997)
Ingredients: 
Three young American guys traveling in Paris, cute girl who is a
werewolf by night, a werewolf organization that wants to take over the
world
Synopsis: 
AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS is based on the mythology of an earlier
film: AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON (1981) by John Landis. For those of
you unfamiliar with the AMERICAN WEREWOLF ... formula, the basic
horror/comedy formula for this series is: some young American guys hang
out in Europe to backpack, travel, and meet women. One of them
invariably gets bitten by a werewolf, while another invariably dies. The
spirit of the dead friend is cursed to haunt and give advice to the
surviving friend, who now finds that he transforms into a hairy
man-eating creature at night when the moon is full. AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF
IN LONDON (1981) became an 80s cult classic because of its dark humor
and great special effects transformations. 
AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS does not have great special effects (the
wolf creatures don't have natural movement or balance), but it does
contain elements of the same plot formula as AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN
LONDON. In the first ten minutes, it's established that three immature
American main characters are bumbling around Europe daring each other to
do crazy stunts and meet women. When the geekiest of the travelers - -
Andy (Tom Everett Scott) - - tries to impress his friends with a bungee
jump off the Eiffel Tower, he accidentally ends up saving a hot French
babe named Seraphine (Julie Delpy), who is trying to commit suicide from
the top of the tower. Little do the boys know that Seraphine is really a
werewolf. Soon enough, Andy gets bitten by a werewolf, his buddy dies,
and the spirit of the dead friend is cursed to haunt and give advice to
poor Andy - - who now finds that he transforms into a bloodthirsty beast
at night when the moon is full. The third American buddy is captured by
a gang of anti-American French werewolves who want to take over the
world. Meanwhile Seraphine is doing some research on an antidote to cure
lycanthropy (werewolfism). Can Andy and Seraphine cure themselves and
also stop the militant werewolf group from world domination?
Opinion:
I like werewolf movies in general. I also like the first ten minutes of
AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS; it is kind of funny, and it establishes
that - - aside from the wolf story - - some sort of comedic romance is
going to take place. Finally, I like the end of this movie, because it
ties in with the beginning. But the middle of the film really loses me -
- with a dozen side plots about militants taking over the world, causing
and curing lycanthropy, a mysterious patient on a respirator, a needless
breast-feeling scene, an unresolved female American tourist undead
spirit character, confusing new werewolf lore about eating the heart of
the werewolf that bit you, and so on. I ended up with more questions
than I came in with. In my opinion, they should simplify the middle of
this movie by weeding out unnecessary unresolved subplots and
characters, and then find a way to make it humorous and witty - -
instead of suspenseless and confusing.

Title
Review for Knock Off (1998)
Starring: 
Jean-Claude Van Damme, Rob Schneider, Lela Rochon, Michael Wong, Paul
Sorvino, Carmen Lee, Glen Chin
Synopsis: 
In this Hong Kong comedy Marcus (Van Damme) and his buddy Tommy
(comedian Rob Schneider) are wheeler dealers in freewheeling Hong Kong.
They are V 6 company representatives running a factory for producing V 6
designer jeans for export to the United States, but in KNOCK OFF Hong
Kong is notorious for fake designer goods called knock offs.
One day the boys get a visit from V 6 investigator Karan Leigh (Lela
Rochon), accusing them of producing cheap knock offs instead of the real
jeans. Of course, this being an action comedy, this means that some
anonymous terroristic bad guys are responsible for making the fake jeans
and trying to hide microbombs inside them in a bid for world domination.
Enter the CIA, the Russian Mafia, Hong Kong mobsters, Hong Kong cops Lt.
Han and Ling Ho (Michael Wong and Carmen Lee), and of course, the
high-kicking Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Opinion:
For H.K. movie fans, KNOCK OFF features popular New York born Hong Kong
actor Michael Fitzgerald Wong, and model-turned-actress Carmen Lee. But
the main characters are Belgian kickboxer Jean-Claude Van Damme and
comedian Rob Schneider from TV's MEN BEHAVING BADLY. In this case,
teaming up a martial artist with a comedian for a buddy action comedy is
a good idea, since it takes half of the acting burden off of the martial
artist. Schneider is not a kung fu man or action star, and Van Damme is
better known for slow motion spin kicks, but luckily director Tsui Hark
and his team use judicious cuts and film speed to keep the action up
front and flowing.
Surprisingly, WAITING TO EXHALE actress Lela Rochon, playing company
investigator Karan Leigh, gets to do a decent amount of action work,
kung fu kicks, and machine gun shooting. As an action gal, Rochon
actually does well enough to get my fan vote as the next Bond girl or
Foxy Brown sequel heroine. 
Teaming such an athletic cast of legitimately good actors with DIE HARD
scriptwriter Steven E. de Souza, you'd think KNOCK OFF would be a great
movie. But the bad news is, the plot is somewhat of a disappointment,
the dubbing is evident, and people chase each other around the city
without dramatic tension or character sympathy. If a building blows up,
it doesn't mean anything unless the building is somehow important to the
plot. Or if a character gets chased or bombed, the character should be
someone of significance to the movie, not a stranger. But in Knock Off,
a lot of action goes on without any particular meaning. For example, the
1997 Hong Kong handover is extraneously thrown in, but doesn't have any
significance to the movie.
In Knock OFF not as much attention is paid to the plot as to the
scene-by-scene choreography. When Marcus informs the police so they can
make a big raid on the big Russian Mafia boat, only one lieutenant shows
up to make the raid. Why? Carmen Lee plays another cop who is introduced
early in the movie, but fades away, so we never find out about her
personality or adventures, either. 
Despite plot holes and characters the audience doesn't get to know or
care about, watching cops run around can still mildly entertain. But I'd
wait for the video unless you're a big fan of one of the stars or
choreography.

Title
Review for Playing God (1997)
Starring: David Duchovny, Timothy Hutton, Angelina Jolie
Ingredients: 
washed-up surgeon, software pirate, beautiful moll, 70s-style action
music, bantering 'Pulp Fiction' goons 
Synopsis:
In the opening scene, drug-addicted loser Eugene Sands (David Duchovny)
goes to a bar to score some synthetic heroin, but thugs burst in and
shoot the man next to him. Using a knife, tubing from a beer tap, and a
plastic water bottle, Eugene instinctively drains blood from the
punctured lung of the victim, establishing himself as a gifted former
surgeon. Philosophical insights in the form of voice narration and a
flashback inform us that the talented young Eugene is banned from the
the medical profession due to a stupid mistake: he botched an operation
while under the influence of drugs. During the rest of the movie, Eugene
performs surgery on wounded thugs and meets a series of assorted inept
criminals and bungling FBI agents. Eugene also falls in love with Claire
(Angelina Jolie), the girlfriend of Raymond (Timothy Hutton), a
smalltime software pirate. The end of the movie involves a predictable
car chase between Eugene and Raymond. Will the failed doctor be able to
get his life back on track?
Opinion:
If you are expecting a serious drama, an action extravaganza, or a
suspense flick, 'Playing God' isn't any of these. Try to imagine
Humphrey Bogart as a doctor on the skids making philosophical quips
through voice narration, and you'll get the picture. The Doc's
redemption is the theme, but somehow two-bit software pirates and a
beautiful gangster moll are thrown into the mix, not quite effectively.
The good news is that Angelina Jolie does a fine job as the beautiful
gangster moll. David Duchovny's deadpan wit and boy next door face are
just right for the down and out doctor. Timothy Hutton somehow breathes
needed life into the cardboard character of Raymond the crook. 
The bad news is that the film hasn't much sharpness or dramatic punch.
This is a redemption story about a failed doctor, but though much of the
film time is spent painting a fuzzy background subplot concerning the
plans of Russian, Chinese, and American software pirates, these plans
never get clarified. A scene where Sands is supposed to be undergoing
withdrawal symptoms from trying to kick his drug habit looks like he's
simply snoozing in bed with a lot of nearby chocolates. Small potatoes
villains don't seem very dangerous or threatening, and there are no high
stakes involved if anybody wins or loses. The ending is predictable: a
mediocre car chase. 
Despite this, if you're in the mood to watch a downed but decent doctor
redeem himself, the movie succeeds on the strength of its message.

Title
Review for Gattaca (1997)
Starring: Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Loren Dean, and Alan Arkin
Ingredients: 
Futuristic corporate world where genetics determines promotion,
impersonator who bucks the system, girlfriend, murder 
Synopsis:
In a world which lacks emotion or real relationships, Vincent (Ethan
Hawke), a nearsighted young man with a heart condition, dreams of being
selected for a manned space mission. Unfortunately, Vincent lives in a
futuristic world with a rather cruel social system - - where society is
based completely on DNA testing. The world is robotic, cold fish, and
corporate; well-dressed crowds of people file behind desks in long,
neutral office rooms after going through a series of DNA detection
machines. In order to accomplish his astronaut dream, normal guy Vincent
impersonates someone genetically perfect, since only genetically
enhanced people can get white collar jobs.
As the movie starts, Vincent is only moments from being selected for the
space mission of his dreams. He's wearing a dark suit, and everyone
calls him Jerome. Through a flashback and voice narration Vincent
explains to us that he is not really Jerome. He is an imposter who is
impersonating Jerome. He has risen through the ranks with the help of
the real Jerome (Jude Law), a wheelchair-bound genetically enhanced
person who is bitter at the system. (When an accident left him paralyzed
and no longer elite, Jerome soon found he didn't like the system.) To
spite the system, Vincent and Jerome have joined forces in an elaborate
charade. Vincent has been impersonating Jerome, while Jerome has been
supplying the blood, urine, fingernail and hair clippings, etc. needed
in order to fool DNA testing. If they can manage the charade for just
one more week, Vincent will accomplish his dream of participating in a
manned mission to one of Saturn's moons.
Unfortunately, when one of the directors at Vincent's workplace is
murdered and police are crawling all over the facility, all it takes to
discover Vincent and Jerome's secret is an eyelash, a hair, a touched
door handle, a print on a glass or a bit of saliva in the wrong place.
Soon the innocent Vincent (in his guise as Jerome) is implicated in the
murder, and the charade becomes a matter of life and death. 
How long can they maintain the charade?
This film is a suspenseful, intelligent science fiction piece whose main
theme is impersonation (i.e. the film is not about romance, action, or
solving a murder). The setting of the story is a rather robotic future,
but despite the setting's lack of emotional warmth, it fascinates
because the genetic situation appeals to our real life fear of the
consequences of genetic tampering on society. 
'Gattaca' keeps our attention with good old fashioned suspense, and the
fear that the hero might be discovered at any time is with us all the
away until the final 10 minutes of the movie. A subplot of the film is
Vincent's romance with Irene (Uma Thurman). Here, too, the romantic
element isn't emphasized but serves as another way the charade might be
discovered; the charade makes the movie.
On the negative side, the last 10 minutes of the film include a scene
with a swim contest that doesn't really matter, and an underplayed scene
where Vincent sees a doctor before the movie ends. These last few
minutes could probably be sharpened and improved by cutting out the swim
contest entirely and hyping the suspense music on the doctor scene
before the movie ends. 
I like the movie because of its underlying questions.

Title
Review for 4 Little Girls (1997)
Ingredients: 
black and white photos, interviews with people, tight close-up shots of
faces, Governor George Wallace standing in a school doorway
Synopsis: 
This documentary explores the senseless bombing of the Sixteenth Street
Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama on September 15, 1963 which cut
short the lives of four children attending Sunday school: Addie Mae
Collins (14), Carole Denise McNair (11), Cynthia Wesley (14), and Carole
Rosamond Robertson (14). The bombing was a defining moment in the civil
rights movement because it awakened Americans to the real nature and
ultimate perversity of racist hatred. Interviews with people such as
Walter Cronkite, George Wallace, Coretta Scott King, civil rights
leaders, the former Mayor of Birmingham, and clergy are interspersed
with photos and film clips that locate the Sixteenth Street Baptist
Church within the context of the heated battle for racial integration
which was occurring in Birmingham, Alabama at that time. But the meat of
the story is the memories of the friends and family of the four slain
girls. They're all older now, and we get to watch them during the
interviews as they think back and explain things. Of course some details
are crystal clear and forever remembered, while others are fuzzy or lost
in time. At one point a mother stops and shows us her daughter's doll
collection, which she has faithfully kept pristine for over thirty
years. Another person says with difficulty, "It's not easy. Because we
had put so much of this behind us."
Opinion:
In some documentaries history is examined without emotion as if it
happened in limbo to people we don't know - - to people who wear black
and white clothing on grainy film. Not in this documentary. In '4 Little
Girls' Spike Lee foregoes dramatization or chronology and instead opts
to do this material as a set of interviews showing the plain and simple
(or even contradictory) truth the way people remember it. As real flesh
and blood folks ramble on about the people and events of Birmingham in
the 1960s, the camera allows us to watch every unconscious tick of the
muscles on their faces - - including the parents' and siblings'
determined efforts to keep a stiff upper lip and hold back tears.
Through this documentary Spike Lee reminds us that history is neither
impartial nor located in the past. History is today, living life as we
live it.

Title
Review for Limbo (1999)
Starring: Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, David Strathairn, and Vanessa Martinez
Synopsis: 
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is lounge singer Donna De Angelo. Vanessa
Martinez is Donna's teenage daughter Noelle. David Strathairn plays Joe
Gastineau, a handyman who was once a fisherman. They all live in a seaside
town in Alaska, and they all have issues. Donna has survived a string of
failed relationships and her career as a singer hasn't panned out. Noelle
is profoundly unhappy. Joe feels responsible for a boating accident years
ago. The three of them take a boat ride up the Alaskan coast and end up
stranded together on an inhospitable, deserted island. 
Opinion:
Some movies are all about action and effects. A beautiful, high-maintenance
cast of stereotypical characters goes through a prefab movie formula to
entertain us with big budget bangs and booms and give us manufactured warm
and fuzzy feelings. Other, smaller budget movies are more like the small
theater experience. The plot allows the audience to develop empathy with an
ensemble of less than perfect characters. Then the characters are put in a
tight situation or place and all their issues come out. A lesson is learned
or an aspect highlighted.
LIMBO is more like the latter than the former. I'd like to see a theater
version of it someday. Characters in LIMBO behave the way real people might
act. They're not superheroic. They're not overly dramatic, overly
successful, stereotypical, or even glamorous. Everyone stays in character
even when life throws a bunch of dangerous and unexpected curve balls. And
there's no formula to this movie. 
To tell the truth, the editing seems a little choppy in the last part, and
the movie's finale is a complete surprise. But it's good that way. In life
some of the most profound events, friendships, or forks in the road occur
in an unannounced way, sometimes not even recognized or noticed till years
later. LIMBO is sort of like that. Characters make life-changing decisions
and never even realize that they are making decisions. That's the beauty of
this movie.

Title
Review for Six Days Seven Nights (1998)
Starring: Harrison Ford, Harrison Ford, David Schwimmer, Jacqueline
Obradors
Ingredients: Boyish old island rascal, young female magazine exec, true
love
Synopsis: 
In this romantic comedy, a spunky, career-oriented gal named Robin (Anne
Heche) and her nerdy boyfriend Frank (David Schwimmer), decide to take a
vacation to a remote tropical island in French Polynesia. Harrison Ford
plays Quinn, a divorced exec who has gotten rid of his business and now
lives a simple life as an island bush pilot. 
When a business emergency requires that Robin fly off the island, she
hires Quinn, but the two get stranded alone on a deserted island when
their plane is damaged in flight. To make matters worse, they are
attacked by pirates. On the bright side, they are falling in love. 
Can a 56-year-old islander and a 28-year-old yuppie get along, much less
fall in love?
Opinion:
Usually in the summer, we expect to see a Harrison Ford adventure movie.
But SIX DAYS, SEVEN NIGHTS is not an adventure movie; it's a fluffy,
lighthearted, romantic comedy reminiscent of camping. 
Imagine the kind of situations you'd put in a comedy involving two
people on a funny camping trip: running around lost with maps in hand;
equipment that doesn't work; bad luck weather; a situation involving a
snake; grass skirts from GILLIGAN'S ISLAND; falling from great heights
and plopping down safely in water. It's all there in SIX DAYS, SEVEN
NIGHTS. The movie even throws in a lost World War II plane. While not
meant to be realistic or even remotely original, it's all an excuse to
show how a man and a woman might quibble and argue their way into
falling in love. 
So the only important question is, do Harrison Ford and Anne Heche have
the chemistry for it? He's country; she's city. He's island; she's
mainland. He's laid back; she's a go getter. He's 56; she's 28. Do
opposites attract? In the movies they do. Ford and Heche deliver.

Review for Waterboy, The (1998)
Written by: Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler
Starring: Adam Sandler, Henry Winkler, Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk
Ingredients: 31-year-old Louisiana bayou mama's boy, football 
Synopsis: 
In HAPPY GILMORE (1996) written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, Adam
Sandler plays a loser raised by his loving grandmother, who learns to
channel his aggression into golfing prowess, and becomes an instant
sensation. The subplot involved a love interest and a big important
game. 
In THE WATERBOY (1998) written by Tim Herlihy and Adam Sandler, Adam
Sandler plays a loser named Bobby, raised by his loving mother, who
learns to channel his aggression into football prowess, and becomes an
instant sensation. The subplot involved a love interest and a big
important game.
Opinion: 
Call it the Forrest Gump factor. Underdog Bobby Boucher has a
prounounced southern accent and the formidable intelligence quotient of
a box turtle, but he also possesses a kind heart and a steadfast
devotion to Mama (Kathy Bates, parodying a hillbilly). Of course, Bobby
the Kindhearted makes it to the big time, has a crisis of confidence,
and plays a high stakes finale. Sure, THE WATERBOY is as original as
ROCKY V, and annoyingly predictable, but we're suckers when it comes to
rooting for the underdog till we get sick of the sequels.

Title
Review for Jackal, The (1997)
Starring: Bruce Willis, Diane Venora, Richard Gere, Sidney Poitier
Synopsis:
A hit man who goes by the name of Jackal' (Bruce Willis) is hired to
kill a politician who is to make a speech from a podium in front of a
hospital. Instead of staking out a sniper position on a nearby building,
Jackal gets fancy. He flies to Quebec and purchases a giant Gatling gun
(a swiveling machine gun with several barrels that can fire thousands of
rounds a minute). Of course, as a foundation for the gun, he purchases a
super strong metal alloy stand and a minivan, plus special expensive
uranium bullets and a remote control computer device that enables him to
use his ball-point pen as a joystick. He also sprays special poison on
the door of the van in case anyone tries to get in. Finally, Jackal
purchases a yacht so he can sail the Gatling gun into the United States
undetected. Typical of the logic the authorities use to catch the Jackal
are statements like: "There's a 3000 mile border between Canada and the
US. The criminal could be anywhere! Hmm. Why don't we try checking the
Chicago Yacht Club?" So they send 30 agents to the yacht club, and sure
enough, there's the Jackal, and a gun battle ensues. Will the
authorities catch Jackal before he commits murder?
Opinion:
The writing often makes or breaks a movie. Good movies are able to
ensnare you in the plot, until you're on the edge of your seat and
committed to seeing the movie through to its conclusion. Not-so-good
movies consist of two or three action-packed scenes introduced by
irrational jumps in logic and connected by long stretches of pointless
wandering around. In The Jackal' the talents of stars Poitier, Willis,
and Gere, and Venora are not enough to rescue a poorly written script,
although the two or three action scenes are good, if you can wait around
long enough for them.

Title
Review for T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous (1998)
Ingredients: Young girl ignored by her father, daydreaming, dinosaurs,
meteor shower, 3-D vistas, landscapes, effects
Synopsis:
In this 3-D (IMAX) film, a girl named Ally (Liz Stauber) is ignored by
her paleontologist father Dr. Hayden (Peter Horton) who works at a
dinosaur museum. One day, she visits him while he is working after
hours. Ally gets lost in the big museum and has daydreams in which she
sees real dinosaurs and meets up with historical figures in dinosaur
research who encourage her to form her own theories.
Opinion:
Kids under 5 might find big animals too scary, and kids over 13 might
not identify with the main character, but children of grade school age
will probably like T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS because the movie's
gigantic dinosaurs and breathtaking landscapes really come alive with
the 3-D effects and huge screen. It's a good chance for a family outing.
No, this isn't one of those action packed Jurassic Park sequels where
hapless folks get chomped and stomped by oversized forbears of modern
birds. T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS is a children's educational flick.
The plot is more like the kind you see on public television afterschool
specials where some kid has wonderful imaginary adventures and learns a
lot, too. The theme music can be a bit repetitive, and the fragmented
daydreams don't offer much suspense, but for its young educational crowd
T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS is satisfying enough.
In general 3-D movie-making has a lot of untapped potential, despite
idiosyncrasies. On the negative side, directors can't do as many
fade-ins and fade-outs because it would make the audience too dizzy, and
so you would have to do the whole film with only a few main locations.
But on the plus side, 3-D would be an ideal medium for suspense films.
Headphones are used by the audience members, so the music and targeted
sound effects can be very sophisticated. And instead of using weird
camera angles (a la Alfred Hitchcock) you can create instant suspense by
showing the stalker's point of view, as he crawls around 3-D objects and
the music ratchets up the tension. Not to mention how in 3-D a direct
attack jumps right out at you. Given the targeted music and visual
angles, imagine how terrifying SILENCE OF THE LAMBS might be, especially
the scene where Jody Foster navigates the dark room where the killer is
stalking her. At any rate, advances in 3-D movie-making are something to
look out for in the future.

Review for Trick (1999)
Starring: Christian Campbell, John Paul Pitoc, and Tori Spelling
Synopsis: 
A nebbish homosexual attracts the affection of a buff and studly go-go boy,
and you know the rest of the story from watching other screen romances. Boy
meets boy. Boy loses boy. Guess what's next? 
Opinion:
Since we all know the romance formula, the way to keep it spicy is to
change the setting. Put the romance on a sinking luxury liner, or set it
during the Vietnam War, colonial America, ancient Egypt, a trauma center, a
cop station, a train ride through Europe and so on. That way when the movie
is not concentrating on the inevitable romance, there are interesting and
dangerous subplots or fascinating scenery. 
TRICK neglects this lesson. It has a predictable romance. Outside of the
romance story, we get to hear a lot of side characters complain about not
being able to break into showbiz. But their complaints never get resolved.

Title
Review for Scream 2 (1997)
Starring: 
Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Laurie Metcalf, Jerry
O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Liev Schreiber
Ingredients: 
Slasher at large. Whodunit mystery that spoofs the horror genre. Young,
hip, heroes who spout pop culture witticisms.
Synopsis: 
This fun movie is the sequel to SCREAM (1996), a gore spoof and slasher
parody which pitted heroes Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David
Arquette against an anonymous, masked movie enthusiast/marauder whose
murderous style was based on horror genre cliches. Since SCREAM 2 picks
up where the original SCREAM left off, let's take a moment to remember
the original. In SCREAM the running gag is that the mysterious masked
killer always follows film cliches, but luckily the killer's prey are
movie buffs who try to predict the killer's next move based on the same
cliches. High school girl Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is stalked by
the movie enthusiast/killer. But she turns the tables, and tries to
solve the mystery of her masked stalker's identity. Also in on the hunt
is sleazy, catty, tabloid reporter Gail Weathers (Courteney Cox), and
lawman Deputy Dewey Riley, (David Arquette) a baby-faced, inept
investigator. In SCREAM 2, Director Wes Craven and Writer Kevin
Williamson team up again to create another whodunit that follows the
further adventures of hapless SCREAM characters Sidney, Gail, and Dewey.
This time, Sidney is a theater student in a college town when a series
of SCREAM copycat murders occurs. Sidney becomes the next most probable
victim. Soon enough she is joined by reporter Gail and friend Dewey, and
they all try to figure who the new masked slasher is. The problem is,
people keep conveniently arriving just as the masked attacker leaves, or
leaving just before the killer appears, making everyone a possible
suspect. Sidney and friends trade hip and witty barbs about movie and
pop culture trivia as they wrack their brains trying to figure out the
killer's pattern. Who is the slasher really? The boyfriend? Another film
student? Gail, Dewey, Sidney, the roommate, the sorority girls, the
cops, the recently released jailbird, or an unknown wacko? Find out. 
Opinion:
The thing about any sequel is the question: "Is it as good as the
original?" In this case the answer is yes. If you liked SCREAM, then
chances are, youll think that SCREAM 2 is at least in the same
ballpark. One thing I like about SCREAM 2 is that it spends some time
developing the characters from SCREAM so that you come to know more
about them and like them. If you intend to see this movie, I highly
advise seeing SCREAM (on video) first, because SCREAM 2 assumes that you
remember all the characters and events of SCREAM. It can get slightly
confusing if youre not up on the original story. Here's an example: In
the original SCREAM, one of the characters talks about a movie being
made. "I see myself as sort of a young Meg Ryan. But with my luck, I'll
get Tori Spelling." In SCREAM 2, sure enough, the characters are
watching a movie called STAB, based on the events of SCREAM. Tori
Spelling plays the STAB actress!

Title
Review for G.I. Jane (1997)
Starring: Demi Moore, Anne Bancroft, Viggo Mortensen
Director: Ridley Scott
Synopsis: Test case Jordan O'neill (Demi Moore), eyes glaring beneath
her military crew cut, must survive rigorous basic training for the US
Navy Seals, an elite special forces division because if she makes it,
the military might rewrite its guidelines restricting women in the armed
forces. O-neill (Demi) deals with discrimination from the men, a cruel
instructor (Viggo Mortensen), and questionable politics by Senator
DeHaven (Anne Bancroft). The film consists mostly of training scenes of
recruits doing grueling exercise and of course one obligatory ending
scene where an emergency forces the recruits to use their skills in real
life. Take a guess. Will Demi pass this macho training with flying
colors and earn the respect of her seemingly cruel commander so that the
credits can roll? 
Opinion: Director Ridley Scott, who directed Sigourney Weaver in that
Alien movie with the space marines definitely has a flair for creating
strong female characters amidst gung ho military boys. If you can
stomach watching 40 minutes of pushups and situps and a pre-fab action
ending, you'll love this film. If not, you'll probably feel that it was
still an okay film, Demi Moore does a great  job acting, but they can
lop off 20 minutes worth of exercise film no problem. The moral of this
movie is: never give up.

Title
Review for Hard Rain (1998)
Starring: Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman, Randy Quaid, Minnie Driver,
Ed Asner 
Ingredients: 
Pouring rain, small flooded town, damn about to burst, bad guys going
after millions of dollars
Synopsis: 
At one point in the story townsperson Karen asks hero Tom what happened
to her church. He replies something like: "The church is flooded but at
least the floodwaters put out the big fire. Well, the fire wasn't that
bad, since, while the church was burning, looters apparently thought it
was safe enough to break through all the priceless stained glass
windows."
In HARD RAIN a small town is nearly deserted due to flooding. Everyone
has had to evacuate because it's raining, and now floodwaters are rising
so high that buildings are being submerged and the nearby dam is about
to break. Enter a working class smart-alecky new armored car driver
named Tom (Christian Slater). Suddenly his security truck carrying over
three million dollars gets stuck on the flooded street and is waylaid by
armed looters. Tom has no choice but to grab the bag full of money, hide
it, and swim for his life. This makes for an action movie full of jet
skis, speedboat chases, and gun battles, as Tom tries to evade and
outsmart corrupt cops and armed looters until the National Guard can
answer his distress call. He is befriended and aided by a spunky
churchgoing young woman from town named Karen (Minnie Driver). But
unknown to Tom and Karen, the National Guard never heard Tom's initial
distress call. Will Tom and Karen survive the natural and manmade
disasters?
Opinion:
Don't expect thought-provoking issues or dramatics. There's not much
more to this movie than hiding, running, swimming, shooting, and saving
handcuffed heroes from drowning, but that's what makes it escapist and
fun. Relax, take your shoes off, and break out the popcorn.

Title
Review for Object of My Affection, The (1998)
Written by: Wendy Wasserstein, from a novel by Stephen McCauley
Ingredients: Unsatisfying relationships, pregnant woman, gay man 
Synopsis:
A young woman named Nina (Jennifer Aniston) is the fiancee of Vince
(John Pankow). Meanwhile across town a young homosexual named George
(Paul Rudd) is the lover of Joley (Tim Daly). But these are largely
superficial, sexual relationships. One day at a party, Nina is attracted
to George. When she learns that George needs a room, she invites him to
share a two-bedroom apartment with her. Gay George breaks up with his
boyfriend and moves in with heterosexual Nina.
Soon enough, Nina and George are blowing kisses at each other, and
spending the night draped in each other's arms watching TV. When Nina
gets pregnant, she announces to the father, Vince (paraphrased): "It's
MY baby. I don't care if you're the father; I want you out of our lives
so that George can raise the baby." 
Vince agrees to stay away. Then Nina tries her best to turn George into
a heterosexual, despite his orientation. Will she succeed?
Opinion:
I watched Jennifer Aniston in PICTURE PERFECT. She gets to do more
acting as Nina in THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION, but as a fan, I'd actually
like to see Jen break out of the romance genre, and do an
out-of-character role like Mira Sorvino's in REPLACEMENT KILLERS or Matt
LeBlanc's Don West in LOST IN SPACE.
The intention of THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION is to give the audience the
message that, "Sometimes in life events compel things beyond our
control, and we must make the best of it, and isn't it surprising how
life turns out after all these years?"  
The problem is, Nina and George seem very much in control and not
propelled by events, so the 'forces beyond our control' theme doesn't
really work for THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION.
Nina, who already has a steady beau, meets complete stranger George at a
party, and asks him to live with her, no questions asked. Why would she
ask a stranger to move in without checking him out, if no normal person
would? The next day Nina signs George up to be her permanent dance
partner. What is she thinking?
Similarly, it's hard to see how a decidedly gay man with the honesty of
George could kiss Nina repeatedly on the lips, allow Nina to fondle him,
sleep in the same bed with her, let her unbutton his shirt, unzip his
fly, lick his abdomen, and pretend he's not leading her on. She's just
about to give him oral sex; why isn't he telling her he's gay? What's
his big secret?  
THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION tries to be a light comedy, but the
characters and events are painful and thought-provoking. In THE OBJECT
OF MY AFFECTION, Nina and George are apparently complicated people
deliberately doing things that don't make any sense or might hurt, but
the film tries to brush it off.
I wouldn't mind seeing a re-make of THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION. When
characters are as deep as L.A. CONFIDENTIAL or THE ICE STORM, why not go
for it, and go deep?

Title
Review for Shakespeare in Love (1998)
Written by: Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard
Ingredients: Shakespeare, Lady dressing like man,
Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, Joseph Fiennes, Judi Dench
Synopsis:
The setting is Old England, in days when only men are allowed to be
actors. Even women's roles are acted by men. A girl named Viola (Gwyneth
Paltrow) wants to become a thespian so badly that she dresses up like a
man and calls herself Mr. Kent in order to audition for Will
Shakespeare's acting troupe.
Meanwhile, separated from his wife and two children, Will Shakespeare
(Joseph Fiennes) can't seem to find inspiration for writing his play
Romeo and Juliet without being in love. He falls in love with Viola not
knowing she is Kent. Viola loves Will in return, but then Viola's father
commands her to become the fiancee of Lord Wessex.
Will love prevail? Will Romeo and Juliet ever be completed and
performed?
Opinion:
A movie where everyone speaks Old English, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE is a
farcical, high energy situation comedy with as many pratfalls and quirky
characters as any SEINFELD or SPIN CITY episode. Gwyneth Paltrow excels
as the scheming heroine who must always stay one step ahead of others in
order to maintain her well-meaning deceptions. Viola's schemes, along
with the joyous sword fighting and swinging around, make SHAKESPEARE IN
LOVE a lighthearted and fun romp.

Title
Review for Sphere (1998)
Written by: Kurt Wimmer, Stephan Hauser, Paul Attanasio (adapted from
the Michael Crichton novel) 
Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Sharon Stone, Samuel L. Jackson, Peter Coyote,
Liev Schreiber
Synopsis: 
Psychologist Norman (Dustin Hoffman), biologist Beth (Sharon Stone),
mathematics whiz Harry (Samuel L. Jackson), astrophysicist Ted (Liev
Schreiber), and navy guy Barnes (Peter Coyote) are commissioned to stay
in an underwater research lab and explore a newly discovered giant space
shuttle that appears to have been sitting under the ocean for the last
300 years. Inside the craft the teams finds a gigantic mysterious golden
'sphere.' 
Without warning, communications with the surface get cut off, while a
mysterious entity takes over the computer and prints cryptic messages
onto the screen. Then the nightmares of the team's members
systematically get turned into physical reality. For instance, phobias
about giant killer squids, sea snakes, and jellyfish come true. (Queen
Latifah plays a navy crewman aboard the research lab, who is the first
to feel the wrath of the killer jellyfish.) Will Norman and the team
figure out who is killing whom before they all die underwater, or will
they sit around and passively wait for events to happen?
Opinion:
There are good actors and actresses in this film, as well as some
special effects, but the story itself is disappointing. The main problem
with this movie is passive characters. 
The characters aren't given any motivations or agendas. In a regular
movie, any character has a goal, the movie tosses in a dilemma, and the
character must overcome the dilemma during the course of the movie. But
in this movie, the team doesn't really 'do' anything. The characters
just lay around and passively wait for events to happen; they never even
take the offensive and counterattack. We the audience don't really care
what happens to the team because we don't know what their goals are, and
in what way the 'sphere' opposes them. At least two the main characters
visit inside the sphere and refuse to reveal any information about what
they saw. But throughout the film, and even at the end of the movie,
they never reveal why they acted that way, or what they had seen inside
the sphere, and why it was such a big secret. For the audience, all of
this adds up to an intuitive feeling of a contrived situation. 
At unexpected times the music gets overly big and intense, and various
team members tell a lie or act insane - - but again, for no explainable
reason. We don't find out - - not even in the end - - who sent the
sphere, why it was sent, what exactly it is, and what its capabilities
are. Nor do we learn anything new about the team's members, even the
ones who acted strangely.

Review for Senseless (1998)

awarded a junior analyst position at Smith-Bytes, a prestigious Wall
Street firm. The problem is, the only people who ever win are rich kids
with upper class connections and prestigious positions in fraternities
and school sports. Meanwhile, poor Darryl is in debt and working himself
broke trying to send money back home to support his destitute,
fatherless family. He has no chance of becoming a contest finalist.
As yet another way to make money Darryl volunteers himself as a human
guinea pig to take an experimental drug, and suddenly finds that his
five senses are ten times as powerful as before. Thus empowered he joins
a fraternity, romances the girl of his dreams Janice (Tamara Taylor),
conquers the hockey team, works his way into the good graces of some
Smith-Bytes execs, and becomes a contest finalist. But tragedy strikes
when Darryl gets power hungry and double doses himself; his five sense
start disappearing.
Can the newly humbled Darryl win the contest, save his family, and win
back the favor of his girlfriend using his own power without the help of
the wonder drug?
Opinion:
In 1984 comedian Steve Martin did a comedy film called ALL OF ME (1984),
in which the spirit of a woman  took possession of one half of Martin's
body. ALL OF ME was a great excuse to highlight Martin's physical comedy
in the form of pratfalls and exaggerated clumsiness. Martin was
different from Robin Williams - - another premier comedian of the 1980s
- -  in that Martin was mostly 'goofy physical' while Williams excelled
in manic, mile-a-minute monologues.
In the 1990s we see a similar comedic dichotomy. On the one hand we have
the fast talking Jim Carrey or Chris Rock while on the other hand there
is Marlon Wayans, an expert trip and fall guy. Wayans' SENSELESS is
similar to Martin's ALL OF ME in that SENSELESS is a very funny comedy
about a guy losing control of his body - - and the film gives physical
comedian Marlon Wayans a great vehicle for comedic falls, slobbery
facial expressions, and general goofiness. If you can imagine Steve
Martin or Jerry Lewis' ability to trip and fall, combined with zany
facial expressions and Eddie Murphy-like enthusiasm, then you have a
good idea of Wayans' comedic charm. 
My only complaint is that one scene in SENSELESS - - the scene where
Darryl tries to have sex with Janice's sorority sister - - doesn't match
Darryl's ethical character or fit in with the rest of the movie. But
there are also very good scenes. One of my favorites is where Darryl
tests out his super senses playing ice hockey for the college team and
becomes a 'kung fu' goalie.
SENSELESS is funny. Director Penelope Spheeris (who also directed
WAYNE'S WORLD) hits the funny bone yet again with this one.

Review for He Got Game (1998)
Starring: Denzel Washington, Ray Allen, Rosario Dawson, Milla Jovovich,
Hill Harper
Ingredients: 
High school basketball player, father out of prison, temptation, trying
to reconnect with children. father/son relationship
Synopsis: 
Jesus Shuttlesworth (NBA Milwaukee Bucks star Ray Allen) is a lonely
high school basketball star who has never forgiven his father for the
accidental killing of his mother during an argument long ago. His
well-meaning father Jake Shuttlesworth (Denzel Washington) pressured
Jesus from birth to become a great ball player, alienating the child
through incessant, demanding training, before being jailed for the
murder and carted away. 
Years later the talented Jesus is about to graduate from high school,
and everyone in the world is out to exploit the kid's talent, from
college recruiters offering unofficial hookers, to agents offering
sports cars, fame, and the fast life. Even his girlfriend, uncle, and
coach cannot be trusted. Everyone wants to use Jesus as a vehicle for
self-enrichment. Jesus faces temptation and the risk of exploitation at
every turn.
One day the governor offers Jake the chance to get out of prison early
if he convinces Jesus to enroll at the governor's alma mater. He gives
Jake one week of supervised freedom to make it happen or go back to
jail. Jake knows it's exploitation, but this is the only opportunity for
him to try to reconnect with his alienated son. He takes the deal. 
A subplot involves Milla Jovovich as a jaded prostitute whom Jake
discovers in a seedy motel, and tries to aid.
Opinion: 
HE GOT GAME is not a sports action vehicle; it's a father/son film, a
good solid project by director Spike Lee. It's not often that we
moviegoers get to see a film about love (other than the lusty romantic
sort), but HE GOT GAME is about a father and son trying to reconnect,
and their love must break tough barriers. 
At the same time, another major theme of HE GOT GAME is exploitation. In
our society it is sometimes assumed that Hollywood and sports
celebrities who accumulate material wealth and fame have "got it made"
and are happy. But in HE GOT GAME the only love that counts is the one
that's real. To other people Jesus seems on the brink of stardom and
happiness, but Jesus may actually be on the brink of unhappiness - - of
discovering how much trusted people are using him for their own greedy
purposes. 
HE GOT GAME is part of an overall trend in 1990s film - - of the
emerging theme of the awareness of mass manipulation. In SCREAM the
movie characters know they are part of a film. In THE GAME and in DARK
CITY we see an overall theme of manipulation by unseen hands.  Next
month in Jim Carrey's THE TRUMAN SHOW (which is similar to DARK CITY
only it should be called BRIGHT CITY) we will again get to ponder the
theme of Hollywood manipulators manipulating characters and situations
like puppets for commercial gain. It's almost as if these days film is
looking inwards on its exploitive, voyeuristic, and commercialist
aspect. In HE GOT GAME, the glitz and glamour of stardom is shown to be
an empty, friendless "tears-of-a-clown" world - - a mind game where
greedy people manipulate each other for money. I predict this
interpretation will sharpen and continue in other films this year.
There are a few minor things that could have been done a little stronger
in HE GOT GAME: The music used Americana and fiddle in some parts of the
film but rap in other parts, whereas it might have been stronger if the
music was a consistent style. There also seem to be two distinct endings
to the film (a real ending followed by another, symbolic, ending) rather
than one. Finally, when Big Time Willie (a small time crook) rides Jesus
around in his convertible and gives him a long-winded rundown on the
various temptations of the inner city, Willie's speech seems contrived
for the audience rather than for Jesus. These three things could have
been sharper, but are still done sufficiently well.
For you basketball fans out there, there are also some interesting
cameos by familiar NBA faces: Shaq, Jordan, Pippen, Reggie Miller, and
coaches Rick Pitino (Celtics) and George Karl (Sonics). 
There is solid acting and cinematography in HE GOT GAME, and it delivers
an articulate viewpoint on our family values and on our society's
values. As Malone of the NBA's Utah Jazz would say, HE GOT GAME
delivers. 

Title
Review for Hilary and Jackie (1998)
Written by: Frank Cottrell-Boyce, adapted from a book by Hilary and
Piers du Pre
Ingredients: sisters, cello, psychological problems
Starring: Rachel Griffiths, Emily Watson
Synopsis:
Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jackie (Emily Watson) are two musical
sisters, but HILARY AND JACKIE is mostly about Jackie because it is
based on the real life of extraordinary cellist Jacqueline du Pre. In
the story, cello genius Jackie has mental problems. On the one hand she
maintains an intensely jealous psychological rivalry against her sister
Hilary. On the other hand, Jackie shares an overpowering bond of
sisterly love with Hilary. This leads to bizarre escapades such as
Jackie's trying to share Hilary's husband, and trying to destroy a
priceless cello by freezing it in cold weather. Will everything turn out
all right for the troubled cellist?
Opinion:
There are two ways to take this story. On the one hand, if you walk into
the film blind, the cinematic style is troublesome. The plot wanders
unfocused until an emotional ending puts up a syrupy "that's life"
theme. On the other hand, if you're a big cello fan, interested in the
material, and are familiar with the story of the brilliant Jacqueline du
Pre, then you could become intrigued by the enigmatic, factual element
of du Pre's tragic life. Emily Watson gives a solid performance as the
beloved cellist.

Title
Review for Zero Effect (1998)
Starring: Bill Pullman, Ben Stiller, Ryan O'Neal, Kim Dickens
Ingredients: 
Eccentric private detective, millionaire client, beautiful blackmailer, 
Synopsis: 
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote four novels and later five books of short
stories concerning the exploits of fictional super-detective Sherlock
Holmes and his faithful sidekick Dr. Watson. Surprisingly, in the
stories Sherlock Holmes uses both morphine and cocaine, which are both
over-the-counter legal drugs at the time. ZERO EFFECT is based on A
SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA, a short story which can be found in the book THE
ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES.
In A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA, Sherlock Holmes initially belittles the
intelligence of women and abhors romantic attraction:  "all emotions,
and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise, but
admirably balanced mind. He was the most perfect reasoning and observing
machine that the world has ever seen, but as a lover....He never spoke
of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer." 
A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA begins with formerly inseparable pals Holmes and
Watson growing apart due to Watson's recent marriage. Holmes is a
violin-playing druggie, "alternating from week to week between cocaine
and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his
own keen nature." 
A rich and powerful king named Wilhelm has committed (sexual)
indiscretions, and a beautiful American woman named Irene Adler has the
photographic evidence. Fearing future blackmail, the king launches a
preemptive strike; he hires a bunch of thugs to harass Irene and
burglarize her home. But they fail to locate the incriminating photo,
and the king ends up hiring Holmes to steal the photo from Irene. 
Holmes dons a disguise and Irene takes him in, thinking he is a kind
gentleman. But once she figures out Holmes' identity Irene flees,
informing Holmes by mail that the real thug is King Wilhelm, since he's
the one harassing her in order to wipe out all knowledge and evidence of
his dirty deeds. Humbled and outsmarted by the end of the story, Holmes
adopts a new respect for women. Watson notices, "And whenever he
[Holmes] speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it
is always under the honorable title of the woman."
Similarly, ZERO EFFECT begins with formerly inseparable ace detective
Darryl Zero (Bill Pullman) and his sidekick Arlo (Ben Stiller) growing
apart due to Arlo's fiancee and recent marriage proposal. Darryl Zero is
a guitar-playing thirty-something, strung-out surfer dude detective,
alternating between amphetamines and deductive brilliance. Somewhat of a
writer, Zero writes about his own effect on people: the "Zero" effect is
when Darryl Zero's observations and interventions change the outlook of
a client. 
Their client, a rich and powerful Portland tycoon named Stark (Ryan
O'Neal) , fears blackmail. Stark has committed a crime, and a beautiful
lady paramedic named Gloria (Kim Dickens) has the incriminating
evidence. Frustrated, Stark hires Zero. 
Zero poses as an accountant and Gloria takes him into her home, sparking
a romance which catches the romantically challenged Zero by surprise.
Eventually she figures out he is Darryl Zero and flees. Of course, the
real thug is Stark, since his ultimate plan is to kill her in order to
wipe out all knowledge and evidence of his crime. Wiser at the end of
the story, Zero notes that Gloria did the "Zero Effect" on him. In other
words Gloria's observations and intervention in Darryl's life
permanently changed him.
Opinion:
ZERO EFFECT is the directorial debut of Jake Kasdan, son of Lawrence
Kasdan, a writer-director. It is a solid detective movie with
interesting twists. In the beginning the main characters seem somewhat
stiff and loony. For example, Bill Pullman goes overboard in an early
drugged-out guitar playing scene while Ben Stiller is as stiff and
straight as a DRAGNET cop. But soon - - as the characters begin to take
on life and actions - -  they develop a kind of depth. By the middle of
the film, you have genuinely entertaining stuff, and you are hooked
enough into the plot to go all the way to the end. If you can ignore the
initial weirdo guitar scene, ZERO EFFECT is watchable, unpredictable,
and entertaining. 

Title
Review for Hundred Percent (1998)
Synopsis/Opinion:
As I write this first draft, I'm sitting in a small auditorium at the
Art Institute Film Center in Chicago, scribbling my notes on a piece of
newspaper. An event called the Third Annual Chicago Asian American
Showcase is taking place. Right now actor Garrett Wang (from STAR TREK:
VOYAGER) is on stage, as is director Eric Koyanagi, some producers, and
the cinematographer. The men all seem to be cordial, laid back
professionals. They're here to field questions on HUNDRED PERCENT, the
new movie written and directed by Koyanagi which has just been shown. At
this time HUNDRED PERCENT has not yet been widely released, but it has
opened to enthusiastic responses at a Harvard test screening as well as
here in Chicago.
I saw the movie. HUNDRED PERCENT is one of those slice-of-life movies,
the kind that usually have names like MYSTIC PIZZA, the film about three
gal waitresses in a pizza parlor in Connecticut, and a two-season slice
of the girls' romance lives. HUNDRED PERCENT is a little like that,
except it's three Asian American guys in Venice Beach, and not
necessarily romance.
Actually HUNDRED PERCENT is three stories in one, an independent film
done up as a PULP FICTION-like collage of interwoven mini-episodes. In
the opening scene, a Star Trek debate in the middle of a dominoes game
involving the three Southern California guys quickly turns into a
flashback review of their recent experiences. Each man is a
twenty-something Asian American. Isaac (Dustin Nguyen) is an average Joe
who works behind the counter of a coffee bar. Isaac's story is a
romance: he meets and falls in love with a mysterious sexy woman dressed
in black (Tamlyn Tomita) who's on the run from a guy with a gun. Slim
(Darion Basco) is a dreadlock-wearing wannabe rasta man who is supposed
to take good care of a vicious gangster's favorite car, but is afraid of
what might happen when he must face the gangster to tell him the car is
missing. Troy (Garrett Wang) is an aspiring actor who finds that he
doesn't agree with the racist caricatures he is forced to play. He must
decide whether to kiss butt or give up his dream.
I felt a little peculiar after watching HUNDRED PERCENT, because I knew
the movie had made a statement, but I couldn't quite put my finger on
what statement had been made. The answer was both obvious and hidden at
the same time, because I was looking for a statement made by the plot,
but the statement was made by the movie itself. 
Let me explain. In Hollywood, Asian American actors get short shrift.
With few exceptions, there are really only three types of roles Asian
Americans ever get: the nerdy studious geek, the kung fu man, or the
jabbering guy with a funny, unintelligible accent. And any national
'racial' debate is always silent on Asian Americans: even Tiger Woods
and Andrew Cunanan are not portrayed as Asian Americans. Let's face it:
70% of the roles offered to Asian Americans in 1998 are hackneyed
stereotypes. So the odd thing about HUNDRED PERCENT is that it's chock
full of Asian American actors and actresses who go about playing their
roles as if it's entirely normal for them to go about playing their
roles. I find this to be a very profound, even revolutionary message, as
well as the reason why one of the mini-stories involves an Asian
American actor making tough choices, and why the ending involves a
fortune cookie message for the three Asian Americans.
Getting back to the film, the cinematography in HUNDRED PERCENT is
interesting in that it's filmed wider than most normal films, giving the
Venice Beach setting a quaint, yet larger than life feel. HUNDRED
PERCENT also sports an all star cast. You may recognize Nguyen from 21
JUMPSTREET, Tomita from THE JOY LUCK CLUB, and Troy's girlfriend
Cleveland (Lindsay Price) from THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL. Two of the
plots have unexpected endings, and the romance has a typical ending, but
Dustin Nguyen sparkles in his role as romantic lead.

Title
Review for Fire Down Below (1997)
Starring: Steven Seagal, Marg Helgenberger, Harry Dean Stanton, Stephen
Lang, and Kris Kristofferson 
Written by Jeb Stuart and Philip Morton. Story by Jeb Stuart. 
Synopsis: 
To set up the situation, the first five minutes of this movie explain
that an evil mining corporation is illegally dumping radioactive waste
in the backwoods of Kentucky, and that EPA agent Jack Taggert (Steven
Seagal) is being sent to Kentucky to convince the scared local
townspeople to testify against the big bad company.  
The movie has two main plots: 1) Taggart attacks evil mining tycoon Orin
Hanner (Kris Kistofferson) and Hanner's thugs because they once killed a
fellow agent and friend of Taggert's, and; 2) Taggert courts a local
outcast named Sarah (Marg Helgenberger). He tries to charm the scared
townsfolk into testifying by giving them rides in his pickup truck,
repairing wooden porches, and making a speech during a church service. 
"Fire Down Below" features no big climactic battle, but does contain a
few skirmishes lasting a few seconds a piece, where big Taggert (Seagal)
gets to bully some undersized townfolk who are lackeys of the evil
corporation. 
Aikido content: Martial artist turned actor Steven Seagal is a real life
Aikido expert.  In most Seagal movies Seagal can usually be counted on
for at least a kote gaeshi outward wrist turn, a sankyo controlling
wristlock, and an irimi nage entering throw where he sidesteps forward
and to the left and then clotheslines the opponent with his free right
hand. In "Fire Down Below" Seagal manages at least a few sankyos and an
irimi nage throw, but 90% of the time he uses standby moves such as
front kicks to the groin and shoves. He does a new move - squeezing the
neck with the fingers - probably twice. The fight photography often
shows dark shots of people falling to the ground quickly and not getting
up. These 'instant victory' fight scenes seemed too short, easy, and
anticlimactic, so they didn't build any suspense or sense of impending
danger for upcoming scenes .
Opinion: A typical action movie such as Seagal's earlier movie 'Under
Siege' (1992) has short skirmishes building in suspense, leading to a
climactic final confrontation. "Fire Down Below" doesn't do this
(despite containing quite a few short scenes where good guy Taggert gets
to domineer and bully people he doesn't like), so "Fire Down Below"
appears to be more of an winded environmental drama than an accelerating
action flick. The end result is that this pro-ecology film feels like an
hour-long drama that has been stretched an extra 43 minutes to become a
movie. If you're into country music, you'll enjoy a lot of wonderful
cameos by celebrities such as Randy Travis and others in scenes where
Jack Taggert escorts his girlfriend around town.

Title
Review for Bride of Chucky (1998)
Ingredients: Possessed plastic dolls in love, plastic dolls having sex
Starring: Jennifer Tilly, Voice of Brad Dourif, Katherine Heigl, Nick
Stabile, John Ritter
Synopsis:
This is the fourth film in the CHUCKY series, which debuted in the late
1980s. Basically, Chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk
because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer. In BRIDE OF
CHUCKY, Chucky's longtime girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) dies and
her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo. Dolls Tiffany
and Chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in New
Jersey, where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans. The dolls
stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple, so
in the side plot, the couple suspects each other of being a murderer. 
Opinion:
BRIDE OF CHUCKY is an attempt at horror with humor, but doesn't succeed.
Somehow, Chucky moaning about mid life crisis, and how he should have
gotten married does not make for a very scary Chucky. And Tiffany
harping about mid life crisis, and how she should have gotten married
does not make for a very scary Tiffany. The suspenseless BRIDE OF CHUCKY
relies mostly on Jennifer Tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the
first half, and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second
half. The best that can be said about BRIDE OF CHUCKY is that it is
sarcastic.

Title
Review for My Favorite Martian (1999)
Written by: Sherri Stoner and Deanna Oliver
Starring: Jeff Daniels, Christopher Lloyd, Daryl Hannah, Elizabeth
Hurley
Synopsis:
MY FAVORITE MARTIAN is a special effects comedy based on the 1963 black
and white TV sitcom of the same name starring Ray Walston and Bill
Bixby.
A young Santa Barbara newsman named Tim stumbles upon a crashed Martian
spaceship and befriends a wacky but kindhearted Martian as well as the
Martian's sentient space suit. To help the friendly Martian remain
undetected, Tim and the Martian pretend the Martian is Tim's "Uncle
Martin." Funny situations arise out of cultural misunderstandings,
attempts to remain inconspicuous in the community, and trying to
outsmart alien-catching dark-suited agents from a menacing research
organization called SETI.
Meanwhile Martin tries to help Tim's romance life. Tim fantasizes about
glamour gal Brace (Elizabeth Hurley), but isn't plain coworker Lizzie
(Daryl Hannah) closer to his heart?
Opinion:
Truth is stranger than fiction. Blurry, high altitude shots of the Mars
northern hemisphere's Cydonia region (taken by the 1976 Viking I Mars
orbiting probe and published by the National Space Science Data Center)
reveal what seem to be various triangular, square, and 5-sided pyramidal
objects, along with straight lines among and between them. Most
intriguing is a gigantic Washington Monument-type obelisk standing tall
on the side of a huge crater and casting a long shadow. Since craters
are large indentations caused by meteorites smashing into the ground,
it's likely the monument was created after the crater formed; otherwise
it would have been smashed to smithereens by the meteorite. If so, what
natural process could have erected a tall, thin, pointy structure? It
would take a six-month journey from Earth to Mars in order to reach the
site and investigate.
As for the movie, fans of the 1960s TV series will recognize the theme
song and welcome the familiar face of Ray Walston. There's not a whole
lot of substance to MY FAVORITE MARTIAN, but plenty of energetic running
around and MEN IN BLACK-style morphing into goofy alien creatures make
it entertaining as a children's film. Parents, however, should be warned
there are some instances of crude humor that aren't too appropriate for
little kids such as the space suit growing breasts and a scientist
hinting of sexual advances to a tied up lady.

Title
Review for Siege, The (1998)
Written by: Edward Zwick, Lawrence Wright, and Menno Meyjes
Starring: Denzel Washington, Tony Shalhoub , Annette Bening, Bruce
Willis 
Ingredients: FBI lawman, terrorism, US Constitution issues
Synopsis:
An honest and upright FBI lawman named Hub (Denzel Washington) is in
charge of fighting Middle Eastern terrorists bombing New York. But Hub
loses his authority when the President allows a power hungry US Army
general (Bruce Willis) to declare martial law over the city in response
to escalated bombings. The general abuses his powers. With the help of
his partner Frank (Tony Shalhoub) as well as a CIA agent named Sharon
(Annette Bening), Hub continues his investigations in a bid to solve the
bombings and regain his rightful authority. 
Opinion:
After watching this movie, I found an orange paper on the front
windshield of my car, on which was printed: "The stereotyping of Muslims
as terrorists ... leads to prejudice, hate, and bigotry."  Good point.
THE SIEGE plays suspenseful, sinister music during Muslim prayer, and
has bad guys perform a Muslim ritual prior to putting on white shrouds
and running amok trying to bomb innocent city folk. 
THE SIEGE tries to entertain us on a number of different levels, and
succeeds in one. As a drama about the plight of innocent Americans being
put in concentration camps, THE SEIGE doesn't develop much sympathy for
the victims because none of the victims are main characters. For
example, when a character shouts, "I must get my son out of the
concentration camp," it comes as a relatively emotionless surprise
because we don't even know his son. It would have been more dramatic if
the movie had thoroughly introduced us to the son, so that the audience
could bond and feel for the family's plight on a sympathetic level.
Similarly, when Hub yells at the general about the inhumane treatment of
Tariq, who is Tariq? A vicious terrorist? Or an innocent patsy fingered
by the real villain? Tariq's identity hasn't been developed, nor do we
know by the end of the film. He's just some unfortunate stranger. If
you're going to do a film about injustice, then "victim" parts should be
allowed to develop emotional "tug," rather than just provide surprise
material for Hub's power struggle with the army. 
On the intellectual level, THE SEIGE leaves a few things murky. Annette
Bening gets a huge part as Sharon, the CIA's sole expert. But it's not
clear whether Sharon is acting alone or on behalf of the CIA's present
goal, which is not explained either. In one scene, CIA Sharon acts as an
Army translator, so what's her actual mission?  In the movie there is
also a lot of wrangling back and forth about the fate of a mysterious
shake (sheik). But the discussion peters out, and we never get to see
the sheik. 
On the good side, the acting is done well, and there are a few scenes
with some chasing around and or featuring fancy spy hardware. As a drama
about Hub's authority struggle with the army, THE SEIGE does okay.

Review for Jackie Brown (1997)
Synopsis: 
Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) - -  an impoverished stewardess for a dumpy
airline - - makes money on the side by smuggling cash from Mexican
buyers to LA gunrunner Ordell (Samuel Jackson). She is caught smuggling
by Ray (Michael Keaton) - -  an agent from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms. Now the ATF wants Jackie to testify against
gunrunner Ordell, and Ordell wants Jackie very dead. Jackie tells Ordell
she'll fool the ATF and smuggle him half a million dollars from Mexico.
She tells the ATF she'll fool Ordell and they can catch him in the act
of receiving fifty thousand smuggled dollars. Her real plan is to have
the ATF arrest Ordell, and then pocket Ordell's half million dollars
herself through an elaborate ruse involving a shopping mall dressing
room - - so that she can finally live happily ever after with her
boyfriend Max (Robert Forster). Will Jackie's scam succeed?
Opinion:
JACKIE BROWN is fairly enjoyable but two things bug me. First, it takes
a whole hour for the movie to explain and set up the initial situation. 
After that, there is nothing left for the audience to figure out for the
next hour and thirty minutes. Once Jackie reveals her plan to Max in the
beginning of the movie, it seems the whole caper goes off predictably
without a hitch, twist, surprise, or problem. It's just a matter of
seeing the mechanics of the thing, and one scene is shown three times
(through the eyes of three different characters) to make sure we
understand how the money is switched. Still, it is kind of nostalgic
hearing the 70s soundtrack and seeing action gal icon Pam Grier get
tough on crime like the good old days. Of course, Tarantino throws in
some side characters with flippant, slang dialogue.
Director:
Director Quentin Tarantino is a master at elevating old B-grade movie
stuff to the status of A-grade retro. Like Woody Allen, he always gives
us amusing neurotic characters with hip dialogue. The difference is,
Tarantino's neurotic characters are always TV trivia savvy, and his bad
guys are likely to be violent. Sometimes Tarantino's movies seem to be a
collage of scenes or vignettes put together into a film mosaic.
Personally I would love to see Tarantino direct a sequel for the JAMES
BOND or SCREAM movie series because of Tarantino's talent for mixing
homage with edge. The Bond movie could pay homage to previous Bond
movies, while SCREAM 3 could add action to the horror whodunit series by
being about kung fu video trivia fans being stalked by a masked karate
killer. 

Title
Review for Boxer, The (1997)
Written by: Jim Sheridan and Terry George
Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Emily Watson, Gerard McSorley
Synopsis:
Irish boxer Danny Flynn has just gotten out of prison. He was in an
Irish prison because he took the rap for an Irish Republican Army buddy
named Harry (Gerard McSorley). Danny has suffered his 14-year sentence
in silence without ratting on anyone and now he is finally out.
Unfortunately, he lives in Belfast, Northern Ireland, an urban setting
where Catholics and Protestants are in violent political confrontation
with each other, and random bombings are a fact of life. Back on the
street, Danny tries to sort out his life by starting a boxing training
center. He also restarts a relationship with his former lover, Maggie
(Emily Watson) who is now married to a jailed IRA terrorist and has a
preteen boy. Danny fights a total of two boxing opponents during the
entire film, which is not about boxing. The film is actually about
intense sadness and despair and a messed up political situation which
can't seem to be solved. THE BOXER is a sympathy movie about Northern
Ireland.
Opinion:
There is a lot of fine acting in this movie, but the film crawls along a
little too slowly for my tastes; it has a slow pace and people speak
slowly, too. An oft heard line seems to be, "What do you mean?" THE
BOXER succeeds in portraying the dismal, unresolved, and hopelessly
depressing life of occupied Belfast more so than telling any story about
boxing competition. 
Speaking of boxing, I think actor Daniel Day-Lewis makes a very credible
boxer. His character is intense and brooding. His hands are fairly fast,
and he has nimble footwork. He throws the left straight, with crispness
and authority. Punches thrown with the right hand, however, have a
crooked looping motion, and seem weaker. Daniel would probably make a
passable real life southpaw, provided he remembers not to drop his left
guard after each punch. 

Title
Review for Quest for Camelot (1998)
Written by: 
Kirk De Micco, William Schifrin, Jacqueline Feather, David Seidler from
a novel (THE KING'S DAMOSEL) by Vera Chapman.
Starring the voices of: Jessalyn Gilsig, Cary Elwes, Gary Oldman
(Singing voices for Kayley and Garrett are: Andrea Corr, Bryan White)
Synopsis:
In this animated feature, beautiful Kayley (voice of Jessalyn Gilsig)
wants to become a knight of the Round Table - - like her father, the
late Sir Lionel (voice of Gabriel Byrne), who was killed defending King
Arthur (voice of Pierce Brosnan) from the rogue knight Ruber (voice of
Gary Oldman). One day, Ruber's monstrous flying pet griffin (voice of
Bronson Pinchot) steals King Arthur's magical sword Excalibur and
accidentally loses the weapon in flight, dropping it into the forbidden
forest. Ruber, who has recently kidnapped Kayley's mother Juliana (voice
of Jane Seymour), seeks the sword, and also plots to attack Camelot with
enchanted metal warriors. 
On a quest to find the forbidden sword, Kayley enters the forbidden
forest. There she meets a blind and handsome boy falconer Garrett (voice
of Cary Elwes) and a friendly two-headed dragon (voices of Eric Idle and
Don Rickles). Will Kayley, Garrett, and pals recover Excalibur and foil
Ruber's attack?
Opinion: 
Warner Brothers' QUEST FOR CAMELOT is similar to 20th Century Fox's
ANASTASIA in that both movies are attempts by non-Disney studios to
capitalize on the Disney-watching crowd. 
The best modern animated films include a sharp script, great songs, and
detailed artwork. Many use rotoscoping - - a technique where one takes
live action footage, and inks it into the animation by copying each
frame onto animation paper (ex: for SNOW WHITE, Disney hired Marjori
Belcher to do the dancing). Thus, even with a cartoon you can mimic
interesting camerawork: having the viewing angles zoom in, spin, and
move around. 
But don't expect any of the above from QUEST FOR CAMELOT, which is a
middle-of-the-road movie. Actually, I get the impression QUEST FOR
CAMELOT was hurriedly created, because the film lacks attention to the
story's finer details. The blind falconer doesn't act convincingly
blind; the two-headed dragon tries rapidfire comedic patter (like Robin
Williams' genie in ALADDIN) but sounds irritating rather than cute; the
hero gets hit with an arrow and two seconds later sings a song (and
stumbles on a magical plant that heals all wounds); the protagonists
tramp through dangerous forests when they could just as easily ride
magic helicopter plants; they mosey along with no sense of urgency
during life-threatening situations where they should be running in fear
for their lives: et cetera. In other words, QUEST FOR CAMELOT is
contrived rather than compelling. And as for music, coming out of the
theater, nobody could remember a single song from the soundtrack. This
is mediocre stuff.
On the bright side, QUEST FOR CAMELOT soundtrack features songs from
Celine Dion and LeAnn Rimes. QUEST FOR CAMELOT also features the voices
of a star studded cast. Very young children probably won't notice the
numerous plot holes, and it has a happy ending.

Title
Review for Lost in Space (1998)
Ingredients:
Scientific family in a spaceship, saboteur, military guy, big battle
with space spiders, futuristic cryosuits, time bubble, 750 special
effects
Starring: 
William Hurt, Jack Johnson, Matt LeBlanc, Gary Oldman, Mimi Rogers,
Lacey Chabert, Heather Graham
Synopsis:
Just when Earth has nearly expended its resources, humanity has found
another habitable planet called Alpha Prime. The trouble is, it takes
ten years by spaceship to get there. Professor John Robinson (William
Hurt) envisions a plan to build the first 'hypergate' - - a space device
that a starship flies through, which will instantaneously transport the
starship to a similar gate light years away. A hypergate is important
because attempting to fly through hyperspace without a gate means your
ship may end up at any random spot in the Universe.  Robinson plans to
take his family on a ten-year journey to Alpha Prime and construct a
hypergate there while folks on Earth build a similar gate on Earth. 
Unfortunately, when their super sleek ship (the Jupiter 2) gets
sabotaged Dr. Smith (who works for a terrorist group called the New
World Sedition) the Robinsons enter hyperspace without a hypergate, and
the hapless crew (Dad and Mom Robinson, doctor daughter Judy, rebellious
teen Penny, young whiz kid son Will, pilot Major West, and Dr. Smith)
gets LOST IN SPACE. In space the Robinsons must prevail over nasty space
spiders and an alternate grownup Will Robinson.
There are a few interesting cameos for fans of the old LOST IN SPACE TV
series on which this movie is based. Look for June Lockhart (The LOST IN
SPACE TV series mother) as a school principal, Mark Goddard (The LOST IN
SPACE TV series Major Don West) as a general, and Marta Kristen and
Angela Cartwright (the original Judy and Penny) as mission control press
conference reporters. If the robot's voice sounds familiar, it's because
it's still the voice of Dick Tufeld.
Opinion:
LOST IN SPACE is a 70 million dollar action epic based on characters
from the campy old LOST IN SPACE cult classic TV series about a father,
mother, daughter Judy, Judy's boyfriend Major Don West, rebellious
daughter Penny, young son Will, his robot, and the sneaky Dr. Zachary
Smith who are all lost in space and having adventures while trying to
get back to Earth. The original TV series was about ray guns and robots
and 50s style family cohesion. LOST IN SPACE (1998) is a more intense,
cutting edge version of the same characters that hits nostalgic buttons
but modernizes the space epic with better special effects and 1990s
family issues. The main idea is to take big effects sci-fi adventure and
meld it to a family situation framework. (Speaking of family, there's
even a scene that parodies THE WALTONS. )
Does LOST IN SPACE succeed in what it's attempting to do? 
I like the way the characters start off in the beginning. FRIENDS star
Matt LeBlanc gets a good change of pace. He plays Major Don West. West
is a military man, an aggressive, instinct and testosterone guy who is
sure to clash with cerebral scientific leader Professor Robinson. Lacey
Chabert as the rebellious Penny also seems promising as a possible
family issue subplot. Unfortunately, the movie pairs Penny off with a
cutesy space monkey and forgets about her problems in order to focus on
the less interesting character brainy Will. Similarly, Judy starts off
witty against the flirtatious Don West, but quickly is relegated to the
status of background Barbie doll, her banter quickly becoming old hat. 
On the good side, the thrill ride is good, the heroes sharper than TV,
the villains and threats more intense; danger really means danger. LOST
IN SPACE starts off with a space battle and the action keeps on going:
planets explode, robots open fire on monsters, zooming ships avoid
impossible collisions, and so on. But the pace alternates between
trigger-happy action, and slow, stilted dialogue without really getting
the balance right. Even the music can't decide whether to be orchestral
or to be modern. As a result, LOST IN SPACE more like a set of segmented
full-tilt serial adventures (with dark lighting and music to match) than
a single cohesive film. The film rushes forward on stop-and-go action,
and then on the last exciting serial adventure the movie abruptly ends.
Several plot threads are left unresolved. For example, early on the
family spots a fearful alien spacecraft, and the camera zooms in on it
ominously, but afterwards no further mention is made of the issue.
Likewise, Dr. Smith receives a nasty, venomous spider bite that has the
potential to mutate him into a monster, and the camera zooms in on
Smith's wound ominously, yet at the end of the film, we still don't know
whether Smith ever receives medical attention for the bite. 
LOST IN SPACE is a swooshy entertaining flick, relying heavily on its
stunts and 750 special effects. It falls in the Summer Blockbuster
category, even though it's only April. However, the film can be so much
more with a bit more fine tuning. Call me an optimist, but I'm sure - -
that if the two proposed sequels to this movie pay attention to things
like smooth pacing, brighter cinematography, sharp dialogue, making use
of female character issues, and producing the feel of one continuous
plot as opposed to the bump-and-go feel - - then the sequels can build
successfully upon the foundation introduced by LOST IN SPACE. 

Title
Review for Bug's Life, A (1998)
Written and Directed by: John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton
Starring: 
Voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Hayden Panettiere, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, David Hyde Pierce, Roddy McDowall,
Jonathan Harris, Richard Kind
Ingredients: Ants and grasshoppers in human situations.
Synopsis:
A gang of big mean grasshoppers is extorting protection money from a
cowering colony of little ants. One day an innovative ant named Flik
(Dave Foley) goes on a quest to find bugs who might be willing to save
the colony from the bad guys. Coming upon recently fired flea circus
performers, Flik mistakenly believes they are altruistic commandos.
Opinion:
A BUG'S LIFE is sure to please both parents and children. First, take
your basic western (terrorized town, mysterious strangers ride in) and
then replace all violence with cartoon humor. Then change all the
townspeople to cute, kid-friendly Disney-style CGI insects. Add an
underdog hero, a hint of romance and a supporting character who's an
impetuous child (or in this case an impetuous young bug), and you have
yourself a hit movie.
It's amazing how computer generated imagery keeps evolving and getting
better. At the rate things are going, soon virtual characters will be
used just as often as real life actors and actresses, and the whole film
industry will go digital. Imagine, if technology keeps increasing, then
in the next evolution, all we'll need to do is use sensor clay to model
a performer's unique face and expressions, and all the action and
effects can be done by computer generation (intelligent software)
instead of live acting and stunts. If and when advanced computers become
commonplace it would reduce the cost of film-making by millions, since
only scripts, modeling, and intelligent software would be needed. 
Getting back to A BUG's LIFE, it's always fun to see if you can
recognize the voices in animated features. In A BUG'S LIFE you'll hear
echoes of LOST IN SPACE, PLANET OF THE APES, FRAZIER, SPIN CITY,
SEINFELD, and LA CONFIDENTIAL as well as the voice of the grand dame of
comedy, Phyllis Diller. Bring the family; you'll love it.

Title
Review for Titanic (1997)
Starring: 
Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates
Ingredients: 
Large sinking ship, two lovers from different economic backgrounds 
Synopsis: 
In this film, which is part romance and part disaster movie, an old lady
remembers, through flashbacks, how she found true love and tragedy while
aboard a luxurious ocean liner that unfortunately struck an iceberg and
sank over eighty years ago in 1912. TITANIC begins with an exploration
submarine recovering a piece of paper from the sunken wreck of an old
ocean liner. The paper turns out to be a sketch of a woman, and soon
enough, an old woman named Rose shows up, claiming the sketch is a
picture of her in her youth. She then reveals her story: as a young
woman Rose is originally aboard the ship Titanic as the fiancee of an
arrogant rich man named Cal (Billy Zane). But she doesn't love the guy;
she's being forced by her mother to marry Cal for economic reasons.
While aboard the ocean liner, Rose meets a penniless artist named Jack
Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and truly falls in love. Their romance,
however, is cut short when the ocean liner begins to sink into icy water
after striking an iceberg. The lovers must be ready to make the ultimate
sacrifice for each other.
Opinion:
TITANIC is similar to a Disney cartoon. You know the drill: a spunky
lovely heroine must choose between two men. The odds-on favorite is a
jerk, while the underdog has a heart of gold. The only difference is
that TITANIC is a little more tragic, and there's no singing. And
instead of using cartoon effects, it spends 200 million dollars on
special effects. All in all TITANIC is a good romance with superior,
believable effects for the most part. The acting is solid and dependable
as well.

Title
Review for Thin Red Line, The (1998)
Written by: Terrence Malick, adapted from the James Jones novel
Starring: Jim Caviezel, Sean Penn, Elias Koteas, Nick Nolte
Synopsis:
In this nontraditional film an American World War II army company is
ordered to assault an important hill on Guadalcanal that is held by
desperate and starving Japanese soldiers manning machine gun nests at
the top of the hill. The movie jumps disjointedly from one soldier to
another in order to expose inner thoughts, fears, flashbacks, and
philosophies. Two of its main themes are that war is surreal and
accomplishes nothing, and that all men are really facets of the same
oneness that pervades nature and the universe.
Opinion:
Watching THE THIN RED LINE is a little bit like seeing a seeing a three
hour slide show and hearing a poetry reading. The cinematography is
extraordinary, and the thoughts are mystical and deep. However, don't
expect a traditional story line or resolution because the THIN RED LINE
is more of a film experience than a story. The whole idea is to portray
the mindlessness of war. The good die with the bad. Men enter and leave
and are replaced like machinery. Savagery exists side by side with
nature's beauty. Each person must make sense of it on their own.

Title
Review for Summer of Sam (1999)
Written by: Spike Lee, Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli
Starring: John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody, Mira Sorvino, and Jennifer Esposito
Synopsis: 
It's 1977 in a small Italian American neighborhood in New York. Disco music
is popular, and the Sexual Revolution is on, but the people of New York are
not happy. In fact, they're terrified. As in Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING
a heat wave has the city in its grip, and peoples' tempers are flaring. The
cool of night offers no respite: the neighborhood is being terrorized by a
nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the Son of Sam. No one knows
who the Son of Sam is, and no one is safe.
All around New York people are different. Aside from cultural groupings and
ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals. In the
Italian American section of town a philandering husband named Vinny (John
Leguizamo) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long
suffering newlywed wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino). Vinny's friend Ritchie
(Adrien Brody) hates disco, works at a gay strip club and doesn't want any
of the neighborhood folks to know. Ritchie's girl Ruby (Jennifer Esposito)
is trying to escape a reputation as a slut. Everyone's different, but
nobody in the film wants to be framed as "alien" to the community. 
Unfortunately, the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits
neighbor against neighbor. 
Opinion:
Director Spike Lee's SUMMER OF SAM is not about a psycho killer. Nor is it
about cops trying to apprehend him. It's about differences and how, given
the right conditions, even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of
irrational suspicion.
One thing I found interesting in SUMMER OF SAM was the use of sex. In other
movies sex is glamorized. For example, James Bond gets a sexual reward for
winning. Or boring made-for-video "suspense" movies are spiked with
gratuitous lingerie scenes just to keep the audience awake. And every movie
or soap opera character in these flicks seems to have expert sexual
prowess. Not so with SUMMER OF SAM. In a very gutsy move director Spike Lee
shows sex without fantasy. Sex is there, but it isn't gratuitous or
titillating. In fact, some of the main characters are downright lousy in
bed. Sex is in the film because (sexual) deviance is part of the film's
major theme of "difference" breeding hostility. In my opinion this kind of
movie sex is cutting edge for 1999, as rare and thought-provoking in
American cinema as showing a spanking.

Title
Review for Fallen (1998)
Starring: Denzel Washington, Donald Sutherland, John Goodman, Embeth
Davidtz
Synopsis: 
Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) gets more than he bargained
for when his opponent is not a serial killer but the demon Azazel. When
a person who is possessed by Azazel touches another person, Azazel can
transfer from one person to another, making the demon nearly impossible
to catch. Similarly, if a person who is possessed by Azazel gets killed,
Azazel can jump into the body of a new host, provided the new host is
within a distance of about a sixth of a mile. 
Unfortunately, the demon Azazel carries a grudge against Hobbes for
killing his last host (a psycho killer), and wants to make Hobbes' life
miserable by framing him for murder and possessing Hobbes' loved ones.
Hobbes teams up with lady theologist Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) in
order to get some clues about how to stop Azazel for the final battle.
In the middle of the film, Hobbes is nearly flattened in the basement of
an abandoned forest cabin by some objects caving in. In the end Hobbes
uses this abandoned cabin as the setting for his battle with Azazel.
Opinion:
Denzel makes a sparking detective - - I would love to see him in another
detective movie. And John Goodman is good as Detective Hobbes' partner.
The beginning starts off crisp as the two cops search around for clues,
but the movie becomes about a half an hour too long as they keep
searching and searching and searching ad infinitum. Then the movie
changes pace and tosses in a quick, unpredictable surprise ending - -
but an ending that I think will be disappointing to audiences (I won't
reveal it, in case you see the movie). 
To make this movie better, if I were in charge, I'd chop off a half hour
of extraneous sleuthing and get to the battle right away. I'd also make
a gutsier relationship with Gretta (kissing allowed) and use the
'cave-in' as foreshadowing for a better ending - - where the bad guy
should seem to win initially, but die by accident in a sudden cave-in
when he slinks into the basement of the cabin.

Title
Review for Tong fong sam hop (1992)
Starring:
Michelle Yeoh, Anita Mui, Maggie Cheung, Damian Lau, Anthony Wong  Paul
Chin, James Pak, Shiguan Ren
Synopsis:
The plot of 'The Heroic Trio' revolves around a trio of costumed
superheroines. Police Commander Lau and his wife Tung witness a string
of mysterious baby kidnappings. Unknown to Lau and lucky for him Tung
(Anita Mui) is a masked vigilante called Wonder Woman. While
investigating the kidnappings, Wonder Woman meets a future teammate -- a
former badgirl turned bounty hunter named Chat (Maggie Cheung).
Meanwhile, the future third member of the Heroic Trio, Ching, (Michelle
Yeoh)  has been assigned by her evil master, a sorcerer, to steal a robe
of invisibility from a dying scientist whom she loves. Like the
musketeers and Dartagnan, Tung, Chat, and Ching initially fight each
other but eventually unite to battle Ching's evil master, a demented
oriental wizard who plans to use invisibility for world domination and
also wants to use the kidnapped babies to mutate a demonic royal ruling
class. The evil master and his associates are nearly impervious to
destruction, a situation which makes for exciting 'Terminator' style
battles.
Action Content: 
Hong Kong action choreography has come a remarkably long way from the
days of the old chop sockey flicks with their syncopated and unending
forearm thwacks. Flapping robes, whirling blades, spinning bodies and
people jumping up into the rafters come standard with kung fu movies,
but this movie in particular reminds me how far Hong Kong kung fu
choreography has evolved, and of the parallel between early American
theater and Hong Kong film. 
Back in the old days in American film when people did their own stunts
choreography was complex and very highly developed. We were graced with
the likes of physical comedian Charlie Chaplin, swashbuckler Douglas
Fairbanks, and dancer Ginger Rogers. Allowing for different culture,
Hong Kong film evolved along a similar path. For example, in Hong Kong
today self-effacing comedian Chaplin's influence is reborn in the likes
of Jackie Chan, while the spirit of Fairbanks' dazzling swordplay is
reborn in the similarly spectacular Hong Kong martial arts choreography
championed by the likes of Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li. Suspending our
disbelief for campy flying heroes, The Heroic Trio' contains some of
the most entertaining, intricate and fast paced weapons battles on film. 
Stars: 
For those unfamiliar with Hong Kong film, The 'Heroic Trio' is a good
introduction to 3 of Hong Kong's premier talents. 
Malaysian (but ethnic Chinese) martial artial artist Michelle Yeoh does
all her own stunts, and is presently Asia's top female action star. She
graduated from the Royal Academy of Dance in London (B.A. in Dance with
a minor in drama), and won Miss Malaysia in 1983. She played opposite
Jackie Chan in 'Supercop (1992)', was voted one of People Magazine's 50
most beautiful people (1997), and will be starring opposite Pierce
Brosnan in the James Bond thriller, 'Tomorrow Never Dies', scheduled for
release in December of 1997. 
Maggie Cheung played opposite Jackie Chan in Police Story (1985)'. She
is a former 1983 Miss World contestant who has won several Best Actress
awards, including the 1991 Turin Film Festival  ( Best Actress:
Farewell China'  ), the 1992 Chicago International Film Festival and
1992 Berlin Film Festival ( Best Actress: The Actress' ), and the 1997
Golden Bauhinia Award, ( Best Actress: Comrades - Almost a Love Story'
).
Anita Mui played a bespectacled store employee in Jackie Chan's Rumble
in the Bronx (1995)' but by then was already a legendary dancer and
singer on the Hong Kong pop scene. On April 8, 1992 the Mayor of San
Francisco declared the day to be "Anita Mui Day" to honor Ms. Mui's
contributions to a local nursing home. She won a Golden Horse Best
Actress award in 1987. The Mayor of San Francisco again declared Anita
Mui Day for San Francisco on October 26, 1993.  
Opinion:
If you're tired of big budget Hollywood and in the mood for an
entertaining Hong Kong swashbuckling action fantasy (dubbed), 'The
Heroic Trio' has it all: flying bullets; masks; capes; robes; a bounty
hunter; a superheroine running along power lines high above the ground;
secret underground caverns; poison darts; a reunion of long lost family
members; a dying scientist; invisibility; a runaway train; kidnappings,
and; a sorcerer with a flesh-eating henchman. The choreography is great,
and I was also surprised by the artful cinematography. The camera work
not only manages to successfully capture the fast and furious fights,
but also includes stunning visuals such butterflies, rain, tears, blood,
and lightning in a dark fantasy setting reminiscent of Batman's Gotham
City. One note: good guys, bad guys, and objects defy gravity a lot.

Title
Review for Enemy of the State (1998)
Starring: Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Lisa Bonet 
Ingredients: National Security Agency, innocent guy, video tape that
everyone wants 
Synopsis: 
In this thriller, Robert Dean (Will Smith) is an upscale lawyer and
family man who possesses a video tape containing incriminating film
footage of a mobster. The mobster threatens Dean with trouble if Dean
doesn't hand over the tape. When a desperate acquaintance bumps into
Dean, Dean unknowingly falls into accidental possession of a second,
unrelated tape wanted by an even more shadowy figure: a sinister
politician in charge of the NSA, a secretive American spy agency. In no
time, Dean finds himself on the run, chased by corrupt G-men, with his
posh former life turned completely upside down. Can Dean and his techno
ally Brill (Gene Hackman) finally figure out what's going on?
Opinion: 
Is there really an American intelligence organization called the
National Security Agency in charge of satellite imagery and electronic
surveillance? Actually yes. With offices worldwide, and an estimated 3
billion dollar budget, the NSA is one of the largest employers in the
state of Maryland and may be the world's primary employer of
mathematicians (read "computer codemakers and codebreakers"). The NSA
and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) together control most of the
satellite and telecommunications defense reconnaissance taking place
anywhere in the world. 
ENEMY OF THE STATE asks an intriguing question: "What if the powerful
NSA targeted an ordinary civilian instead of terrorists?" Interesting
proposition, and it's what makes the movie so fun. Dean's life is
totally invaded by bugs, cameras, networked videocam, and satellite
intelligence. His credit records and bank records are tampered with. His
phones and those of his friends, family, and acquaintances are tapped.
Insidiously, the NSA even plants tracking devices on Dean's clothing and
shoes. ENEMY OF THE STATE excels at portraying this devilishly clever
surveillance. And thanks to TOP GUN director Tony Scott there is plenty
of fast paced action as well: running around, car chases, helicopters,
explosions, et cetera. The only really predictable part is the fate of
Dean's girlfriend Rachel (Lisa Bonet). ENEMY OF THE STATE is a decent
thriller with an interesting proposition and a catchy ending.

Review for Negotiator, The (1998)
Written by: James DeMonaco,  Kevin Fox
Starring: Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey
Synopsis: 
Samuel L. Jackson plays ace Chicago police hostage negotiator Danny
Roman. Unknown to Danny, corrupt cops in Danny's precinct are running a
scam involving faked insurance claims. They kill Danny's partner and
friend, and frame Danny for the murder.
Danny's not an investigator, but as an expert in hostage negotiation, he
knows all about taking hostages. Danny finds the corrupt Internal
Affairs man whom he think is responsible. Desperate to prove his
innocence, he captures the corrupt official and two office personnel and
holds them hostage in their Chicago office, hoping to wring out a lucky
confession. The police besiege the office building, trapping Danny
inside with the hostages. Thus begins a tense standoff involving SWAT
teams, FBI, gunfights, and clever negotiations.
Opinion: 
THE NEGOTIATOR is a successful balancing act between hostage crisis and
slam bang action flick. Because the main situation takes place in a
small space involving hostages arguing with their captor, THE NEGOTIATOR
sometimes feels like a tight theater piece. But the drama is interrupted
by timely action sequences. (The authorities periodically break in with
escalating firepower, and Danny desperately outfights them to buy more
time to prove his innocence.) 
Danny hopes that either the bad guy might confess, or else enough
evidence to prove his innocence might be found laying around the office.
But the creative twist in THE NEGOTIATOR occurs when an intriguing third
possibility arises. Holed up in the office, Danny refuses to negotiate
with anybody accept Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), a steadfast police
negotiator from a non-corrupt precinct. If he can just convince Sabian
of his innocence, Danny might be able to get outside help. Similarly, if
he can win some of the office hostages over to his cause, he might be
able to enlist their aid. Danny's ability and resources for proving his
innocence become a game of negotiation.
THE NEGOTIATOR is about corrupt cops. In the beginning of the movie it
seems the heroes are trying to discover who is stealing from police
pension funds. But by the end of the movie, pensions funds are
forgotten, and the crime seem to be all about insurance fraud. Confusion
about the nature of the actual corruption is my only small complaint
about THE NEGOTIATOR. Ignoring the minor the scam confusion, THE
NEGOTIATOR is an otherwise well-acted, satisfyingly taut,
mouse-versus-cat thriller. It's the only chess game in town that comes
with theater-style drama in addition to SWAT teams, grenades, and police
helicopters.

Review for Mercury Rising (1998)
Written by: Ryne Douglas Pearson, Lawrence Konner, and Mark Rosenthal
(from a novel by Ryne Douglas Pearson)
Starring: Bruce Willis, Miko Hughes, Alec Baldwin, Kim Dickens
Ingredients: Autistic kid, disgraced FBI agent looking for redemption
Synopsis: 
A nine-year-old Chicago autistic boy named Simon (Miko Hughes)
accidentally breaks a top secret government code that was placed in a
dime store puzzle book. The problem is that Lt. Colonel Kudrow (Alec
Baldwin) of the National Security Agency has a lot of money invested in
the code. Kudrow reasons that if the kid can crack the code, then he's a
security hazard that must be terminated. Soon Kudrow's hired assassin
wipes out Simon's hapless parents.
Meanwhile down-in-the-dumps outcast FBI agent Art Jeffries (Bruce
Willis) is assigned to find Simon. He finds Simon and then, while on the
run, must figure out who's trying to murder the boy and why. In the
process, he bonds with Simon.
Opinion: 
The premise of MERCURY RISING sounds promising. After all, what audience
can resist feeling for a handicapped kid in trouble, hounded by
sinister, big bad government forces? Unfortunately MERCURY RISING
suffers from two major movie turnoffs: a passive hero and a contrived
plot. 
Ideally in a movie you want a hero to be actively searching for clues or
nosing around for ways to conquer or circumvent a terrible dilemma. But
Art Jeffries - - the FBI hero of this story - - doesn't do this. He gets
chased and finds he can't trace the killer. Then he basically hangs out
and doesn't know what to do until the end of the movie, when an NSA girl
contacts him.
The plot? It leaves you asking questions such as "How did the dead guy
with a bullet in his brain manage get up and dial 9-1-1? And why would a
beautiful single woman wake up and willingly open her apartment at 2:00
AM to a strange man? And if the nerds knew the bad guy was a killer, why
did they just sit there and wait for the killer to kill them?" The
actions seem contrived.
On the other hand, the dramatic strategy behind MERCURY RISING is to
develop audience sympathy for the autistic kid and the disgraced FBI
hero and then give us a happy ending for them. MERCURY RISING does this.

Review for Bowfinger (1999)
Starring: Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham
Synopsis: 
In this comedy small-time moviemaker Bowfinger (Steve Martin) dreams of
creating his first movie but is locked out by the big entertainment
monopolies. One day Bowfinger is 49 years old and still hasn't accomplished
his dream, so he pulls out his live savings, grabs a B-movie script about
aliens taking over the world, assembles a no-pay crew of misfits, dreamers,
and illegal immigrants and takes the plunge. 
When paranoid big-name action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) refuses to do
the film, Bowfinger hits upon a novel solution: to film Ramsey without his
knowing it and use a geeky double named Jiff (also played by Eddie Murphy)
to act the rest of the scenes. Will Bowfinger's alien film CHUBBY RAIN ever
make it out of production? 
Opinion:
Amazing. What a great week for movies! Whether you see THE IRON GIANT,
DICK, DEEP BLUE SEA, THE SIXTH SENSE or BOWFINGER you can't lose. They're
all good.
Steve Martin is known by his fans as a comedian, but in this one Martin
plays the straight man while the comedy is left to Murphy and jibes at the
Hollywood moviemaking system. It works. Murphy is hilarious both as
paranoid star Kit Ramsey, who thinks he's seeing aliens in the corners of
his eyes, and as Jiff, the dimwitted video renter who must try to appear
like an action hero. 
Heather Graham does a realistic job portraying an actress who can't act.
Federal Express, and Starbucks also make noticeable appearances. 
BOWFINGER is funny. Whimsical, yes, but get ready to chuckle your socks off
and smile for a good 90 minutes.

Review for Simply Irresistible (1999)
Starring: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flanery
Synopsis:
SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is a lighthearted romantic comedy about the magic of
two people getting together in New York. Beautiful young Amanda (Sarah
Michelle Gellar) has inherited a tiny, quaint, corner restaurant which
has been in the family for 70 years. But she's a terrible cook and the
business is foundering. Miraculously Amanda's luck takes a turn for the
better, and she's suddenly turning out culinary masterpieces that
literally cast magical spells on the people who eat them: desserts that
make people turn giddy and fall passionately in love or appetizers that
cause tears of joy. Amanda meets a dapper but commitment-phobic young
hunk named Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery). Will the romantic magic hold?
Will the two soulmates get together in the end despite a few misgivings
and misunderstandings?
Opinion:
Magical food and magical romance? SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE is a warm and
delectable Valentines Day charmer about the fun, coincidence and
enchantment of meeting someone special. You can probably guess the main
outlines of any comedy about romantically destined soulmates, but in the
case of SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE it's delicious watching it happen, and the
sweet story leaves you with a happy melting feeling at the end. Bring
your significant other. Happy eating.

Title
Review for Tarzan (1999)
Starring: the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Rosie O'Donnel, Glenn
Close, Lance Henriksen, and Wayne Knight
Synopsis: 
Orphaned as an infant when his parents died in the African jungle, Tarzan
(voice of Tony Goldwyn) is adopted by the she-ape Kala (voice of Glenn
Close) and raised among apes as her surrogate son. Tarzan becomes adept at
jungle skills, but because of his obvious differences he is not quite
accepted as an ape by his adopted father Kerchak (voice of Lance Henrikson)
and others. When Tarzan stumbles across friendly zoologists Jane Porter
(voice of Minnie Driver) and her father as well as evil poachers he must
decide between his ape responsibilities and the lure of becoming human.
Rosie O'Donnel offers comic relief as Tarzan's buddy Terk, a gorilla with a
New York accent.
Opinion:
This animated gem puts an interesting spin the tale of Edgar Rice
Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes, this time painting a story about earning
acceptance. 
Adults will enjoy watch this version of Tarzan because he's not a wimpy,
passive, politically correct hero. With knife in hand, young Tarzan goes
one on one with a killer leopard and roars the Tarzan victory cry. And when
he gets trapped in the hold of a ship, he gets a crazed look in his eye and
begins to exhibit the wildness and claustrophobia of a cornered animal. 
On the other hand, children will LOVE this flick because it tells the tale
from a kid's point of view. Here's this young kid Tarzan growing up
slightly hyperactive, trying to come to grips with himself while surrounded
by big adult figures approving and disapproving, encouraging and
discouraging. He surfs down winding branches and careens through the trees
like a monkey to the tune of rhythmic pop music. He faces down danger or
runs away from it. He has exciting adventures and sticks to his values. He
finds his way.
Take the whole family. This one's worth it.

Title
Review for Virus (1999)
Written by: Chuck Pfarrer and Dennis Feldman, adapted from the Dark
Horse comic VIRUS
Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, William Baldwin, Donald Sutherland, and
Joanna Pacula
Ingredients: alien creature, troop of well armed crew members being
stalked
Synopsis:
With their tugboat damaged by a hurricane, the tugboat crew seeks refuge
in the eye of the storm, only to find another ship there: a huge,
deserted Russian space research vessel called the Volkov, equipped with
dozens of machine rooms and mechanized labs. Exploring the Volkov, the
tugboat crew comes upon the scientist Nadia (Joanna Pacula), the frantic
sole survivor of some sort of massacre. Nadia claims that an electronic
life form has invaded the ship by satellite and that the alien is using
the Volkov's power and labs to manufacture cyborg-like creatures in an
attempt to destroy mankind. The alien life form uses humans for spare
parts.
Of course nobody believes Nadia until people start disappearing and
showing up as spare parts on robotic attackers. Can Foster (Jamie Lee
Curtis), Steve (William Baldwin), and the others defeat the alien aboard
the Volkov before it takes over the world? Lucky for them the scientific
research vessel happens to contain an ample supply of guns, ammo,
missiles and thermite grenades.
Opinion:
I love the cast of VIRUS. Donald Sutherland as a creepy sea captain;
Jamie Lee Curtis as the heroine; William Baldwin as a seaman; it can't
get any better than this. VIRUS also has good effects, courtesy of
director John Bruno who happens to be a special effects expert. VIRUS
marks his debut as a director. I even like the bad guy: a ruthless,
faceless, personality-free, alien life form made of electricity trapped
in the circuitry of the ship.
What VIRUS lacks, however, is suspense. VIRUS works like a 50s B-movie
with an upgraded budget. People stumble along, weather a few attacks,
and at last find a loud way to end the thing. Ideally in a movie you
want the good guys to face a deadly opponent they know nothing about.
Through narrow escapes and small clues they should slowly learn enough
to theorize a way to beat the thing. But in VIRUS finding out about the
enemy is done too quickly and easily; it's just a matter of believing
whatever Nadia says, rather than thinking about clues. Similarly, in an
ideal technothriller, the audience should be shown some of the devious
traps the alien might be planning, in order to ratchet up the suspense
factor when the unknowing heroes are shown. But in VIRUS the audience
never gets shown the sneak peak, so a lot of opportunity for suspense is
lost.
There are also some unanswered questions concerning the incongruous
behavior of various characters. What does Captain Everton stand to gain
from his actions? Why would a special forces expert become hysterical
when all the civilians are calm? These actions don't make sense.
Suspense is when you know a character well enough to see that his
personality is going to put him in big trouble with the upcoming
situation he doesn't know about. But when characters act unbelievably,
some of that juicy anticipation is lost.
In short, it's fun watching the cast of VIRUS ham it up, and there are
plenty of high tech booms and bangs in this movie for amusement. But
VIRUS could be much better with a healthy dose of basic suspense.

Title
Review for Dark City (1998)
Written by: Alex Proyas, Lem Dobbs and David S. Goyer
Starring: Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly, William
Hurt
Ingredients: 
Man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder, dark science fiction
city controlled by alien beings with mental powers. 
Synopsis: 
What if you woke up one day, and suspected you were not on Earth, and
instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium
manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers? In DARK CITY John Murdoch
(Rufus Sewell) has this problem. 
DARK CITY starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery. Poor
John wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one
corner. A mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there,
and soon enough John is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale
people in black trench-coats, as well as by the police, and the dogged
Inspector Bumstead (William Hurt). Is John a murderer, and what can his
missing memories tell him? He searches through his own wallet for
possible contacts and clues. But when the clues don't fit, it doesn't
just confuse him; it causes John to go so far as to question the whole
nature of reality in the Dark City.
To John, something is fishy, and very unreal about this city. How come
it's always dark, and nobody seems to remember what they did this
morning? And how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city, or
how to get to nearby Shell Beach? Every night, around midnight, John
notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation, and
at this time, creepy alien experimenters known as the 'Strangers' come
out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads
with big hypodermic needles. The Strangers have the ability to 'tune,'
or warp reality using telepathic powers.
Turns out, the city is not on Earth at all. And the reason why John
doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation, is because he is
a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping
abilities as the Strangers. Even with the help of scientist Dr. Daniel
Schreber, can John take back the DARK CITY?
Opinion:
Director Alex Proyas (he also directed THE CROW) mentions this in the
DARK CITY press kit: In films, science fiction is always "used to have
big spaceships blow up cities. I think we're a little tired of that."
According to director Proyas, probably the most interesting thing about
DARK CITY is its layers. It's designed so that you can watch the film
over again, and examine it from the perspective of a main character
other than Murdoch. It's a philosophical piece.
Cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout
between the good humans and the bad aliens (whether they be Klingons,
giant bugs, or proponents of the dark side of the Force). But science
fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the
big questions, questions like who are we? What is the human condition?
What is ethical? What would a true human being do?
Far from comic book style on the order of SPAWN, BATMAN, or THE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES, DARK CITY not only features the showdown between good
humans and powerful aliens, but it also asks questions worthy of films
such as BRAZIL or BLADE RUNNER.
DARK CITY is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay.
A little more than 200 years ago, the world was filled with unhappy
peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was
controlled by totalitarian, military, conformist, medieval regimes. The
people took refuge in religion, the idea being that earthly life was a
time of suffering, but after death, Heaven would be available.
Meanwhile, the State used these same ideas to prop up their regimes; the
King was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by Heaven.
When science finally overturned religion, the medieval dictatorships
came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments. But the
new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used
to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old. This is the
time period when writers and philosophers such as Freud, Kant, Kafka,
Nietzsche, and Dostoevsky pondered what society should be, and what
place the individual had in it. The existentialists' in particular wrote
about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile,
indifferent, or alienated universe.
In DARK CITY, when the last dying, defeated alien asks John Murdoch why
the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed,
Murdoch replies, pointing to his head, "Because the human condition
isn't located in here." 

Title
Review for Avengers, The (1998)
Synopsis: 
The plot revolves around a failed weather project called Prospero, which
Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman) once worked on. British agent John Steed (Ralph
Fiennes) joins Peel in investigating, and soon they stumble upon an evil
plot to rule the world. 
Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery) is their main adversary. Sir August
has a weather machine which can control the weather of any part of the
world, and he wants countries to pay him tribute so that he won't attack
local weather. Sir August also has a serious Mrs. Peel obsession; he
keeps her painted picture up in his room. An island fortress serves as
de Wynter's base of operations.
Will Steed and Peel storm the island fortress and defeat de Wynter?
Background: 
The original 1960s serial THE AVENGERS featured Patrick MacNee and Diana
Rigg as a crime-solving duo. MacNee was John Steed, a dapper veddy
British chap, and Rigg was Emma Peel, a young, pretty, insatiably
curious, mystery-loving platonic widow friend of Steed's. Together they
drove an open-buggy car around the English countryside with a kind of
devil-may-care confidence - - cheerfully drinking tea and solving cozy
mysteries. 
The 1998 version of THE AVENGERS attempts to update these two characters
for the 90s, giving us Ralph Fiennes as Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma
Peel.
Opinion:
If you're anticipating a sophomoric film, here's a hint: the bad guys
are dressed as stuffed animals, and wear big teddy bear costumes. The
dialogue seems very forced, and you can find better British accents in
THE PARENT TRAP.
Actually the problem with THE AVENGERS is predictability. Right in the
beginning, Steed and Peel visit de Wynter's palacial estate to solicit
his expertise on weather. They find that de Wynter's mansion grounds are
filled with dangerous weather anomalies, and Steed gets attacked.
So we know de Wynter is the bad guy. Instead of busting the guy, Steed
and Peel go chasing around, belaboring obvious clues which, of course,
point straight back to de Wynter by the movie's end. "Why didn't you
tell me about de Wynter?" says Steed to his informant (Patrick MacNee).
To which Jones replies, "You didn't ask."

Title
Review for Thomas Crown Affair, The (1999)
Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Frankie Faison and Faye Dunaway
Synopsis: 
In the opening of this romance the air conditioning in an art museum
mysteriously malfunctions, and the scorching summer temperature soars high
enough to blank the infrared cameras. Soon a priceless Monet painting is
discovered missing. Catherine (Rene Russo), a lady insurance investigator
wearing a scarf, suspects the manipulative businessman and compulsive
gambler Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) is the culprit. The trouble is, Crown
looks great in a sweater and he owns a beautiful boat. Will Catherine fall
in love, or will she bring Crown to justice?
Opinion:
If I were the cops, I would have nailed Crown by simply fingerprinting the
picture frame which Crown carelessly discarded at the crime scene. But
aside from that, there was potential in this movie that never materialized.
Crown was a man so thirsty for challenge he was getting self-destructive.
And he might meet his equal in an attractive female adversary. The same
went for ace investigator Catherine. She could possibly match wits with
Crown and romance him the same time. And if the sparks didnt fly from the
two lovers one-upping each other there was the added possibility of
romantic competition in the form of Catherines gutsy and hones cop coworker. 
Alas, after the first 20 minutes it was obvious Catherine didnt like the
cop and didnt have the brains to match Crown. So the other two thirds of
this movie was like watching a card game where one guy has all the cards
and everyone else has nothing. The challenge evaporates. Catherine is
reduced to cackling or crying, and everyone stands around waiting to fold.
Pierce Brosnan fans get to see him at his good-looking best, but personally
I think the movie and the romance would have been spicier and sexier had
the protagonists been evenly matched.

Title
Review for She's All That (1999)
Starring: Freddie Prinze, Jr, Rachael Leigh Cook
Synopsis:
High school heartthrob and top jock Zach Syler (Freddie Prinze, Jr.)
gets dumped by his girlfriend Taylor (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) for a
self-absorbed MTV-type actor. On the rebound, Zach says to a buddy
something like: "Without her hair and makeup, Taylor is just a C-minus
GPA with a wonder bra. I can turn any female nerd into the high school
prom queen." Soon enough a bet is made, and an introverted girl named
Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) is selected for the relationship with Zach
which will turn her into the prom queen. Of course, once the glasses
come off, Laney is cute. Will true romance blossom? Will unpopular Laney
turn out to be a gem? Will cute Zach fall in love with Laney and realize
he's not just conducting a cruel experiment?
These days many TV shows and movies targeted towards teenage audiences
invariably star sexually active 20-something actresses and actors
masquerading as kids. One extremely disturbing trend in Hollywood lately
is the Lolita syndrome where an adult has a sexual relationship with a
child. For example in the TV show DAWSON'S CREEK a female teacher has
sex with a male student. In SHE'S ALL THAT, Zach's high school
girlfriend Taylor is the sex object of an older, MTV-type male actor.
Similarly, there's a hint of Lolita in the scene when Zach is crowned
prom king, and an enthralled female teacher plants a slobbery kiss on
Zach's face (imagine if it were male teacher and a female kid). The
previews shown at the movie theater ten minutes before I watched SHE'S
ALL THAT advertised another "teen flick" about two teenagers plotting to
sexually manipulate a naive girl. I'm glad that many so called "teen
movies" have a PG-13 rating, because you don't want child audiences to
mistake fantasy for reality.
Hollywood is fantasy. And if I am to believe my eyes, behavior which is
statutory rape in real life is "cutting edge" in TV and movies routinely
targeted towards younger audiences. Adult supervision, and rating these
movies PG-13 might help ensure that, before being exposed to societal
standards that nonchalantly portray adults having sex with high school
children, the youngsters in the audience can tell fact from titillation.
SHE'S ALL THAT is predictable material, but done tastefully and
artistically executed. For example, as Taylor explains to Zach why she
is dumping him and reminisces about a summer beach party, instead of
just leaving it as dialogue, the scene changes to the beach party
itself. Both Taylor and Zach physically step into the party like
phantoms and examine it even though Zach was never at the party and it's
just Taylor's explanation.
SHE'S ALL THAT is a teen romance about two good kids with good behavior
who end up liking each other. I watched the movie in a theater full of
teens (mostly girls coming to ogle Freddie Prinze, Jr.), and they seemed
well satisfied with it.

Title
Review for In & Out (1997)
Starring: Kevin Kline, Joan Cusack, Matt Dillon, Debbie Reynolds,
Wilford Brimley, Bob Newhart, Shalom Harlow and Tom Selleck
Ingredients:  a popular teacher who wears a bow tie; a long onscreen
kiss; pop psychology jargon ("After I based my entire concept of self
esteem on your willingness to marry me?"); physical comedy about macho
clichés; verbal barbs about dieting and Barbara Streisand movies.
This movie is a lighthearted comedy about acceptance. The dilemma is set
up in the first few minutes when former student Cameron Drake (Matt
Dillon), now a celebrity actor, receives a Best Actor award for playing
a gay soldier who gets discharged when it is discovered that he has
Bette Middler movies in his possession. As Drake accepts the Best Actor
award, he mentions that he owes his inspiration to Howard Brackett
(Kevin Kline), the high school English teacher of his hometown of
Greenleaf. Cameron tosses in a comment about Brackett's being gay. The
folksy residents of Greenleaf are wonderful but homophobic, so the tight
community nearly faints at the unbelievable revelation, especially since
it is only a few days before Brackett's wedding to long-suffering
fiancee Emily (Joan Cusack) and the town's upcoming Best Teacher Contest
and high school graduation.  After showcasing humorous reactions from
reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), the townspeople, students, and
Brackett himself, the movie takes us through the town's two big events
and into the ending.
Opinion:
In a light farce meant to satirize tabloid journalism, high school
principals, old TV shows, and stereotypes, it's surprising to find a
complicated character, but Kevin Kline successfully pulls off a lot of
implied character depth without unbalancing the movie's lighthearted
tone. Joan Cusack is sufficiently befuddled and exasperated as the
fiancee. Since the movie, like an interview, consists mostly of peoples'
overreactions to a single revelation, enjoyment of this comedy rests on
how funny the townspeople's remarks are, and scads of one-liners are
thrown, shotgun style,  to probe for laughs in different directions. For
example: bachelor party guys end up arguing over Barbara Streisand's
movie, Yentl,'; movie star Cameron (Matt Dillon) tells his whiny
supermodel girlfriend, "You look like a Swizzle stick," and; a gossipy
old woman confesses faking Rice Krispy treats in explaining that
everyone has something to hide.

Review for Wong Fei-hung chi saiwik hung si (1997)
ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA AND AMERICA (1997)
Chinese, with English subtitles. 
Also called Once Upon a Time in China VI (1997) 
Also called Wong Fei Hung Chi Sai Wik Hung Sze (Cantonese)
Also called Huang Feihong Zhi Xiyu Xiongshi (Mandarin)
Written by: Hui Qui Long, Shut Mei Yee, Shut Tiu Cheuk Hon, and Siu Man
Sing
Starring: Jet Li, Rosamund Kwan, Jean Wong, Chrysta Bell, Kwok-Pong
Chan, Xiong Xin Xin, Hung Yan-yan
Synopsis: 
ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA AND AMERICA (1997) is a screwball action
comedy on the order of BLAZING SADDLES or PAINT YOUR WAGON. It's
actually the sixth ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA movie. Movies one through
five of the series follow the adventures of hero Wong Fei-hong in China,
but ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA AND AMERICA takes places in the 1800s
American West. The film portrays the Western adventures of ONCE UPON A
TIME IN CHINA series hero Wong Fei-hong (Jet Li), who is simultaneously
a Chinese sage, a kung fu teacher, and a doctor.
The story begins with Fei-hong and his fiancee Yee (Rosamund Kwan), and
their faithful attendant Seven riding a stagecoach, intending to visit
Sol, a student of Fei-hung's who - - after immigrating to America - -
has invited Fei-hong to celebrate the one-year anniversary of his
medicinal clinic in a small town in the wild and woolly West. When the
stagecoach goes out of control, Fei-hong suffers a nasty bump on the
head, and soon ends up lost down the river with amnesia, where he is
adopted by a friendly Indian. Fei-hong is finally found by Yee and
recovers, but now there is a racist sheriff and some nasty gunslinging
bandits to contend with in town. Can Fei-hung, Seven, and their cowboy
friend Billy use kung fu to clean up all the injustice?
Opinion:
When you take a handful of good dramatic actors and actresses and
surround them with college kids from the local frat house, you end up
with an embarrassing Wild West, populated by straight-faced surfer dudes
dressed as both cowboys and Indians. But at least the fight scenes are
good.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN CHINA AND AMERICA is hilarious, but the
unintentional parts are funnier than the intentional. Everyone plays
their part with a straight face. For example, cowboy Billy has a perm
with platinum bleached blond surfer hair and brown roots, but he takes
his part seriously. As do all the Indian villagers who are poorly
disguised white actors wearing yellow and blue paint. Towards the end of
the film, the cowboy bandits start doing kung fu kicks and fifteen-foot
twirling leaps. Meanwhile, here's an example of an intentional joke:
"You're name is Seven, and I was the eleventh child in my family, so why
don't we team up and open up a store called 7-Eleven?"
The movie turns serious when Fei-hong makes two speeches exhorting the
Chinese Americans to be proud to be Chinese, and soon the Sheriff
threatens to hang every Chinese American in the town. Then the final
battle becomes humorous again when the cowboys start doing Shaolin
moves.

Review for Wag the Dog (1997)
Written by: Hilary Henkin and David Mamet, from the novel AMERICAN HERO
by Larry Beinhart
Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Anne Heche, Denis Leary,
Willie Nelson, Woody Harrelson
Synopsis: 
Does a dog wag its tail, or does the tail ever wag the dog? Do events
drive publicity or do publicity specialists drive events? In WAG THE
DOG, it's definitely PR wonks who drive events. This fun spoof is a
behind-the-scenes look at the mechanics of manipulating the American
public - - how over-the-top moguls in Washington and Hollywood use  the
media to control public opinion. Eleven days before the Presidential
election, Presidential aide Winifred (Anne Heche), political spin doctor
Conrad (Robert De Niro), and Hollywood producer Stanley (Dustin Hoffman)
are charged with a monumental publicity project. Although the President
has a comfortable 17% lead in the polls against his opponent, a breaking
new sex scandal concerning the President and a teenage girl threatens to
derail his upcoming reelection. Winifred, Conrad, and Stanley are hired
to distract the public's opinion from the sex scandal. To rally the
American people around the President as well as temporarily take all the
attention away from the sex scandal story, the three spin doctors
produce a fake war between America and Albania in their little movie
studio - - complete with heroes, victims, music, press conferences and
disaster footage. Just as Ronald Reagan's real life inexplicable flash
invasion of Grenada diverted public attention from what certainly would
have been public outcry over the murder of over 200 marines in Beirut,
the three spin doctors figure they can divert attention away from the
President's dubious morality by convincing America it is at war - - just
long enough to ensure the President's reelection. Will the eleven-day
ruse succeed?
Opinion:
I figure the average Hollywood movie these days costs 60 million dollars
to make and takes 90 days to film. Frankly, WAG THE DOG is a much better
movie, and it only cost 15 million to make and thirty days to film. WAG
THE DOG is a fine screenplay with superb acting and a resounding message
as well. The running gag is that the publicity is all fake, and the
public is eating it up.
Although in theory the American government has three branches
(executive, legislative, judicial), in practice it has four. The media
is the fourth branch of government, and we all know in our hearts that
American public opinion is regularly manipulated by media-savvy spin
doctors in Hollywood and Washington, espousing various angles for
economic or political gain. 
A racial minority allegedly kills a white. Which angle sells more
papers? In the O.J. Simpson case the press played the race card. In
Cunanan/Versace (Cunanan was Filipino) the press played the gay card.
Impartial news, or just angles for making more money? A Middle Eastern
minority male associated with arms dealing and his white girlfriend die
in a drunk driving accident, not wearing seat belts. Which angle sells
the most papers? The drunk driving angle, or "Princess' Fairy Tale Life
Gets Cut Short."  The answer, of course, is the fairy tale sells more -
- especially if it comes with commercial tie-ins such as tribute CDs
made from re-hashed songs to Marilyn Monroe, with advertisements for the
next album on the back, and perhaps film rights later on. Let's ask
ourselves. Are we being hooked and played for dollars by Hollywood and
Washington spin doctors?

Title
Review for Antz (1998)
Directed by: Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson
Written by: Todd Alcot, Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz
Starring: Voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Gene Hackman
Ingredients: Animated ants, bored worker ant seeking more to life
Synopsis: 
In an animated underground ant colony consisting of millions of ants,
all of the ants are workaholic conformists except two individualistic
ants. One is General Mandible (voice of Gene Hackman), a military
megalomaniac who secretly plots to destroy the ant colony and create a
master race. He plans to take advantage of the conformist ants by
getting them to unwittingly carry out his orders.
The other individual is the humble Z, a likable, scrawny, nerdy worker
ant (voice of Woody Allen), who decides that there must be more to life
than fulfilling a prescribed role. Z secretly wishes for free choice,
and rails against conformism in his loquacious monologues. 
A series of adventures ensues when Z falls in love with the Princess
Bala (voice Sharon Stone), and the two find themselves outside the
colony in search of a paradise called Insectopia. Later, Z and Bala must
thwart General Mandible's plot to destroy the colony. The moral of the
story is that unthinkingly accepting authority could turn you into
somebody else's pawn, unless you learn to think for yourself.
Opinion:
One of the fun things about watching animated movies is trying to guess
the voice behind the character. ANTZ features the recognizable voices of
Woody Allen (nerdy ant), Sharon Stone (princess ant), Sylvester Stallone
(buffed middle class soldier ant), Gene Hackman (megalomaniac general
ant), and Christopher Walken (flying ant). If you're good at this sort
of thing, see if you can spot Dan Aykroyd or Jennifer Lopez.
The good news is that ANTZ is an animated movie that adults can watch.
The computer effects are superb and there is no shortage of sardonic wit
or cultural references. The bad news is that ANTZ is not a kids movie
since the Woody Allen-style social commentary isn't intelligible for
young children. If forced to sit through it, they get antsy.

Title
Review for Notting Hill (1999)
Starring: Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant
Synopsis: 
Rich and famous actress Anna Scott (Julia Roberts) is walking down the
street when she bumps into William Thacker (Hugh Grant), the chatty,
handsome and humble owner of a tiny London bookstore barely making ends
meet. Of course he accidentally spills a drink on her, and it's love at
first sight. Thacker's underachieving, eccentric friends are thrilled for
him, but can a relationship between glitzy Hollywood royalty and a British
commoner really work out? 
Opinion:
We all know the romance formula. Cute meeting. Girl meets boy. Girl loses
boy. Fate draws them together for the big resolution. NOTTING HILL is no
different. The twist is that SHE is a celebrity and HE is a commoner, so
the situation makes for a fantasy relationship that any theatergoer or fan
can identify with. Meanwhile comic relief is provided by an underachieving
roommate. 
Julia Roberts does an excellent job playing Anna Scott, an overpaid and
indulged celebrity who admits she has very limited acting ability and that
her "acting" is merely good looks and body doubles. Anna is rotten at
relationships and carries a lot of petty emotional baggage. Roberts is
absolutely believable as the inept Anna. 
NOTTING HILL, however, must be considered a chick flick rather than a guy
flick. Women may thrill to a cute guy such as Hugh Grant's William Thacker,
but men are sure to abhor Thacker as someone from the legendary Neville
Chamberlain school of appeasement. Thacker humbly "understands" when Anna
sleeps around with other men. He kowtows and submits and indulges when Anna
throws cheap verbal abuse and directs mean-spirited tirades at him. His
answer to Anna's persistent bullying is, "Can I get you more tea, dear?"
Thacker needs a backbone, and fast. 
Male or female, if you continually are disrespected in a real relationship
and don't stick up for yourself the union won't last long. But we can
fantasize in NOTTING HILL, can't we?

Title
Review for Primary Colors (1998)
Written by: Elaine May (screenplay), based on the novel by 'anonymous'
(former NEWSWEEK political commentator Joe Klein)
Starring: Adrian Lester, John Travolta, Emma Thompson, Maura Tierney,
Billy Bob Thornton, Kathy Bates
Ingredients: 
Presidential primary elections, Bill Clinton-type candidate,
Hillary-type wife, young idealist
Synopsis: 
Is he or isn't he? That is the main question in this documentary-like
portrayal of a 1990s Presidential primary campaign. Is presidential
hopeful Jack Stanton essentially a decent man who must be ambiguous and
ruthless, and play hardball politics because the Presidential race
demands it, or is he an ambiguous and ruthless hardball politician who
is only playing at being a decent man in order to get votes? 
This is the main substance of the movie PRIMARY COLORS, and the question
remains unresolved even at the end of the movie. As a vehicle for
getting the audience to ask the question, PRIMARY COLORS follows the
'coming of age' of Henry (Adrian Lester), a young black idealist who
joins the staff of Governor Stanton's presidential campaign. Henry is
similar to real life former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos. Other
campaign staff members in PRIMARY COLORS include strategist Richard
(Billy Bob Thornton), gay Libby (Kathy Bates), and media relations
expert Daisy (Maura Tierney). 
At first Henry is enthralled and charmed by Stanton because he believes
he has at last found a decent politician. But as the campaign winds its
way through two sex scandals and mudslinging attacks by political
opponents, Henry learns that Stanton might in fact be a ruthless
pretender. So is he, or isn't he? Henry ponders.
John Travolta plays Presidential hopeful Governor Jack Stanton and Emma
Thompson plays the governor's wife Susan Stanton. They seem to look and
act exactly like Bill and Hillary Clinton (including Bill Clinton's
silvery hair, high pitched voice, and Southern accent). Because the
movie is based on a 1996 'Washington insider' book about Clinton, the
movie dramatizes events that parallel Clinton's first presidential
primary campaign. A large part of their campaign involves dodging a big
sex scandal involving a Gennifer Flowers-type hair salonist named
Cashmere McCleod. 
Opinion:
The movie PRIMARY COLORS cannot be separated from the events of real
life. In WAG THE DOG the fictional American President was hit with a sex
scandal and responded by deflecting media attention to a bogus war with
Albania. In real life President Clinton was hit with allegations of
sexual misconduct, and media attention soon turned to an impending
showdown with Iraq. 
Today, fresh from the Monica Lewinsky scandal, in which President
Clinton was criticized for deliberately obstructing people from knowing
about his sex life, President Clinton faces more sex allegations from
Kathleen Willey. Similarly, in PRIMARY COLORS, zipper-guy candidate
Stanton faces pressure from accusations that he had sex with a
hairdresser and impregnated a teen baby sitter. And just as the
fictional Stanton beats the scandals, it seems very odd, but Clinton's
approval ratings seem to rise after each new woman.
So what are we to make of PRIMARY COLORS, a movie which concentrates not
on policies or issues, but on whether or not we should trust the lying,
philandering Stanton to be a good President?
In my opinion PRIMARY COLORS is not particularly exciting, and it never
really answers its principle question. It is a well acted movie, and
does an excellent job of depicting complex and relevant people in thinly
disguised real life situations.

Title
Review for Woo (1998)
Ingredients: Nerdy law clerk, wild dream girl, night on the town
Synopsis:
A party-loving hot babe named Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith) finds out from
her astrologer that she is fated to fall in love with a Virgo. Her
friends fix her up on a blind date with an unexciting law clerk named
Tim, but Tim turns out to be a Virgo, so Woo consents.
The rest of the movie portrays what happens during their night on the
town. The two don't get along because Woo feels that Tim is boring and
uptight, and Tim is upset about his car getting stolen, and getting
punched out at a club. Woo also doesn't like the fact that Tim's macho
buddies make fun of him. 
Will they stick with each other despite a trying night?
Opinion:
WOO portrays the main couple as being totally incompatible but for a
dubious astrological connection. However, the chemistry's okay between
Jada Pinkett Smith and Tommy Davidson. 
Will Tim lighten up? Will Woo accept Tim? Will they temporarily break up
and then starting reminiscing about the good things they saw in each
other? You already know the answer. The slapstick is entertaining
(restaurants and cars get busted up, people dressed in yellow chicken
suits) but the film is unremarkable in that it feels like we've seen
these stretches of drama and slapstick before.

Title
Review for American Beauty (1999)
Starring: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley
Synopsis: 
Upper middle class, suburban family man Lester (Kevin Spacey) realizes that
he is just going through the motions: he is unable to feel passion; he is
soulless, cynical, and no longer able to feel the edge between success and
failure. Everyone else around him has similar symptoms. Lester's
unassertive daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is too lethargic to change her
world, yet all too ready to whine and complain. His wife Carolyn (Annette
Bening) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist
slogans. And these are people with a big house and a decent standard of
living.
The only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is
the person most deprived of it: a dope-dealing teen from across the street
who is practically imprisoned by a domineering, bullying father. When
Lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again, the fact that he
has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in
exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the
family. Will Lester regain his ability to appreciate life? 
Opinion: 
People say it all the time: you never appreciate good health until it's
gone. Likewise, people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become
unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest, most inconsequential problems,
simply because they have no clue how good they have it. Sometimes it takes
a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out
of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world. The
deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of AMERICAN BEAUTY.
AMERICAN BEAUTY is a non-formula, intelligent and articulate movie that
offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast, especially Kevin
Spacey, who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie. The thing I like about
AMERICAN BEAUTY is that there is no sentimental music, no hospital scene
nor any overly dramatic hokum. The movie entertains and offers brilliant
performances just as is. 
If you are in the mood for a thoughtful, non-formula flick, I highly
recommend AMERICAN BEAUTY.

Title
Review for Next Stop Wonderland (1998)
Starring: Hope Davis, Alan Gelfant, Victor Argo, Cara Buono, Holland
Taylor, José Zúńiga, Robert Klein
Synopsis: 
NEXT STOP WONDERLAND is a pleasant, independent, romance movie which
explores the idea of fate in romantic searching. Basically, a gal and a
guy (who are unknown to each other) are fated to get together and become
soulmates, but they keep narrowly missing bumping into each other
throughout the movie, until guess what happens? 
The lady is a nurse named Erin (Hope Davis) whose activist boyfriend has
just left her. The man is a nice guy named Alan (Alan Gelfant) who is
burning the midnight oil studying to be a marine biologist, but comes
from a family business of plumbing. Both are attractive, middle class
types, living around the Boston area near the Wonderland train station.
The background music is soft and Brazilian.
Opinion:
If your romance life has ever gone down the tubes - - say, you've just
been dumped (or duped) by a potential boyfriend or girlfriend and end up
sitting alone in a theater watching a movie - - you'll understand the
humor and appeal of NEXT STOP WONDERLAND, which makes subtle
observations about people looking for love and advocates the notion that
fate has predestined a partner for us all. It's just a matter of
accidentally bumping into them on a train or something.
Unlike the tired formula of "girl meets boy; girl loses boy; destiny
throws them back together" NEXT STOP WONDERLAND  is an exploration of
the myriad coincidences and all the little near misses that happen
BEFORE the momentous "girl meets boy" in the first place.
Bucking this year's embarrassing trend of pairing old guys with romantic
partners less than half their age (Ernest Borgnine with Jenny McCarthy
in BASEKETBALL; Nicholson with Hunt, et cetera) instead of with normal
ladies, Hope Davis and Alan Gelfant do an excellent job as the people
who are oblivious to what fate has in store for them. In the movie she's
29 and he's 35.

Title
Review for Red Corner (1997)
Starring: Richard Gere, Bai Ling, Byron Mann, Jessey Meng
Ingredients: 
Beijing court, innocent Caucasian man, loyal female attorney
Synopsis:
Caucasian Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is at the People's Republic of China
to close a business deal with a high ranking Chinese partner involving
allowing American TV into the PRC; Jack is just about to close the deal.
That night he meets hot babe Hong Ling (Jessey Meng) and they go back to
his hotel room to get lucky. He is suddenly awakened by the police the
next morning, apparently framed for the murder of the beautiful woman. 
With the exception of one escape attempt, the rest of the movie is
mostly spent in the courtroom, listening to translated Chinese, where
clues and surprise witnesses come up. Moore is aided by a female
attorney (Bai Ling) who initially doesn't believe Moore but becomes his
loyal ally. Sometimes Moore reads off quotes from a Chinese law book.
Will their teamwork be enough to enable Moore to escape the messed up
criminal justice system?
Opinion: 
Red Corner doesn't contain much in the way of plot or suspense: a jailed
man waits a long time as a lot of evidence is presented.  This movie is
basically a character sketch of the corrupt justice system Moore must
suffer - - he gets about the same kind of justice you might expect from
a corrupt banana republic. But the ending is happy.
Says Director Jon Avnet, quoted on MGM/UA's Red Corner' Web Site:
"When I was in Beijing for a research trip and tried to take a still
photograph of the Beijing Intermediate Courthouse, I was accosted by two
soldiers with automatic weapons and persuaded not to continue my
photography."
"We shot Bai Ling riding a bicycle in Tiananmen Square at considerable
risk to her."
"There were people we met in Beijing who cared enough that we tell this
story accurately, that they were willing to risk retribution to give us
this information."
Historical Background of China and the Movies:
Coincidentally or not, Red Corner' opens as the real life presidential
summit between Chinese President Jiang and American President Bill
Clinton takes place in America. China is predicted by many to become the
world's largest economy next century, and this week's presidential
summit represents a warming of Sino-US ties.
The People's Republic of China contains approximately one fifth of all
the humans in the world. It became communist in 1949, after a civil war.
Meanwhile the defeated non-communist Chinese left the mainland and
exiled themselves to Taiwan to form their own government. Communist
China is now called the PRC (People's republic of China) while the
island of Taiwan prefers to call itself ROC (The Republic of China on
Taiwan) because it is controlled by its own separate government. The
Eisenhower administration in 1954 signed the U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense
Treaty which commits the US to protect Taiwan, ROC from communist
aggression.
Meanwhile, at China's western border China's military invasion of Tibet
occurred in 1950 resulting in the 1951 annexation of Tibet to China. A
Tibetan uprising in 1959 resulted in the Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama
fleeing to exile to India.
The relationship between the US and China began to thaw when President
Richard Nixon visited China in 1972. US and China signed the Shanghai
Communique, in which the U.S. drops political support for Taiwan and
"acknowledges that  there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of
China."  In 1978 Chinese leader Deng paved the way for capitalism to
exist in communist China; he placed profit incentives and economic
progress above traditional Maoist goals, visiting America in 1979. Soon
business put China back on the map; Mr. Deng's policies resulted in
today's high economic growth rate.
China's relationship with the States soured after the July 4, 1989
Tiananmen Square incident. Then in 1995 President Clinton's decision to
grant a visa to Taiwan President Lee enraged leaders of the PRC. This
was followed by the 1996 Taiwan Missile Crisis, where China held war
exercises and lobbed missiles around the waters surrounding Taiwan about
the same time as Taiwan's first democratic presidential elections - -
and the US responded by sending two aircraft carriers to the region.
This occurred against the backdrop of increasing trade relations between
the US and China. 
This week's presidential summit between Jiang and Clinton represents an
upswing in Sino-US ties and further travel up the long road to better
communication. 
A Warming Trend:
In terms of 1997 film, look for an increasing trend of China related
film this year and next year. Red Corner' actress Bai Ling, is a star
in her native China, and Red Corner' is her first starring role in an
American motion picture. Taiwanese director Ang Lee (The Ice Storm')
and Hong Kong director John Woo  (Face/Off') are notable examples of
Chinese directors active in mainstream Hollywood cinema, but their
movies this year do not deal with China themes. However, movies by other
directors do: for example, two movies on Tibet (Seven Years in Tibet,'
and Kundun') and one James Bond movie with a Chinese female partner
(Tomorrow Never Dies,' North American release date December 19) are
scheduled for North American release before this year ends. Acclaimed
Hong Kong fan favorite actor Chow Yun-Fat star in what I believe to be
his first major Hollywood film alongside Mira Sorvino in next year's
(February 1998 release date) Hollywood action thriller, The Replacement
Killers.'

Title
Review for American History X (1998)
Ingredients: neo-Nazi, redemption, legacy, family
Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong
Synopsis:
When Venice Beach high school student Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong)
becomes drawn to the neo-Nazi movement, the principal puts Danny in a
personal tutoring program whereby he must write about the life his older
brother Derek (Edward Norton), whom he idolizes. Through Danny's eyes,
AMERICAN HISTORY X tells the tale of how wayward brother Derek became
involved with the neo-Nazi movement, was sentenced to prison for a
shooting, served time, and faced the legacy of his mistakes.  
Opinion:
AMERICAN HISTORY X is a non-formula movie that approaches neo-Nazism
from a non-stereotypical view. It shows how seemingly average teens with
empty lives might get caught up in a racist social movement perpetrated
by demagogues with political ambitions.  Aside from redemption, another
central theme of AMERICAN HISTORY X is the concept of legacy. A man
might serve time in prison, but for both victims and aggressors, the
consequences of former actions continue. Although the pace of the film
somewhat uneven at times, and there is perhaps one unnecessary scene in
the last third of the movie, AMERICAN HISTORY X is an excellent family
drama that is well photographed and poignant as well as superbly acted.

Review for Wedding Singer, The (1998)
Starring: Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, Christine Taylor, Matthew Glave
Ingredients: 1980s setting, wedding musician, waitress, romance
Synopsis:
The story takes place in the 1980s but it could just as easily be any
typical Hollywood romantic comedy where boy meets girl, boy loses girl,
and they regain each other by the end. Robbie (Adam Sandler) is a down
and out musician who makes his living singing at weddings. After getting
left at the altar at his own wedding, Robbie's luck goes downhill until
he falls in love with his friend, a waitress named Julia (Drew
Barrymore). The two were made for each other. The trouble is, fair Julia
is engaged to unfaithful rich jerk Glen. At the same time, Robbie's
scummy old fiancee wants to get back together with him. Can Robbie and
Julia get past all the misunderstandings and find true love with each
other before Julia takes that plane to Vegas to marry Glen? 
Opinion: 
THE WEDDING SINGER is okay for a romantic comedy, with some dumb jokes
and some good ones, lots of chuckling at the 1980s decade, a good 'best
of the 80s' soundtrack, and a cameo by 80s rocker Billy Idol. Although
it is silly at times, and neither deep nor meaningful THE WEDDING SINGER
is big-hearted happy movie that any sucker for romance would love to
watch.

Title
Review for Armageddon (1998)
Starring: 
Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Peter
Stormare, Steve Buscemi, Seiko Matsuda
Ingredients: 
Large asteroid, crew of misfit oil drillers who become astronauts,
countdown timer with big green lights
Synopsis: 
In the beginning of ARMAGEDDON the voice of Charlton Heston explains
that long ago in the Cretaceous Period, a 6-mile chunk of asteroid
exterminated the world of the dinosaurs. When the rock struck, its
instant vaporization threw so much dust and gas into the atmosphere that
the sun was blocked long enough to kill off most plants and animals. In
ARMAGEDDON a new rock - - this time 'the size of Texas' - - is poised to
collide with the Earth. American heroes must save the world from certain
disaster while the helpless international community follows the American
heroes' exploits with awe and adoration.
Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his hell-raising crew of eccentric oil
drillers are considered the best drillers in the world. Dan Truman
(Billy Bob Thornton) as head of NASA recruits Stamper and the oilers for
a mission to save humanity from extinction. NASA divides the oilers into
two mission teams: one led by Stamper and the other led by Stamper's
daughter's boyfriend AJ (Ben Affleck), a rival who doesn't get along
with Stamper. Each team gets a mobile drilling rig, a space shuttle, and
a nuclear bomb. Using Earthbound shuttles as space rockets, each team
must slingshot around the moon, reach the giant asteroid, and drill 800
feet into it the asteroid in order to plant and explode a nuclear device
- - so that hopefully the asteroid will be split into pieces and avoid
colliding with Earth. Only one nuclear device is needed for success but
the two rival teams are sent simultaneously to preclude failure.
On the mission, Stamper and the boys face perils such as the asteroid's
selective gravity. Two-ton space vehicles containing crew members are in
danger of floating off into free space. At the same time, two-ton rocks
might crush the men as the boulders fall with resounding thuds on the
airless asteroid's surface. Also, somebody has thoughtlessly equipped
the mobile drilling rigs with Gatling machine guns. 
Liv Tyler plays Stamper's daughter (and AJ's girlfriend) Grace, a pretty
face who waits helplessly on Earth. There are also bits involving
stereotyped minorities such as the chatterbox African American who
shrieks in surprise, the overweight Samoan hit by a meteor, and the
Asian couple who applaud Stamper when their faces get splattered with
black oil. Japanese superstar entertainer Seiko Matsuda gets all of two
seconds as an oblivious tourist who declares that she wants to go
shopping during a meteor shower.
Can Stamper and the oil drilling guys save humanity from certain
destruction?
Opinion:
Speaking of doom, a New Age friend told me her theory about why DEEP
IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON came out this summer. She says a 16th century
doom-and-gloom prophet named Nostradamus wrote that a terror would fall
from the sky next year "in the seventh month of 1999." Which could mean
anything from a slingshot crash of NASA's plutonium-laden Cassini Probe
to a terrorist on a parachute, if you believe in that sort of thing. But
in Hollywood, it amounts to little more than coffee shop inspiration for
summer asteroid movies such as DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON.
Getting back to ARMAGEDDON, it seems like there's a scene missing. In
the movie, as time runs short, the crew led by AJ has a perfect
opportunity to wake up, unpack their gear, start digging, plant their
nuclear bomb, and save the Earth (and its 6 billion people). Instead,
they go driving around the asteroid with the mobile drilling rig - -
inexplicably wasting precious time sightseeing when the Earth (including
AJ's girlfriend) is in immediate and dire jeopardy. Is AJ's nuke
completely forgotten as a viable option in his mission? 
At its heart ARMAGEDDON is mostly a rehash of stuff we've already seen
before in other uninspiring movies. But at least the mediocre doomsday
script is spiced up with implausible events (such as Gatling guns) to
increase the number of booms and bangs. 
The cinematography in ARMAGEDDON is noteworthy in that for two hours and
30 minutes the audience is hit with a dizzying mishmash of photographic
angles nearly every second. Meanwhile, in the background music,
suspenseful drumming goes on and on and on. All this changing scenery
and ominous drumming is illusory fluff - - an obvious attempt to make it
seem like something interesting is always about to happen. But the
continuous images hold interest for only about an hour, then diminish in
impact as nothing substantial really happens. On the other hand, being
distracted from ARMAGEDDON's implausible plot while waiting for the
ending to roll around might not be a bad thing. 
In short, ARMAGEDDON consists of a few booms, a few bangs, lots of
distracting images, and a period of waiting around for a possibly happy
ending.
Trivia (Sci Fi fans only): 
After the movie I wondered whether in reality we Americans would be able
to use nukes to fend off a space rock the size of Texas (i.e. over a
quarter million square miles), and found out that astronomers have
actually done simulations. In the computer simulations using the rough
equivalent of an atom bomb planted in an asteroid only a mile in size,
the asteroid cracked up, but the pieces stayed on course to wipe out the
Earth. 
One thing that's always bugged me about sci fi movies is the use of
rockets, which somehow seem kind of low tech, since rockets waste vast
amounts of fuel and then run out. But in order to travel such vast
distances, interstellar travel would require establishing a propulsion
force that, unlike rocketry, doesn't use up much fuel.
For example, when you drop a penny, it experiences a force which pulls
it in the direction of earth. This is because the penny is within a
gravitational field which propels the penny towards Earth, without
having to burn fuel. If the gravitational field pointed sideways, the
penny would fall sideways. If the field pointed up, the penny would fall
up. The penny always falls in the direction of the field, without having
to burn fuel. Field is the key.
Field effect propulsion is perfect for sci fi space travel. Basically,
in order to create a propulsive force to drive a spaceship in any
direction without the use of fuel, all you have to do is establish a
ship with its own field. Point the field in the direction you want to
go, and you continue to "fall" in that direction forever. Point it in a
different direction, and there you go. 
Has the principle of field effect propulsion been demonstrated before in
real life? Certainly. It's known as the Biefeld Brown effect, a weak
phenomenon first observed by physicist/astronomer Dr. Paul Alfred
Biefeld as early as 1923. Biefeld created a strong electrostatic field
in a simple capacitor (a capacitor is a sandwich made of two metal
plates and gook in between) - - and the capacitor always levitated
weakly towards the direction stipulated by its generated field. That was
over seventy five years ago, in 1923, before big budgets and modern
materials. Just imagine the kind of field effect propulsion we could
achieve in a 1998 science fiction movie (or in real life using the
movie's budget).
Most recently, in 1992 Dr Eugene Podkletnov of Tampere University,
Finland published a paper describing research in which he using a
special ceramic disk to produce a field in the direction opposing
gravity. When non-metal and non-magnetic materials were placed within
the field directly above the flat disk, he recorded up to a 2%
cancellation of gravity. Presently Dr Ning Li of the University of
Alabama, Huntsville, along with NASA's Marshall Manned Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Alabama, are working on a similar device. Go,
NASA.
It seems to me, that if science fiction is supposed to portray imaginary
high tech space propulsion, field effect is the way to go.

Review for Deep Impact (1998)
Written by: Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin
Starring: Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Robert Duvall
Synopsis: 
This human interest story features a big tidal wave in the last few
minutes. There are three sets of main characters, each with their own
issues:
1.  A teenage boy named Leo (Elijah Wood) who has discovered a comet
must find a way to proclaim his love to a girl.
2.  An American lady reporter named Jenny (Tea Leoni) whose career was
made by the comet story must get over her European father's remarriage.
3.  A retired ace astronaut named Fish (Robert Duvall) must get his
younger comrades to socially accept him as they fly a rocket to the
comet.
Once the main characters definitively resolve these personal issues,
they turn their main attention to the prospect of a giant comet hurtling
towards the earth. Then comet gets focused on for a few last minutes and
the movie ends with a presidential speech. 
Opinion:
When disaster strikes in a 'disaster' movie, the injustice of it is that
heroes are too young to die because they have big unresolved issues to
deal with - - like redemption or finding a lost loved one. Then the
catastrophe strikes them, making everything that much harder and more
dramatic to deal with. This is the TITANIC formula.
On the other hand, suppose you have a disaster movie where the heroes
have already finished finding their love or have already achieved
redemption before the calamity even strikes. Then the subsequent
disaster is merely academic, something entertaining and touristy to be
viewed with no real emotional investment. 
In DEEP IMPACT main characters wrestle their way through human dilemmas
like teen love and dealing with divorce and finish up. The main focus on
the comet appears at the end, rather extraneously, neither punctuating
nor aggravating human issues that have already been solved adequately.
In terms of drama, it's an add-on. And so, paradoxically, by the end of
the movie the dramatic disaster angle neither impacts nor is deep.
Decent acting and good special effects can be found here, but I think
the script could be stronger if the issues were timed so that the comet
impacted all of the main characters in a more physical way throughout
the entire movie, rather than just at the ending. 
On the other hand, DEEP IMPACT remains an adequate movie. It is
well-acted, it entertains, and even amazes, despite its depersonalized
disaster.

Review for Wild Wild West (1999)
Written by: Written by S.S. Wilson, Brent Maddock, Jeffrey Price and Peter
S. Seaman
Starring: Will Smith, Kevin Kline, Salma Hayek, and Kenneth Branagh
Synopsis: 
Will Smith plays James West and Kevin Kline is Artemus Gordon in this 1999
movie based on the 1965-70 television adventure/spy series about two 1860s
cowboy secret agents. 
West attends a party and soon finds himself in trouble. "Sorry I made the
mistake of drumming on a white woman's breasts," says West. Meanwhile
Gordon falls for a saloon girl named Rita (Salma Hayek) whose father has
been kidnapped. "She's a breath of fresh ass, I mean a breast of fresh
air," the love-smitten Gordon remarks. The kidnapper, a scientist named Dr.
Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh), is wheelchair-bound, a condition which
gives West ample comedic ammunition for emasculation and shortness jokes.
As West, Gordon and Rita give chase Loveless plots to dismantle America and
give most of it to European colonialist rulers. 
Opinion:
These days I often hear the WILD WILD WEST song played on MTV. It sounds
like an old Stevie Wonder tune with all the same chords but they changed
the words and now it's WILD WILD WEST. The song makes a pretty catchy
advertisement for the movie. 
WILD WILD WEST (1999) shows how agents West and Gordon first meet and
become partners. Usually in cop buddy movies new partners develop a close
bond after some initial friction. Unfortunately, in WILD WILD WEST
chemistry between West and Gordon never seems to develop. James West has
initial misgivings about technology and develops a bond with it, but he
doesn't seem to like Gordon any more or any less by the end of the movie.
West is a Civil War Era African American and Gordon is a white stranger,
but the whole relationship aspect seems unexplored.
On the other hand, it's supposed to be escapist fantasy. WILD WILD WEST is
the kind of movie where they spend a fortune on special effects but blunder
on the details. A bad guy gets electrocuted with a big wrench. I didn't see
any batteries or wires. West plucks a flattened bullet from the INSIDE of
his bulletproof vest rather than the OUTSIDE. Huh? Loveless captures Rita
and threatens to use her for his pleasure, but Loveless has already had the
lower half of his body chopped off. And so on.
Given a choice between hearing the MTV song or watching the movie, I take
the song.

Title
Review for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation (1997)
Screenplay written by: Brent Friedman and Bryce Zabel (original story
written by Lawrence Kasanoff, Joshua Wexler, and John Tobias).
Starring: Robin Shou, Taliso Soto, James Remar, Sandra Hess, Lynn "Red"
Williams
Synopsis:
This is not a sentimental movie, a 'date' movie, or a thriller. It's the
sequel to Mortal Kombat,' a 1995 movie based on a popular video game.
In the original Mortal Kombat' an immortal named Lord Rayden chose
three heroes - -  nice Hong Kong guy Liu Kang, SWAT team leader Sonya
Blade, and movie star Johnny Cage - - to represent the planet earth in a
high stakes interdimensional martial arts tournament called Mortal
Kombat. Talisa Soto played Kitana, the princess from another dimension
who helped the heroes succeed. In this sequel, Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation,' no sooner do the victorious heroes return to earth with
their friend Princess Kitana than another crisis presents itself. 
Shao-Kahn, the evil emperor of Outworld, has hatched a plot to kill Lord
Rayden and the heroes, and take over the earth by merging it with
another dimension.  Shao-Kahn kills Johnny, captures Kitana to set a
death trap for the heroes, and then sets about destroying the earth with
rocket-launching techno-ninjas, a zombified queen, a centaur creature,
scorpion monsters, martial arts armies, and evil siblings. Meanwhile the
heroes enlist the aid of Sonya Blade's old SWAT team pal Jax, and start
kicking booty. Will good triumph over evil?
Opinion: 
This is the kind of movie that adolescent guys will love. If you liked
the first Mortal Kombat,' with it's hyperactive high-kicking male and
female leads, you'll like this movie, which emphasizes state-of-the-art
special effects, great fight photography, and martial arts choreography,
and de-emphasizes a confusing mythic plot. The visual "oomph" emphasis
is probably due to that fact that director John Leonetti is best known
for photography - - he was the director of photography on The Mask' and
on Mortal Kombat,' while his brother Matthew shot Star Trek: First
Contact.' Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' uses an eclectic blend of fresh
fight choreography from a number of different fighting arts involving
plenty of aerial kicks and trampoline-style spinning jumps. The CG
(computer generated) characters manage to do decent fight scenes as
well. In other words, this movie puts American fight choreography up
there with Hong Kong wu shu. For Asian-Americans and for Hollywood,
Mortal Kombat: Annihilation' will be a test of how willing the American
public is to pay money to view an Asian movie protagonist. Producer
Larry Kasanoff, who also produced  Terminator 2' is producing this
film.
Stars: 
Robin Shou, the leading man in Mortal Kombat' and Mortal Kombat:
Annihiliation' was born in Hong Kong but moved to Los Angeles at age
eleven and obtained a degree in civil engineering from CSU Los Angeles.
He worked for a year and half as a soil engineer, but eventually moved
to Hong Kong, became a movie stuntman, and finally worked his way into
playing villains. After nine years of Hong Kong movies, he went to a
friend's barbecue in California and met an agent, who suggested that
Robin audition for Mortal Kombat.' Robin's martial arts style is wu
shu, a cinematic mixture of martial arts forms and dramatic
presentation. As a college he became so excited about wushu that he sold
his car and skipped a quarter of school to fly to China and study it.
Model-turned-actress Talisa Soto is best known for playing James Bond
Girl Lupe Lamora in License to Kill.' To my knowledge she is the first
Hispanic Bond Girl.

Title
Review for Dick (1999)
Written by: Andrew Fleming and Sheryl Longin
Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Michelle Williams, Dan Hedaya, Dave Foley
Synopsis: 
Tricky Dick Nixon (Richard M. Nixon), the 37th President of the United
States, was famous for a few things and infamous for one. Nixon ended the
Vietnam War and held successful strategic arms limitation talks with his
Cold War nemesis, Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. But soon came the 1972
Watergate office complex break-in, an attempted burglary and wiretapping of
the Democratic National Committee headquarters by thugs hired by Nixon's
close associates. In the end, President Nixon resigned in disgrace after
erasing tapes which allegedly contained conversations in which he
obstructed justice by halting the FBI's Watergate investigation just when
big names were starting to become implicated.
The spoof DICK is a caricature of the Nixon years in which the Nixon
administration's main accomplishments are accidentally caused by two ditsy
teenage girls named Arlene and Betsy (played by Michelle Williams and
Kirsten Dunst) who are hired by the White House as dog walkers. 
In DICK, Nixon (Dan Hedaya) thoughtlessly erases the tapes which lead to
his resignation because he doesn't want the world to hear Arlene singing an
embarrassing Olivia Newton-John love song. Another running gag is that
Nixon has a dog named King Timahoe, but he keeps absent-mindedly calling
the dog Checkers, the name of a pet Nixon immortalized in a political
speech, defending himself from charges of corruption 20 years before
Watergate. Nixon era characters such as Leonid Brezhnev and Henry Kissinger
are also spoofed.
Opinion: 
DICK is great satire, a hilarious take on the Nixon years. Even folks who
weren't born in the days of Tricky Dick, Kissinger, Liddy, Dean, or
Haldeman will still laugh at bigwig politicians eating the wrong
(marijuana-laced) cookies. Or at the two oblivious teens - - Betsy and
Arlene, like Jan and Marcia from the Brady Brunch, only mentally vacuous -
- who witness surreptitious corruption time and again but fail to see
what's going on. While nefarious events swirl, Arlene and Betsy dream of
only cute 70s pop idol Bobby Sherman and the furtive man of their dreams,
Richard Nixon.  
Comedic parts concerning investigative reporters Woodward and Bernstein
fall flat, and some of the film's jokes are inside jokes, but for the most
part DICK is pretty funny. And the DICK soundtrack includes everything 70s,
from young Michael Jackson to Yes.

Title
Review for Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)
Starring: Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Natalie Portman
Synopsis:
In Phantom Menace the galaxy is divided into power groups whose interests
will inevitably collide in later sequels. There is an overarching galactic
United Nations-type organization called the Senate presided by a weak
Chancellor. Within the senate two camps are at odds: a bickering,
isolationist alliance called the Republic and their aggressive rival the
Trade Federation. Preserving law and order are a council of Jedi Knights
who are meanwhile searching for a prophesied chosen one of virgin birth.
Manipulating events behind the scenes is a dangerous, reemerging clan
called the Dark Lords of Sith, so shadowy and secretive that they comprise
a "phantom" menace.
Jedi knight Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi
(Ewan McGregor) witness an invasion of teenage Queen Amidala's home planet
Naboo and befriend a Gungan named Jar Jar (Ahmed Best). On the desert
planet of Tatooine the two Jedi, Jar Jar, and Amidala (Natalie Portman)
attend a lengthy drag race involving the young boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake
Lloyd). The five protagonists try to solicit help for freeing Naboo by
visiting the city planet of Coruscant where a lot of debate and political
maneuvering takes place. Can they free Amidala's helpless planet?
Opinion:
On TV last night I watched young, wannabe celebs pay $400 a ticket and come
running out of theaters to bask in front of news cameras, gushing with
testimonials of The Phantom Menace's greatness in exchange for a few
seconds of being on national television. Given this kind of media mania I
wondered if Phantom Menace, the most anticipated movie of 1999, could
possibly live up to the extraordinary hype that preceded it. Does Phantom
Menace match the exaggerated hype? Director George Lucas answers, "It's
only a movie." 
To me, any movie with Russian-sounding accents for bad guys, Jamaican
accents for good guys, and Middle Eastern-sounding accents for seedy
gamblers accents can be expected to be more tongue in cheek than profound.
Visually, Star Wars: Episode I --The Phantom Menace (1999) is a kid show
where parents can take their young ones to marvel at child-friendly CGI
characters and wondrous backdrops even if the character dialogue (mostly
geopolitics) is beyond the level of children. It is left to parents to
patiently explain the conversation: droid origins, family lineage, the
definitions of terms like blockade, appeasement, federation, alliance,
symbiosis, satellite-controlled robots et cetera. At least this much is
clear: there's plenty of eye candy, and in the last few minutes it's good
guys and Joe Camel lookalikes versus a caped, horned red devil character
and his mechanical hordes.
Weaknesses:
Weaknesses lie in the writing and in the performance. At first it seems
like the film is to be an invasion story, but then Phantom takes an
hour-long detour to cover one chariot race before returning to the invasion
theme. This dilutes the central story. Additionally, smaller scenes seem
written self consciously, as if they were added more to fill us in on
extraneous background information for other movies rather than form an
integral part of the present movie. Veteran actors Liam Neeson and Ewan
McGregor noticeably outperform the other acting leads. Better ensemble
chemistry between the five leads and background information that is central
to a tight story line could have made have given Phantom stronger
performances and storytelling punch.
Strengths:
On the bright side Phantom Menace as a big-budget production is far ahead
of the competition in terms of making whimsical creatures, worlds and
vehicles appear real. The film boasts sophisticated, top-of-the-line
visuals and quality exotic costumes, a musical score entertaining enough to
stand alone, and three worthwhile sequences in the second half. 
Bottom line? Seeing the film is entertaining and informative, like a visual
theme park with Star Wars filler information serving as dialogue between
impressive money shots. We are bound to be completely inundated by Star
Wars publicity, music and tie-ins for the next few months.

Title
Review for L.A. Confidential (1997)
Starring: 
Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell,
David Strathaim, and Danny DeVito
Ingredients: 1950s Los Angeles; femme fatale; ambitious but naďve
detective; corruption; big complicated city; politics; would be actors
and actresses lured by tinsel town only to become hookers; darkness,
mazes and layers of events left unresolved until the end
Synopsis:
This noir drama portrays the coming of age of two opposing young cops in
1950s Los Angeles (a place where corruption in the law enforcement
system is the rule rather than the exception). Australian actor Guy
Pearce plays naďvely honest young L.A. policeman Ed Exley who is
ambitious for advancement, while fellow Australian Russell Crowe plays
his moral and physical opposite, Bud White, a complex macho cop who does
what he is told (which in 1950s L.A. means turning a blind eye to
racism, planting evidence, and police brutality). Scrawny Exley is
politically motivated but idealistic about the treatment of suspects and
wants to buck the system, while White follows orders because he wants to
see criminals physically abused since his mother was beaten and murdered
by his father when he was a child. Kevin Spacey plays a third
protagonist, jaded celebrity cop Jack Vincennes, who advises a schmaltzy
TV show called Badge of Honor.' On the take, Vincennes has forgotten
the idealism which had originally caused him to join the force.
The movie's first big event features a police brutality scene against
Mexican-Americans in order to showcase the corruption of the era, the
personalities of the three cops, and how they despise each other.  In
the meantime, mobsters are being murdered, and not long afterwards a
retired cop and five victims are massacred at the Nite Owl Café. The
murder is solved, and the apparent perpetrators are gunned down by the
police. Over time and for separate reasons each of the three
protagonists is drawn by events in their own lives to reinvestigate
different aspects of the supposedly solved' case. The main mob boss
Mickey Cohen is in prison. So who could be responsible for the recent
spate of murders of mobsters and retired corrupt cops in California and
why? The answer changes both Exley and White. 
Other subplots involve a missing stash of heroin, a sleazy tabloid
editor who pays and gets paid to set people up to commit crimes and
subsequently take the fall, and the rivalry between two cops for the
affections of a beautiful celebrity lookalike hooker (Kim Basinger).
L.A. Confidential is the Warner Brothers movie adaptation of author
James Ellroy's book. 
Opinion:
Be careful you don't pause in the middle of the movie to go to the
drinking fountain. If you miss just one small word of the last scene
where Exley explains the situation, this movie is so intricate you might
lose your place.
The story is good and rich with overlapping themes, characters, and plot
strands that seem unrelated at first but tie together somewhat
successfully by the movie's end. In addition characters change
orientation from more corrupt to less or from less corrupt to more,
depending on the character and his stomach for the events that unfold.
In other words this Warner Brothers movie adaptation of James Ellroy's
novel is just as deep and engrossing as the book. 
In terms of action, all the gunfights are good, including the big battle
at the end. But there's a definite snag in the movie's pace after the
Nite Owl case is solved when it seems like characters are not strongly
motivated to do anything until the Nite Owl case starts being
reinvestigated. A subplot about heroin remains confusing even after the
movie ends.
All of the actors and actresses in this film did an absolutely marvelous
job in fleshing out their onscreen characters. Russell Crow shines as
the macho cop.

Title
Review for Mystery Men (1999)
Starring: William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria, Paul
Reubens, Kel Mitchell, Greg Kinnear, Geoffrey Rush, Wes Studi, Claire Forlani
Synopsis: 
In this superhero spoof a team of seven inept wannabe heroes get their
chance to save "Champion City" when too-perfect resident superhero Captain
Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is captured by a mad scientist (Geoffrey Rush). The
bumbling "heroes" are: Mr. Furious, The Shoveler, The Bowler, The Blue
Raja, The Spleen, Invisible Boy, and The Sphinx, played by Ben Stiller,
William H. Macy, Janeane Garofalo, Hank Azaria, Paul Reubens, Kel Mitchell,
and Wes Studi, respectively. 
Mr. Furious is powered by "boundless rage." The Shoveler is a master at
shoveling. The Bowler argues with her father's skull, which is embedded in
a magical bowling ball. The Blue Raja wears entirely green clothing and is
a master at throwing forks. The Spleen was cursed by an old Gypsy woman to
become a creature of pure flatulence. Invisible Boy thinks he's invisible
when no one is looking. And the Sphinx spouts awful puns. 
Opinion:
The heroes know where the bad guy lives. The bad guy knows where the heroes
hang out. From then it's just a matter of try, try, again, assaulting the
bad guy's lair throughout a number of bungled battles. Guess who wins the
last battle after the obligatory girlfriend capture? Sometimes going
overboard, MYSTERY MEN has fun with itself, satirizing the superhero genre
enough to keep the audience either snickering or groaning throughout the film.

Title
Review for Runaway Bride (1999)
Written by: Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott
Starring: Julia Roberts, Richard Gere
Synopsis: 
Small town bride Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) has been nicknamed the
runaway bride for leaving various men stranded at the altar. On three
different occasions Maggie has gotten cold feet and dumped the groom by
running away in the middle of the wedding ceremony. Because she's too used
to playing along rather than asserting what she really wants Maggie just
can't make the big commitment.
When cynical USA Today columnist Ike Graham (Richard Gere) blows into town
to cover Maggie's fourth wedding attempt and write a nasty article, he ends
up falling in love with Maggie. 
Opinion: 
After nine years PRETTY WOMAN director Garry Marshall and stars Roberts and
Gere are reunited for another romance, apparently in the hopes they'll cash
in on the PRETTY WOMAN nostalgia crowd. While RUNAWAY BRIDE does provide
the nostalgia of seeing Roberts and Gere reunited in romance, it lacks two
key ingredients: warmth and conviction.
As city slicker Ike Graham, Gere is condescending to the rural folk,
treating all townspeople like idiots to be easily swindled and charmed. The
townspeople actually vindicate this view by acting like rubes, dolts and
alcoholics, especially during the pre-wedding dinner. RUNAWAY BRIDE's
portrayal of rural people as self-absorbed, unintelligent, or drunk never
wavers, and this is how the film loses charm.
The token characters that Roberts and Gere play aren't written with
conviction. Maggie says her basic problem is that she is unable to assert
her individualism. But how come in her spare time she kickboxes and creates
unique art? Similarly, Ike Graham is supposed to be from New York, but his
New York accent occasionally vanishes.
RUNAWAY BRIDE is an okay movie for taking the wife or girlfriend because it
is a paint-by-numbers romance, because crowd favorites Roberts and Gere are
easy protagonists to cheer for, and because the movie contains at least one
great commercial for Federal Express. But if you hate predictable movies
you'd better buy yourself a big cup of coffee.

Title
Review for Mask of Zorro, The (1998)
Written by: 
John Eskow, Terry Rossio, and Ted Elliott. The character Zorro first
appeared in Johnston McCulley's serialized 1919 pulp fiction novel THE
CURSE OF THE CAPISTRANO. 
Synopsis:
The story takes place in 1800s California, then a part of Mexico. A
haggard but aristocratic martial arts master named Don Diego (Anthony
Hopkins) used to be the sly swashbuckling sword fighting superhero named
Zorro ("fox" in Spanish). After 20 years of languishing in an awful
prison the nobleman Don Diego finally escapes only to find out that his
infant daughter Elena, now a beautiful young woman (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), has been raised by his mortal enemy Don Rafael (Stuart
Wilson). Elena wrongly believes that she is Rafael's daughter, when in
fact Rafael murdered Elena's mother, Don Diego's wife.
Realizing that he is too old to destroy Don Rafael alone, Don Diego
trains a young bandit named Alejandro to inherit his superhero legacy
(the mask of Zorro), a job description which entails championing the
poor and sending corrupt colonial aristocrats scurrying fearfully back
to their haciendas with their tails between their legs - - through the
use of superior swordsmanship, horsemanship, and the whip. 
Similar to a James Bond movie, Alejandro/Zorro romances the bad guy's
girl, invades the rich guy's party, sneaks into the compound at night to
tangle with guards, gets into a stunt-filled chase (with horses), and
discovers how the bad guy plans to get the gold and take power. THE MASK
OF ZORRO even ends with a pop theme song. The difference is, James Bond
normally discovers the bad guy's master plan after getting captured and
tied up with the heroine, but Alejandro/Zorro does not. Also, James Bond
takes place in modern times, while the setting of THE MASK OF ZORRO is
colonial Mexico.
Will swashbucklers Don Diego and Alejandro save the girl and thwart Don
Rafael's greedy, power-hungry plan?
Opinion:
Zorro is a  character similar to both Robin Hood and Batman. Like Robin
Hood, Zorro champions the oppressed poor in a bygone era ruled by the
greedy rich. Like the popular Batman (or the earlier Scarlet Pimpernel),
Zorro has a secret identity whereby he poses as an affable aristocrat by
day but avenges injustice by night. Laughing at the thrill of danger,
Zorro shames the bad guys by defeating them and scratching big
embarrassing Zs onto their skin with his sword. 
When I was a kid, my siblings and I used to play Zorro with kite sticks
all the time. As a Zorro fan from way back, I find THE MASK OF ZORRO
enjoyable because it seamlessly weaves together action, romance, and
drama. Banderas in particular is excellent with the blade. His charm and
skillful swordplay, along with a more awkward slight tendency to slouch
and sideways forward roll, make him completely believable as a
Zorro-in-training. The other characters are good as well, from the sexy
but innocent Zeta-Jones to the elegant but out-of-breath Hopkins as the
paunchy, graying master. Aside from the dashing swordplay, an extra
choreography treat involves a tango-like ballroom sequence between the
dashing Alejandro and a passionate Elena. 
In THE MASK OF ZORRO attention to detail can be found in every facet of
the film, from the crisp, flamenco-style music and Spanish guitar, to
the period scenery, and design of the swords. The man responsible for
the excellent sword choreography in THE MASK OF ZORRO is swordsman Bob
Anderson. Anderson, who has been a swordmaster in Hollywood films for 45
years, is the man inside the Darth Vader costume in the STAR WARS movies
sword duels. He was also responsible, as swordmaster, for the exquisite
THE PRINCESS BRIDE and HIGHLANDER battles. Livestock coordinator Corky
Randall should also be commended for the detailed chase scenes and
horsemanship stunts in THE MASK OF ZORRO. 
The beginning of THE MASK OF ZORRO and the end of the film are very
exciting. THE MASK OF ZORRO comes very close to being a fantastic,
sweeping epic, but the middle sags slightly because the part where the
good guy stumbles upon the bad guy's master plan seems a bit stretched
out. In the middle - - for all Zorro's climbing around and detective
work - - he finds out that politician Don Rafael's earthshakingly evil
master scheme is to merely to make California an independent country by
purchasing it from Mexico. That doesn't seem like much of an evil idea,
considering that today the state of California's economy is larger than
that of every country in the world but five. So, as far as nefarious
master schemes go, Californian independence is too tame. Only twenty
minutes later, when Don Rafael decides to mercilessly kill off
imprisoned slaves, does the situation get dire enough to propel ZORRO.
This extra time causes the middle to appear stretched. But soon the
action starts back up again. Once the blades start flashing and the
protagonists rush to the rescue, all is well.

Title
Review for Paulie (1998)
Starring: Jay Mohr, Hallie Kate Eisenberg, Tony Shalhoub, Cheech Marin,
Trini Alvarado
Ingredients: lost parrot trying to get home, friends
Synopsis: 
A Russian janitor named Misha (Tony Shalhoub) discovers a little old
parrot languishing in the basement of a science research facility.
"Paulie the talking parrot" (the voice of Jay Mohr) soon regales Misha
with his life story. 
As a young bird Paulie is raised by Marie (Hallie Kate Eisenberg ), a
little girl with a speech impediment. By attending Marie's speech
lessons, Paulie learns to act/speak like a regular person.
Unfortunately, after being unfairly blamed for an accident, Paulie is
taken to a pawn shop and sold. 
Paulie's biggest wish is to return to Marie. Many years later, and after
a succession of memorable owners (Gena Rowlands, Cheech Marin, and Jay
Mohr), Paulie falls in with a bad crowd and is apprehended in Los
Angeles trying to steal jewelry. He is sent to a cruel research
facility, where he refuses to participate and is imprisoned the
basement. 
Will Misha help Paulie get back to Marie?
Opinion:
Every time people watch movies that portray animals as beings with cute
human personalities, some well-meaning audience members go out next
Christmas or birthday and buy a Dalmatian or whatever creature is
currently popular. Soon enough, "birthday kid" loses interest and the
purchased pup ends up at the local pound, a victim of neglect. 
My sister owns a real PAULIE: it thinks like a parrot, bites like a
parrot, and requires as much attention as a newborn human infant. Please
think twice before buying one. 
Okay. Back to the story. In movies, parrots usually play support
characters, but PAULIE might be the first movie where the (animatronic)
bird gets main billing. Paulie, like those side characters in Disney
cartoons, is cute and sassy, a strutting, miniature human. Actually,
Paulie is the voice of Jay Mohr (he played Jennifer Aniston's boyfriend
on PICTURE PERFECT) doing his best Buddy Hackett impression (which is
interesting, since Hackett himself cameos as the pawn shop owner, and
Mohr doubles as a customer).
PAULIE is for kids. While watching PAULIE you hear little tykes in the
theater laughing hysterically when Paulie calls the cat a "stupid
furball."  Sometimes, however, there are statements the kids don't get.
For example, when Paulie's elderly owner Ivy (Gena Rowlands) dies,
Paulie explains, "Well, one day, the cat got her." And you hear kids
exclaim, "What cat?!" 
Imagine LASSIE COME HOME, except with a doll-sized human dressed as a
bird, and you'll have a good idea of the plot and characterization. Bird
tries to get home. Bird meets elderly friend. Bird loses elderly friend.
Bird meets eccentric friend. Bird loses eccentric friend. Bird meets bad
influence. And so on and so forth, with Paulie meeting friends and
saying goodbye at a meandering pace until he finally makes it back to
Marie (Trini Alvarado). 
The bottom line? Break out the popcorn money, Moms and Dads. PAULIE may
be the low end version of LASSIE, BAMBI, or BABE, but he'll do.
Sometimes the wisecracks go over their heads, but I'm sure youngsters
can appreciate a story about a little person (Paulie) trying to get
home, meeting friends and experiencing moral lessons on the way. 
And good luck explaining what it means when Paulie says of Ivy, "Well,
one day, the cat got her."

Title
Review for Horse Whisperer, The (1998)
Written by: Michael Tolkin and Bruce Joel Rubin, from the novel by
Nicholas Evans
Starring: Robert Redford, Kristin Scott Thomas, Scarlett Johansson, Sam
Neill
Ingredients: Traumatized girl and horse, magazine editor mother, animal
psychologist cowboy, lawyer dad
Synopsis: 
In big city Manhattan, a girl named Grace (Scarlett Johansson) has
teenage angst ("Who is ever going to want me now!?). Her mother Annie, a
magazine editor (Kristin Scott Thomas), is too tightly wound and bored
("The layout is too perfect. I'm bored. Do it over!"). Meanwhile Dad
Robert (Sam Neill) fears an unequal relationship with Mom ("I always
knew I loved you more than you loved me!"). When Grace and the horse get
into an accident, it sets up a situation where Mom, Grace, and the horse
must stay at the Montana ranch of the lonely horse specialist Tom Booker
(Robert Redford) and his extended family. Booker is a horse whisperer
(horse psychologist).
But the real star of this drama is the state of Montana, portrayed as an
idyllic, magical place of healing and family values. Will the horse, the
girl, the dad, and the mom get healed by their contact with nature?
Opinion:
Although the advertisements have tried to portray this film as the next
BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY (and a romance subplot does begin to develop
after the first hour and a half has passed), THE HORSE WHISPERER is
really mainly about healing under the beautiful auspices of the
storybook Montana countryside. 
Understandably, cinematography plays a huge role in THE HORSE WHISPERER,
and it is done well here. You'll see it all: bold skies and deep
sunsets, snowfall, aerial shots, lots of close ups of eyes (the window
to the soul), and even the meticulous laying down of Dad's silver
cufflinks, one by one. 
Characterization is also good. Even the horse does a good job. Each of
the characters is deep, with hidden secrets. 
As far as acting is concerned, Kristin Scott Thomas basically carries
the film; she's in nearly every single scene, and dialogue by other
characters is minimal, though the scenes are well acted. The chemistry
between Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Redford is suspicious because
Annie MacLean is an uptight, hyperactive woman, while Redford as Tom
Booker is a mystical minimalist, but the plot explains that Booker
hasn't seen a woman for a while after his divorce.
One technique that doesn't work so well is something I call dialogue
after the fact. For example, the camera focuses seductively on lonely
Robert Redford hungrily reacting to the sight of Kristin Scott Thomas'
swinging legs during the first hour of THE HORSE WHISPERER, but in one
later scene he unexpectedly blurts out, "Don't you ever sit still?" Or
throughout the entire movie teenage Grace never looks in a mirror, never
wears make up, or eye-catching clothing, but she burst into tears and
cries to her mother that no boys will like her as a handicapped person.
Similarly, when the seemingly successful lawyer Dad visits Mom in
Montana, he makes the unexpected confession that he never thought he was
good enough for her. As the movie meanders about Montana, with mother
nature moving at her own gentle pace, the characters make sudden
confessions that seem to revise the history of earlier events. The idea
here, is that nature is a magical place that causes the repressed
insecurities of city folk to be drawn out and healed - - and that
contact with the horse whisperer, a natural man, acts as the catalyst to
liberation.
Although too much script emphasis is placed on the Mom character, and it
can also get a bit tedious watching nature all the time, there is enough
great cinematography, good acting, good characters, and healing in THE
HORSE WHISPERER to make this an enjoyable movie. 

Title
Review for You've Got Mail (1998)
Synopsis:
Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) email each other under
assumed names despite each being attached to a different, significant
other. Online Kathleen and Joe get along fabulously. Little do they know
that in real life they are hated rivals, since Kathleen owns a small
bookstore which is being run out of business by a large book chain owned
by Joe. When Joe finds out Kathleen's real life identity, he tries to
slowly woo her. Will they fall in love?
Opinion:
The film begins and ends with likable screen idols Meg Ryan and Tom
Hanks. In a good comedic touch, each deceives their lover in order to
sneak over to the computer and chat with each other. They are adorable
characters, and we immediately sympathize and want them to get together.
But something's not right; their partners seem cardboard and lacking in
human dimensions. After the movie progresses through countless facial
close-up shots and a false ending or two, we realize what is missing:
the joyous comedic element which YOU'VE GOT MAIL began with. In its
place is a plot similar to a 90s therapy session: Tom finds out Meg's
identity, and tries to slowly get her accustomed to the idea of him as a
romantic partner.
Bottom line? While friends might say, "been there, seen that," YOU'VE
GOT MAIL would still be a good selection for the "date" crowd or Tom
Hanks fans.

Title
Review for Mulan (1998)
Directed by: Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook
Written by: 
Eugenia Bostwick-Singer, Rita Hsiao, Christopher Sanders, Philip
LaZebnik, Raymond Singer, and Robert D. San Souci (story), based on the
classic Chinese folk tale.
Starring the voices of: 
Ming-Na Wen, Eddie Murphy, B.D. Wong, Soon-Tek Oh, and Pat Morita
Synopsis:
Rumored to be about a true person, the story of MULAN has circulated in
oral tradition for over a thousand years, and has inspired operas,
literature, and even coinage. (Since 1984, China has been issuing annual
gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures; the
1992 set includes Mulan.)
In THE BALLAD OF MULAN (written in the 5th or 6th Century), an imperial
edict by the Khan (Emperor) orders men from each family to be drafted
into the army to defend China. A girl's parents hear sighing, and think
that their daughter Mulan (the name means Magnolia) is dreaming of boys,
but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm
father if he were to be drafted off to battle. Mulan bravely runs away,
masquerading as a boy, to serve in the army instead of her father. Ten
thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later, the army finally
returns in triumph. The Emperor wants to reward Mulan's valor with a
prestigious position in government, but she declines, accepts a horse,
and returns home quietly to don her true clothes. Mulan's old army
buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that
Mulan is actually a woman.
The Disney animated feature MULAN is similar to the BALLAD story, only
it adds a modern character for comic relief: Mushu the dragon (Eddie
Murphy). 
In Disney's MULAN, when a fierce army of invading Huns threatens to
overrun peaceful China the Emperor orders one man from each family to be
conscripted into the army. Old Mr. Fa (Soon-Tek Oh) is handicapped and
has no son; he has only his spirited young daughter Mulan (Ming-Na Wen).
Fearing for her father's life, the courageous Mulan secretly cuts her
hair, disguises herself as a man, and sneaks off to serve in the army in
her father's stead.
Meanwhile Mushu, the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the Fa
family, has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of
incense burner. (His only duty is to ring a gong.) Mushu hits upon a
plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the
disguised Mulan to become a macho male warrior hero. 
With the help of Mushu, a horse, and a lucky cricket, can army recruit
Mulan save China and bring honor to the Fa family?
Opinion: 
East meets West. I know a chef in Santa Fe that does this sort of magic;
he combines Asian culinary influences from the West Coast with Latin
American from down south and European from the Atlantic to concoct new
creations that hit just the right combination of flavors. From their
state of the art animation studio in Orlando, Disney is hoping to work
the same kind of East/West magic with MULAN. 
I mean, what would you say if I told you that a new movie featured Tang
Dynasty art, with Donny Osmond singing, Ming-Na Wen acting, and Eddie
Murphy playing a Chinese dragon that makes pop references to BATMAN and
the Reverend Jessie Jackson? Yet this is the case in the Disney's
re-interpretation of the familiar Chinese classic. The end result is
spectacular; MULAN is one of Disney's best movies ever. 
Personally, I'm also glad to see the detestable American stereotype of
the weak-willed subservient Asian woman take a beating: Mulan is
portrayed as a normal, if spirited, compassionate gal capable of taking
the initiative.  
MULAN is more than just Eastern graphics and faces combined with
Westernized pop and Disney. Kids of any age will like the family themes,
and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing. And adolescent
and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor, while the boys
admire the battles. And adults can admire those male/female nuances as
well as the interplay between traditional notions of family, honor, and
duty with industrial age notions of romantic love, gumption, and
questioning. But even the tiniest details reveal quality. The movie's
art supervisors spent three weeks in China researching the right look:
negative spaces, positive detail, period clothing, and graphic designs
typical of the time and place. Computers were used for crowd scenes of
up to 30,000 people, and a special program called 'Attila' was used for
a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking Huns on horseback. And
singers Osmond and Salonga are at the top of their game.
Balance is crucial. A movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by
Eddie Murphy might not be Disney's cup of tea, but if you use the
character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited
heroine, then, Pow! The Dream Team. By the same token, a tale about a
girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself,
but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism
for a light hearted Disney romp. It's rare that a movie can seamlessly
combine elements from both East and West, old and young, male and female
into a cohesive and entertaining whole, but MULAN hits the universal
bullseye. It's movie for any age, creed, gender, or color.

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
Written by: Scott B. Smith, from a novel by Smith
Ingredients: Rural town, folks who find 4.4 million dollars and hide it
Starring: Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Brent Briscoe, Bridget Fonda
Synopsis: 
Near a rural Minnesota town, a morally upstanding married man, his
brother, and a friend stumble upon a crashed airplane filled with 4.4
million dollars. Instead of reporting it to the authorities, the men
decide to keep the money and keep the discovery a secret. After the
first lie is told, the situation snowballs into a web of lies, deceit,
murder, and betrayal.
Opinion:
I love the screenplay to this film; it's the material that classic
Alfred Hitchcock films are made of. Imagine, for example, a
salt-of-the-earth Jimmy Stewart kind of protagonist, and some cheerful
opening husband/wife scenes similar to Frank Capra's IT'S A WONDERFUL
LIFE (1946). Now have the guy make a moral blunder and watch the bad
karma escalate into more lies, deceit, claustrophobia, and even a
murderous cover up until the situation finally unravels into a
tumultuous ending. This is the kind of classic A SIMPLE PLAN might have
been.
A SIMPLE PLAN however, doesn't take this approach. In director Sam
Raimi's interpretation, the movie becomes a slow paced, cautionary farm
tale that uses too many interspersed scenes of winter snow and rural
animals such as foxes and crows to supply suspense symbolically rather
than physically. And Instead of showing a lot of before/after contrast
as the protagonist's simple life becomes horribly derailed, A SIMPLE
PLAN slowly works its way into it - - for example, not showing idyllic
life with the wife until well after the 4.4 million is discovered. This
slows down the pace of the movie, and blurs the dramatic impact. 
A SIMPLE PLAN is interesting, intelligent, and scenic, and features
superlative dramatic performances by the entire cast, especially Billy
Bob Thornton. If only A SIMPLE PLAN were done in the Hitchcock style it
would be a real classic, instead of merely a great acting performance.

Title
Review for Sliding Doors (1998)
Starring: Gwyneth Paltrow, John Hannah, John Lynch, Jeanne Tripplehorn
Ingredients: London gal, fate, true love, running joke about Monty
Python's Spanish Inquisition
SLIDING DOORS is a love 'what if' story. The gimmick is that it's really
two stories: the film follows the life of Helen (Gwyneth Paltrow) down
two directions. In the beginning, likeable gal 'Helen' (Gwyneth Paltrow)
gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job. So she goes into the
subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and
her sleeping live-in lover Gerry (John Lynch). 
Helen doesn't know it, but she is at a fateful junction in life: 1) If
she enters through the sliding door of a London subway train her life
takes one path with one future 2) If she stays on the platform her life
takes another path with a different future. The film shows what happens
in both paths, switching back and forth between intertwined, parallel
stories.
In story one, Helen meets a charming and talkative Monty Python fan
named James (John Hannah) on the train. Arriving home early, she
discovers that her live-in, Gerry (John Lynch), is having sex with his
former lover Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn). This leads to a life where
Helen moves out. Helen's winsome new friend James helps her recover from
a broken heart, and encourages her to start her own business. 
In story two, Helen experiences a different fate. She misses the train,
never meets James, and doesn't get home early enough to discover Gerry's
infidelity. In this new life, Helen takes up odd menial jobs, and faces
the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her
relationship with Gerry. 
Will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of
problems and setbacks in BOTH scenarios?
Opinion:
Rejoice all ye Monty Python fans, Gwyneth Paltrow fans, and watchers of
quirky romance flicks. At last here's proof that there's still
creativity in 1990s filmmaking.
SLIDING DOORS is refreshingly different from anything this year. Not
only is it a well-acted, heartwarming film, but it's also easily Gwyneth
Paltrow's best recent performance. When Helen (Paltrow) screams that her
unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker,' (a British phrase better
left untranslated) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about!
Nor does SLIDING DOORS go overboard with formulaic true love or other
stereotypes. Nobody scrambles around in danger, screaming, "I will find
you no matter what, my darling!" When Helen finds herself on a boat in
the starlight with James, she doesn't take the easy way out and leap
into his arms, since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache. And
handsome live-in boyfriend Gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk
(either a stud or a snob). Instead he's a nervous and indecisive, almost
helpless hunk. Another example: when one of the protagonists lies
wounded in a hospital, SLIDING DOORS gives us neither the 'hospital
miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation.
In other words, all of the characters seem non-stereotyped, human, and
local. 
There are minor inconveniences. Since SLIDING DOORS switches back and
forth between two possible fates, it's occasionally difficult to
distinguish between the two. Distinguishing between the two stories
isn't a problem in the scenes containing Paltrow, who sports two
different hairstyles. But in scenes containing only Lydia and Gerry, who
look the same in both stories, it's slightly confusing. Also, quite a
few snappy comebacks referring to American pop culture (Seinfeld, Woody
Allen, etc.) are spoken by the British characters. But these seem
slightly forced, given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly
British slang. Possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the
British so that American audiences can feel more comfortable?
SLIDING DOORS is a charming, quirky, original, happy romance with a
little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in.  MONTY PYTHON AND THE MEANING OF
FATE, anybody?

Title
Review for Seven Years in Tibet (1997)
Starring: 
Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, Jamyan Jamtsho Wangchuk, Sonam Wangchuck,
Tenzin Wangchuk, and Jetsun Pema
Ingredients: Austrian mountaineer, Dalai Lama, mountains
Synopsis: 
Rich Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer (Brad Pitt) gets sidetracked
when World War II interrupts his mission to climb Nanga Parbat, a
Himalayan peak that in 1939 has never been successfully scaled. Trying
to get back to Europe, Harrer and climbing teammate Peter Aufschnaiter
(David Thewlis) get stranded in Tibet, where they settle down, and
Harrer becomes the tutor of the bright-eyed young Dalai Lama. (The Dalai
Lama is the spiritual and political leader of Tibet). Harrer reluctantly
leaves Tibet when Chinese forces under Mao conquer the tiny mountain
country.
Trivia:
Jetsun Pema, the woman who plays the Dalai Lamas mother in the movie,
is actually the real life Dalai Lamas sister. In real life she takes
care of Tibetan refugee children living in India and her organization
has educated over 40,000 children. 
The movie is based on the true memoirs of Austrian mountaineer Heinrich
Harrer, who is still alive today at age 84. Harrer was a Nazi in the
1930s, and Germany's Stern magazine published a photo of Harrer
hobnobbing with Adolf Hitler.
Director Jean-Jacques Annaud is presently banned from entering China.
The movie was filmed mostly in the Andes mountains in South America.
Opinion:
Director Jean-Jacques Annaud directed two previous movies about a person
being modified by contact with another culture (Quest for Fire and
The Lover), so with Seven Years in Tibet, he was probably aiming for
a movie where a brash jerk runs away from his home country and comes
into contact with Tibet and slowly changes into a spiritual human being
until finally hes ready to return. Annaud wanted to show the mountain
climber learning to climb his own spiritual mountain, and symbolically
he tries to show this by having Heinrich Harrers clothes change from
riches to poor rags and slowly back to riches again. This doesnt quite
satisfy.  Usually in movies, when a character undergoes a change of
heart, they demonstrate their newfound character by doing an action or
making a difficult choice that they wouldnt have made under their old
personalities. In Annauds movie, the hero makes no such difficult
decision or actions. He wanders around Tibet, changes clothes a lot, and
then leaves when the Chinese take over and the Dalai Lama advises him to
leave. This lack of tough choices gives the movie only postcard depth,
like "I went to Tibet, I had a lot of bad luck, ran out of options, and
went back home to my responsibilities." Postcards arent bad though; the
scenery is breathtaking, even if it was shot in the Andes mountains
versus  the real Himalayas. Having the Harrer character make one or two
tough choices that demonstrate his spiritual redemption would have given
this movie more punch.
