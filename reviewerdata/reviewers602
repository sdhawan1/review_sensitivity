Title
Review for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)
     This has got to be the worst movie I've blown five bucks on in a very long
time.  Parts of it were, however, so bad that they were funny (Look, up in the
sky, it's a bird, it's a plane - it's a statue! ).
     By the way, after irrelevant scene 1, superman saving Soviet spacecraft,
when he hit the baseball in irrelevant scene 2, did anyone else think it was
going to hit the spacecraft (Look out Ivan - here we go again!).
     All in all, S-man had a lousy week (used up his dad's green thing,
violated the prime directive--non-interference--and had nothing to show for it).
But seriously, why was the subplot about the Daily Planet takeover in the movie
(to make it 2 hours long?)?  Why was Mariel Hemingway in the movie (to be a
damsel in distress for 18 seconds?)?  Chris Reeve did a really lousy job
writing this.  Why don't they get comic-book writers to write comic book
movies?
