Review for Dolores Claiborne (1995)
Starring: Jennifer Jason Leigh (Selena), Kathy Bates (Dolores Claiborne),
          David Strathairn
Directed by Taylor Hackford
Screenplay by Tony Gilroy, based on the novel by Stephen King
Rated R (language, sexual situations, violence)
Released: Friday March 24, 1995
Reviewed at Landmark's Shattuck Cinemas, Berkeley
     Castle Rock has a knack for turning out well
made--excellent--adaptations of Stephen King novels (STAND BY ME,
MISERY).  Last year brought us the sadly little seen, but terrific
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.
     So it's sad to say that DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a bit of a letdown.
The plot seems to be the problem--as it's quite thin and at 131 minutes
a lack of a strong plot becomes a bit tedious.
     Saving the film is an excellent performance by Kathy Bates, a
fitting score by Danny Elfman and some cinematography that's excellent
in parts.
     Kathy Bates as the title character perfects on her performance as
a loony fan in MISERY.  Yes, she even runs around with an ax, but we
never loose sympathy for her since she truthfully portrays an
"ordinary" woman who is sometimes pushed too far.  Jennifer Jason Leigh
is a bit hard to take at times, at times she seems to be too distant;
and redoing her accent from THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and MRS. PARKER AND THE
VICIOUS CIRCLE only distracts more.
     Since the movie is released by Sony's Columbia Pictures, the movie
is also available in SDDS.  Save your bucks and don't travel too far to
see a movie that rarely uses the system.  In fact all instances of SDDS
seem to have added by the foleys long after the movie wrapped up its
shooting.  The best use of the system is hearing an upstairs doorknob
being turned!  Often I kept thinking, had the director filmed this
scene from a different angle, we would have a perfect SDDS moment....
     This is after all a Stephen King movie, so there are a few plot
twists here and there.  Perhaps one too many, the ending doesn't quite
feel right.  Sadly, it seems to have been heavily influenced by the
"convenience city syndrome" found in OUTBREAK.

Review for Pulp Fiction (1994)
Running time:  144 minutes
MPAA rating: R (This being a Tarantino film, no extra explanation is
             necessary)
With: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel,
      Bruce Willis
Written & Directed by:  Quentin Tarantino (with Roger Avary on stories)
Produced by: Lawrence Bender
Released by Miramax
Reviewed at: Landmark's California, Berkeley, CA, Oct. 14, 1994 (with a very
             enthusiastic audience)
     The film starts and ends at a coffee shop, where two petty crooks
decide to rob something no one would ever expect to be the target of a
robbery: the very coffee shop they're having breakfast in.  The movie
cuts from them just after they start their heist, and then tells three
more stories before returning to our coffee guests.  Quickly, the three
segments are about taking the boss's wife out on a date; a boxer is
forced to take a dive--and doesn't comply; and deposing of a body.
     Just because this is the order things happen in the movie, does
not mean that this is the order things are chronologically.  Tarantino
successfully juxtaposes time to pack that extra punch.
      It's like having a dinner with several different foods, some you
don't like, some you love.  Therefore you save the best for last, but
once in a while you can't restrain yourself, you need that good stuff.
But you overeat on what you don't like, so you're a bit disappointed
when you're not able to eat all that good stuff.  But when the dessert
arrives, it's like a whole new stomach opens, and you eat all the
treats that are being served.
     The movie opens wonderfully, but loses some steam after a
while.  Not to worry: Tarantino strikes back with an overwhelming
power.  Especially the last hour and a half or so, which is one long
joyride.  Just like a good book where you keep counting pages, hoping
that there's a lot left.  Alas when the end comes--after two and a half
hours--the movie is definitely over.  You just sit there begging for
more.
     Like Tarantino's debut--and one of my favorite movies--RESERVOIR
DOGS, this movie is full of references to movies and life of all kind.
     Butch the pugilist, played by Bruce Willis, plans to run off to
Knoxville, Tennessee--the same town Tarantino himself was born.
     In the Tarantino executive produced and Roger Avary directed film,
KILLING ZOE, Eric Stoltz had a major part.  Well, he's here too!
     From RESERVOIR DOGS we have Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel in major
roles, but not the same.  Keitel more or less reprises his role from
POINT OF NO RETURN.
     And from TRUE ROMANCE we have Christopher Walken, Patricia
Arquette's sister--Rosanna, and making personal decisions in a
bathroom.
     Blaxploitation, pulp, noir, Godard.  And the list goes on and
on.  Really, the movie just has to be experienced.
     Yes, the trademark Tarantino dialog and violence is also in this
movie.  While the violence is perhaps more subdued, it's more often
played for humor.  There's no resisting laughing when Travolta
accidentally (because of a bump in the road) kills a guy and his blood
and brain splatters all over the car he's in.  It might be sick, but
it's a whole lot of fun.  This might not seem restrained, but it could
be a lot more violent.
     And for those wanting S&M, don't waste your money on EXIT TO EDEN,
this movie contains a rather shocking sadomasochistic scene with Bruce
Willis and Ving Rhames (who plays the man who makes Butch take the
fall).  The build up to this scene contains a scene where the one
person you wouldn't expect to die does.  (Tip: Don't go to the bathroom
without your weapon.)
     Christopher Walken has just one scene in the movie, in which he
explains how came the family gold watch which has gotten into his
possession--and more important how it was hidden during seven years of
P.O.W. captivity.  Things like this explain why the movie is more that
just "pulp."  In a lesser movie we would have the violence, but not the
humor.  The stars would just be there for sake of a simple cameo, and
nothing more.  The plot itself might not be considered as that
original.  But that's not what makes this film interesting.  It's what
happens to the characters that make the film so great.
     I could go on about more technical matters, but I wouldn't want
you to miss the next screening of PULP FICTION.

Title
Review for Everyone Says I Love You (1996)
I have seen several (but not that many) Woody Allen movies. I didn't
particulary like Radio Days, The Purple Rose of Cairo, Play it Again,
Sam.
I quite enjoyed Manhatten Murder Mystery and Everything ... Sex, and I
loved Might Aphrodite. However I found Bullets Over Broadway to be a
snoozing bore. And Bullets got some very raving reviews, but I didn't
think I'd like. But I finally saw it (double feature with Ready to
Wear I think) and hated it. Since ... I Love You also seems to be
getting raving reviews I wasn't sure if I'd want to see...
People burst into singing and dancing, something I hardly ever
like. But this movie is so infectious. And funny! And entertaining!
(And unlike Evita, they only sing when they need to.) Sure some of the
actors may not be great singers, but they seems to be having a great
time, and so does the audience.
That's all I have to say. Really, if you think that is going to be a
dull movie, you're probably dead. And dead people should not be forced
into movie theatres. Is Mark Leeper dead? He said that "This is an
almost ghastly misfire". 
The movie is rated R, for *one* use of the word motherf*****.
Rating: *** 1/2 out of ****

Title
Review for Simple Plan, A (1998)
(Re-)view January 10, 1999 at Cinemateket, Oslo, Norway
http://www.nfi.no/nfi/cinematek/
Directed by Sam Raimi (The Quick and the Dead, Darkman, The Evil Dead
series)
Written by Scott Smith, based on his novel
Cinematography by Alar Kivilo
MPAA rating: R for violence and language. (The book however is, as I
remember, more explicit)
Expectation rating: A bit worse than expected (mainly because I found
the middle part to be a bit dull). Roger Ebert gave it a four star
review, and while he is a critic that uses the full scale, and I often
agree -- such as Dark City being the best film of 1998, he must have
seen a better film. I read the book about five years ago and hugely
enjoyed it.
The opening of A Simple Plan reminded me a bit of The Sweet
Hereafter. The landscape is snowy and cold, and is filmed what I feel
is in a rather crisp manner (which also reminds me of Fargo (which I
loathed)). One can almost sense the cold. But the movie far from the
eye popping delights of The Quick and the Dead, instead Raimi has made
a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better. This is
probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd
shots.
The movie also reminded me of Affliction, as the lead characters all
seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life
than their father, and they see a chance for such a dream to come
true. This chance is uncovered in a snow covered field, where an
airplane has crash landed. In the plane three men find ŤThe American
dream ... in a gym bag.ť Affliction too was set in a snowy landscape.
It really seems very simple. Just hold on to the money until spring,
and if no one claims it, they'll be safe to spend it and their hope
of experiencing the American dream can come true.
But the snow melts, and so might several of the character's hopes.  As
in ŤReturn to Paradiseť, some of the characters are presented with a
chance to do the right thing. But doing the right thing might not
result in a better result than something more selfish.
The movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense. I have seen
many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from
the book visualized, eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent
story -- for example Clear and Present Danger. The biggest problem
seems to over-familiarization with the story. The writer perhaps feels
that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him, but the
lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book.
This is definitely not the problem with A Simple Plan, even though the
screenplay is by the book's author. The movie is always clear on where
it's going, and always makes sense. I'm sue a lot was cut, but really
I can't remember what. Even a minor scene involving a man complaining
that he has paid for too much grains is included. The man only comes in
on Mondays, but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase
too many. Turns out ... well, see the movie.
One should be warned against seeing the trailer. It reveals several
scenes from the ending moments (which yes, like in the book, it is a
downer), several plot developments, and much of the beginning. But
much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer, so if
you're lucky, you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the
movie.

Title
Review for Alien: Resurrection (1997)
Directed by: Jean-Pierre Jeunet
Starring: Sigourney Weaver, Winona Ryder, Dominique Peron, Dan Hedaya
Written by: Joss Whedon
(Re)viewed at Soria Moria 1, as part of Oslo internasjonale
filmfestival (http://wit.no/filmfestival) Friday, November 21 1997.
This is the fourth entry in the Alien saga. I've never really liked
Alien, but got a gigantic kick out of Aliens. Alienł is perhaps
underrated but I did not like all the tunnell running. And I didn't
particularly like the cop out at the beginning.
The premise for Alien Resurrection (not the lack of colon (:)-, there
is none on screen) is intriguing. Some blood from Ripley has been
recovered and is used to breed a new mother alien. This I think is
fascinating, but handled rather shortly in the film, though there is a
rather explicit Ťhintť at previous problems. I'd like tosee more of
this. But the purpose of the cloning is just brushed over and I get a
feeling that this isn't really interesting for the movie. The cloning
only seems to threre to serve as a setup for a remake of the earlier
films.  I.e. there is a lot of attacks and fights and people being
killed. There is a scene that is reminiscent of the death scene in
Alienł, and perhaps a character is a homage to both Alien and another
Ridley Scott film (director of Alien) - Blade Runner (which I also
dislike).
Of course the alien breaks loose, and get this - she is not
alone. People have been brought on board to act as incubators for more
aliens. All the aliens on the loose of course leads to a lot of people
trying to escape. Things go awry and the spaceship the movie is set on
reverts to emergency mode and is headed for a place we don't want the
ship to go. This is perhaps meant to be a tense situation, but I never
felt any kind of grip. We all know how things will end, don't we?
There are however several good action scenes, including one under
water. The movie is directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet who did the
visually wonderful Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children. I
suppose some of his inventivness can be seen on screen, such as (bad)
breath used to identify people. But really - the film doesn't go any
further compared to those two movies. It is just technically very well
done. The cinematography is by Darius Khondji, best known for Se7en
(he also did Delicatessen and City). And just like in Se7en there is
some gruesome violence, but most of it is just hinted at and if you
blink you might miss it.
The movie about 1 hour 50 minutes. This surprisingly short. I felt
that when the movie ended things were getting really interesting. But
perhaps Alien 5 will pick up here... (And there are no crazy credits
from what I could see.)

Title
Review for Smilla's Sense of Snow (1997)
Directed by Bille August
Written by Ann Biderman, based on the novel by Peter Hoeg
Contains sexual dialogue, sexual situations, violence
Smilla Jasperson lives alone in a Copenhagen apartment. Her closest
friend seems to a little boy called Isiah. Sadly he dies after falling
to death from the top of the apartment building roof. Why? Well that's
what Smilla wants to find out. She starts investigating, and finds a
conspiracy involving prehistoric worms (!).
The movie starts out quite good, with a scene that is not the book. A
meteorite (or something) crash lands not far away from where a man is
seal hunting, this starts an avalanche (or whatever) and he (his dogs
actually) has to run for his life. Quite well made, and the scenery
that preceded it is quite stunning.
I have not read the book (OK, I've read the first fifty pages), I do
however own the paperback. On the back it states something like blah
blah political blah blah (LA Times). That must have the book, because
a "critique of society" is nowhere to be found in this book. Unless
the movie's moral (?) - bad guys are bad (!) - counts.
Bille August has made directed several movies based on books. The ones
I have seen (Zappa, Pelle the Conqueror, The House of Spirits) all
have in comon that they in fact make sense. Even without having read
the books one could understand what was going on - but maybe not
why. Or as Variety puts it: Smilla Jasperson's motivations
may not always be clear to the uninitiated. 
That is also true of this movie. Without having read much of the book,
the first hour still seems to capture the spirit of the book (or I'd
guess it does). Just like The Firm. However after an hour or so it
turns into "Smilla Bond", which is quite unbelievable. It seems quite
unlikely that Smilla has learned to climd down ships, trek across
Greenland etc. I do not know if this was in the book, but I hope not.
I have seen several movies that were incomprehensible without having
read the book (and with, say, Clear and Present Danger, that didn't
help much either). I have often seen movies based on books that have
made not want to see the movie. After seeing the first hour I thought
that I might want to read the whole book. After seeing the second hour
I'm not so sure. It could be that Peter Hoeg is not much of a crime
writer and had no idea as how to wrap things up. Or it could be that
the book's (and the movie's) ending in fact is crap. The ending in
fact seems like a cross of something like a Michael Crichton book
(perhaps The Andromeda Strain) and Superman III. (I'll get back to the
ending.)
Julia Ormond is quite pretty to watch, but she certainly does not look
anything like a Greenlander (or Eskimo). She also seems to have some
sort of Danish accent - which no one else in the movie has. Although
the much of the movie is set in Copenhagen, Denmark, almost everyone
speaks perfect English. One guy acts more English than Danish, and
reminded me of a commercial for Fisherman's Friend.
Somewhat irritating is the score. Intense situations = very intense
music. The cinematography is at time quite stunning (is there any
other kind as Roger Ebert would have said). Buy why is stock ice
footage used? Note to filmmakers: it's distracting.
The ending is probably the stupidest I have seen in quite some time,
and reminds me of Superman III. Though the movie is downhill only
during the second half, they could surely have thought of something
better? Towards the end of the movie we get to see *the* *most*
*unbelieable* version of "hope the baddie doen't turn his head another
inch or he'll see me".
The explanation as to why the boy plunged to his death? Stupid! Turns
out that Smilla knew all along what happened. Why on earth couldn't
she have revealed this during the first hour?
Hm... This review turned out more negative than I planned. Oh well.
Rating: total: ** 1/2 out of **** (first hour only: add a star)

Title
Review for Meet Joe Black (1998)
(Re-)view January 16, 1999 at Filmteatret, Oslo, Norway
http://www.filmweb.no/oslokino/
Directed by Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman, Midnight Run, Beverly
Hills Cop)
Written by Ron Osborn & Jeff Reno and Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman
Music by Thomas Newman (nominated for an Oscar for Little Women, The
Shawshank Redemption)
Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (nominated for an Oscar for A
Little Oscar)
Production designer: Dante Ferretti (nominated for an Oscar for
Kundun, Interview with the Vampire, Age of Innocence, Hamlet, The
Adventures of Baron Munchausen -- and probably for this movie)
Expectation rating: About as expected. When I first heard of the film
I thought ŤThis sounds interesting!ť. But the reviews were lukewarm
and audience reception not that hot either (but much better than you'd
think after reading all these reports about a troubled Universal), but
when I got to a chance to see it for free I thought I'd give it a
chance.
MPAA rating: PG-13 for an accident scene (Brad Pitt used in a game of
car ping-pong), some sexuality (Claire Forlani and Death bonking,
about as sexual as Ally McBeal gets) and brief strong language
(several shits and hells, one f-word used in a non sexual context).
This Christmas I saw an episode of the Twilight Zone on the Sci-Fi
channel. It was called ŤOne for the Angelsť. In this episode a man i
visited by death, is told that his time has come, but is granted one
last wish, something the man for a very long time has wanted to do: he
wants to make a fabulous sales pitch, ŤOne for the Angelsť. As long as
the wish is unfulfilled he will live; of course this means that the
poor man will make another sales pitch again in his life. But Death is
cunning, and the man has to out-cun Death.
The Twilight Zone episode makes a point out of that Death is a
character, not just a fancy name. In Meet Joe Black Death is just a
character, like any other character. Death/Joe Black could just as well
have been an imposter blackmailing Bill Parrish, or perhaps he could
have been a long lost son, now threatening to reveal a secret, like in
the Danish movie The Celebration. The movie never really makes much
use of the fact that Joe Black is Death.
One evening Joe Black calls on Bill's door while his whole family is
gathered for dinner, he'll be 65 in a few days. In a matter of a few
minutes Bill accepts the fact that Death has arrived, but that Death
wants Bill to show him some earthly delights for a while. Bill accepts
this, just like that, almost no questions asked. Will gets to live as
long as Death is interested and intrigued by what he sees. When he has
seen enough, he will take Bill away from this world.
This doesn't take long. And no wonder, besides the fact that he has a
beautiful daughter to interest Death, Bill does nothing interesting. The
movie seems stuck in all the dull moments of Will's life. Board
meeting. Board meeting. Yet another dull board meeting. There's no
sense of exploration. Did Death know this and still choose to see what
humans are like? Why not choose someone else, someone who leads a more
adventurous life?
After meeting Death, Bill presents Joe to his family. Joe does not
recognize Susan, Bill's daughter, although "they" -- the person Death
has inhabited did -- flirted earlier that day in a restaurant.
Odd. So he doesn't know anything about the people he picks up and
their surroundings? What is his purpose? Does he work for God?
Doesn't God tell him anything? Or is a free-lancer, a bit of God work
here, a bit of Satan work there? He's an angel, isn't he? In ŤDer
Himmel über Berlinť and ŤCity of Angelsť they could read people's
minds, Death doesn't seem to able to so in this movie, or only when it
suits the script. Such as when he invades Bill's mind with "the
voice".
Susan is in love with Drew, an associate of Bill, or so she says. Bill
doubts this, because of what she does not say. She does not seem
passionate about Drew. And this is perhaps the movie's greatest fault:
not what it says, but what it doesn't say. The movie presented here
has an intriguing premise, but not much is done with it. Too much time
is spent on family dinners and corporate board room meetings.
The biggest problem with the movie is its length. It goes on and on
and never seems to end, to quote Roger Ebert: ŤThere are farewells,
reflections, confessions, reassurances, reconciliations, partings and
surprisesť. (And it takes about 1 hour 50 minutes before Claire
Forlani and Death do you-know-what.) The Twilight Zone episode was
under 30 minutes long, and was never dull. Meet Joe Black is a three
hour movie, but can only sustain two hours. Maybe be a cut TV or
airline version would be to prefer. But the movie is at times oddly
fun, such as when Death proclaims ŤDeath and taxes? What an odd
pairingť.
Bill never inquires into why and how he works; is there life after
death? In one scene involving a Jamaican woman (Pitt talks to her in
her own dialect, there's even a dialect coach listed in the credits --
there are also two editors listed, and they didn't seem capable of
editing much...) where Pitt tells her to close her eyes, and she
seems content(?) with what she sees. But that is all. The tag-line for
the movie is supposedly ŤNo one can die - while he loves!ť. So how
about showing that? Some comic interludes where the local newscast
reports about people jumping from the Brooklyn Bridge or something,
but not being able to die? (I believe that the inspiring movie, Death
Takes a Holiday, which I have not seen, tackles this subject.)
Later he tells a character that he cheated on an exam. How does he
know that? Was he only kidding? So he must be able to find out things
about the people with whom he interacts, otherwise he wouldn't have
picked up on the conversations between dad and daughter. Yet, he seems
very unenlightened on the subject of sex, but when he gets a taste of
it, he proclaims that it's better than peanut butter. 
What I liked most about the movie was the more technical aspects. I
liked looking at, especially the party at the end with all the lights
and all the people. (And in particular a scene with Forlani and Pitt
where they are surrounded by a whole bunch of guests, but ultimately
surrounded by each other -- which is all we see). The score is by
Thomas Newman, which I felt was fitting, but is the kind of music I
would go out and buy, and listen to it unaccompanied by a movie.  Also
fascinating is the fact that Bill's New York penthouse apartment, with
pool and all, was filmed on a New York sound-stage. That had to cost
money! (The absolute highlight, however, is Claire Forlani, and all
the wonderful dresses she wears.)
The trailers are not quite the spoiler fests they could have been,
perhaps because there's not much to spoil. However, they do contain
scenes from the very end of the movie.
ŤA Matter of Life and Deathť aka ŤStairway to Heavenť (1946) by
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.
Defending Your Lifeť (1991) By Albert Brooks.
Both are movies where a man must plead before a heavenly court, for
his life and the person he loves.
