Review for Rambo: First Blood Part II (1985)
All of them star Sylvester Stallone  as 'John J. Rambo' and Richard Crenna as 
his Green Beret Commanding Officer from Vietnam.
All of these movies are entertaining in their own little way.  None of them 
are realistic in any sense, unless you believe that one man can jump down 
hundreds of feet into a waterfall, get shot in the face, trip, get extensive 
shock treatment, and still be alive.  These movies don't feature Stallone's 
finest acting (for that I would advise you to see the first few ROCKY movies 
or OSCAR).  The plots are laughable.  Let's get on with it...
FIRST BLOOD begins with John J. Rambo trying to contact his war buddies from 
his platoon in Vietnam.  All of them are dead; one even died from cancer after 
the war.  Rambo, feeling depressed, takes a walk through a place which is 
either called Hope or Holiday Land (the sign he sees when he walks in says 
Holiday Land, but the town has signs like 'The Hope Inn').  A local police 
officer gives Rambo a ride to get out of town because he "doesn't want 
drifters in his town".  Rambo gets pissed and begins walking towards a bridge 
and is arrested for vagrancy.  He gets badly beaten in jail.
But, as one of the police officers puts it, Rambo is a "bad ass".  He fights 
his way out of the guarded prison cell and boogies down to the nearest 
forested area to hide out from his pursuers.  A former leading Officer in 
Vietnam who Rambo was familiar with tries to convince Rambo to come out 
peacefully.  Rambo refuses and as a result lots of people die and buildings 
blow up for no real reason.  The movie's scenes with Sylvester Stallone have a 
good combination of suspense and action.  There is humor as well.  For 
instance in one scene Rambo commandeers an army truck and tells the driver to 
keep on driving.  The driver is looking crazy at Rambo.  Rambo snaps back with 
"Don't look at me; look at the road.  That's how accidents happen!!"  The 
scenes without Rambo are slow and full of dialogue, which make up a third of 
the movie.  The dialogue isn't really even very interesting, dragging down 
what should be an exciting film.  FIRST BLOOD is entertaining enough to watch 
for the action bits...  I give FIRST BLOOD ** 1/2 out of ****.
RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II has a pathetic excuse for a title.  The plot 
involves Rambo being let go from jail to go to Cambodia to pick up POW's from 
Vietnam.  They pick Rambo because he is expendable; Rambo defines the term as 
"It's like when you are being invited to a party but nobody really cares if 
you don't show up.".  Along the way, Rambo links up with a Vietnamese chick 
who helps his cause.  There is more violence and more explosions than in the 
first one.
The beginning of this movie is awful.  It has nothing but Rambo being briefed 
about his mission for around 30 minutes.  Full of pointless dialogue that 
makes you want to turn off the movie and return it for a refund at your local 
video rental store.  But then when he begins to attack the Vietnamese, it gets 
rather entertaining.  Rambo fights them with a gun, a bow and arrow, a bow and 
flaming arrow, and many other things.  The funniest part in the movie is a 
totally over-the-top blastfest that has Rambo in a helicopter for 10 minutes 
blowing up everything to tiny bits.  It is a scene that makes the whole movie 
worthwhile and reccomendable for that one scene alone.  Amazing!!  It also 
ends with a cheesy 'Let's Save Our Brothers' love theme that has nothing to do 
with the movie whatsoever during the closing credits.  I give RAMBO: FIRST 
BLOOD PART II *** out of **** for the incredible helicopter sequence and 
over-the-top violence.  Just skip the first thirty minutes, if you can...  :)
RAMBO III is when the series has gone to the ground.  Our friend Rambo is now 
a monk beating the hell out of people to get money to support the monastery he 
builds in his free time.  When asked to be sent to quell a Russian attack in a 
Middle Eastern country, Rambo refuses.  When his Vietnam Officer from the 
previous two films gets captures, Rambo comes along for a major killing/blast 
fest spree.
The amount of killing and explosions are quite entertaining.  Just the first 
HALF of the movie is boring dialogue again with little importance to the plot. 
Nobody watches a RAMBO movie expecting a story; give us violence damn it!!
We want to watch people getting blown up as well as buildings being zapped.  
No more stupid talking sequences!  I give RAMBO III ** out of **** only for 
its good action parts.

Review for Rocky III (1982)
ROCKY III
Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Mr. T, Hulk Hogan, Burgess Meredith.
Most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy.  
ROCKY III seems to kind of fit in that category, but manages to be slightly 
unique.  The ROCKY formula of "Rocky loses fight/Rocky trains/Rocky wins 
fight" is carried out to the letter.  Also the 'tradition' of showing the last 
five minutes or so from the past ROCKY film is used as well.  This movie 
begins with a series of clips showing how famous Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) 
has become...  Even showing a brief appearance on Sesame Street!!
Then it moves on with Rocky being in a fixed fight with Thunderlips (Hulk 
Hogan).  A mysterious bad-ass known as Clubber Lang (Mr. T) trash-talks to 
Rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he "pities the 
fool" for not coming out and fighting him outright.  Rocky's trainer (Burgess 
Meredith) tells Rocky not to fight, but the Italian Stallion doesn't listen.  
Naturally, he gets his ass kicked.  
Somewhere along the line after this several things happen.  Rocky's longtime 
trainer dies, causing Rocky to train with his former opponent Apollo Creed.  
Rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight.  The final fight 
ensues between Clubber and Rocky.  Guess who wins?  The winner's name rhymes 
with 'Smocky'.
The movie is entertaning mainly because of Clubber Lang's over the top 
performance.  The dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since ROCKY 
II and now action seems to be the strong point of the film.  Which is good if 
you like fighting scenes.  The last match is quite decent actually.
If you liked the previous films, rent this one.  It's well worth seeing if you 
are a fan of the series.  But if you can't stand Rocky shouting "Adrianne!!!" 
one more time, see something else.

Review for Super Mario Bros. (1993)
Movies have been based on novels for a while.  Even old TV-shows and comic 
books.  But only recently have movies been based on video games.  The 
following are short reviews of some recent movies based on video games.
Enjoy.  Send any comments/critiques/flames to magus@mindspring.com (me).
Enjoy!!
SUPER MARIO BROS.: THE MOVIE (1994)
Starring: Dennis Hopper and John Leguizamo
This movie is based off the wildly popular video-game series of the same name. 
 Before this film, the game had a few spin-off cartoons- which were OK.  But 
the idea of doing a movie is insane.  It should have been animated, if it 
should have been done at all.  Instead the people do the best they can with a 
talented cast.  Yet it still fails.
The plot is completely different from the game's plot- I'm not complaining 
about that.  The story involves the Mario Bros. having a plumbing business in 
Brooklyn and having to compete with a rival company.  Eventually they find a 
construction site by their nemesis, which happens to be enviromentally 
un-safe.  So, due to Luigi's (John Leguizamo) girlfriend - Princess Daisy - 
they go and investigate.  They get transported to a Blade Runner-esque world 
lead by King Koopa (Dennis Hopper).  Somehow a plot dealing with all the 
dinosaurs being mutated and transported to an alternate futuristic mega-city 
jumbles in.  The plot is fine- better than the movie deserves.
The acting is OK.  This seems to be more of a visual film.  The special 
effects are good, especially on the robotic Yoshi.  However the film drags and 
is no fun.  And it leaves itself open to a sequel, which probably won't ever 
be made.  This movie begins sort of promising, but ends up leaving a weird 
taste in your mouth.  So if you want to watch a sort of odd movie starring the 
excellent Dennis Hopper, then watch SUPER MARIO BROS.: THE MOVIE.  You could 
do worse.  But you could definitely do better...
*1/2 out of ****.
STREET FIGHTER: THE MOVIE (1995)
Starring: Raul Julia and Jean Claude Van-Damme
This movie was based off of a series of never ending sequels to a game called 
Street Fighter 2.  It has all the characters from the game in a reasonable 
plot.  It is more like a "movie" than it should be.  Yes, it's watchable.  
Raul Julia does a good job, considering this was his final film.  While the 
game had non-stop fighting sequences, this movie is a hodge-podge of action 
scenes and flashy sets and costumes while trying to show off a plot at the 
same time.  Does it work?  Sort of...
The plot involves the evil Shadowloo Organization run by M. Bison (Raul 
Julia).  Guile (Jean Claude Van-Damme) takes his troops to attack Bison's main 
base in an attempt to liberate the innocent villages he has taken over.  In a 
short amount of time, the movie introduces several characters well.  It 
catches your attention.  But it ultimately seems like a showcase for fans of 
the game so you can point out things like "There's Chun Li!!" or "Look at that 
Fire-Ball Ryu did at Vega".  It hits the bases by presenting the characters in 
a plot with good sets, but goes no further.
This movie needed more action in the first place.  The action scenes that are 
here are short and not very exciting.  If you like light-hearted action 
flicks, or if you liked the game, watch this one.  It is even worth watching 
if you want to see Raul Julia's last performance, or if you can't get enough 
of Van Damme.  Other than that, you could find better action flicks.
** out of ****.

Review for First Knight (1995)
This movie does not follow the original King Arthur legends at all.  Yet a 
movie that did would probably not be as appealing to audiences- for instance 
Lancelot is supposed to be rather ugly.  So this change in plot could be 
over-seen if the movie was fantastic.  FIRST KNIGHT is not.  It has its 
moments, but fails to reach the epic proportions it needs to reach to succeed. 
Still, if a combination of sword-fights, Sean Connery, and love scenes sounds 
appealing- watch it.
The plot involves Malagant (similar to the character Mordred from the 
legends) causing havoc all over Camelot's neighboring cities.  Meanwhile a 
promising adventurer named Lancelot manages to save Princess Guinevere's life. 
 In exchange for this, Lancelot becomes a famed knight of the Round Table.  
Yet Guinevere and Lancelot fall in love, causing complications...
Sean Connery does a fine job as an older King Arthur.  Richard Gere as 
Lancelot is passable- but not great.  There is a neat scene where Lancelot 
weaves his way in and out of a gauntlet during a festival.  The music works, 
but the fact the Merlin is not in here at all is disturbing...

Title
Review for Fifth Element, The (1997)
The start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie STARGATE.  People 
are looking around in an Egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing 
that is going to destroy Earth in the future.  After a sort of confusing bit 
involving fake-looking cyborg things, the movie jumps into the future and the 
movie improves by leaps and bounds.
The basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while (make that every 
1000 years or so) an evil force comes to destroy Earth.  The things needed to 
defend against this menace are the four Elements of Nature plus the Fifth 
Element.  The plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing 
though.
This movie has very good special effects, for the most part.  The techno-ish 
music in the background fits the mood very well.  Bruce Willis is an illegal 
taxi-cab driver in a futuristic New York City.  One day a lady draped with a 
few bandages drops down into his trunk.  This movie is about what happens.
The plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the 
viewer with a variety of different locations.  Also there is a fair bit of 
action in the film, particularly towards the end.  Some characters are just 
plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag.  Bruce Willis does 
his normal job of blowing things away like he always does.
The movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down.  It is one of those 
sci-fi films where you'll be saying "cool" followed by a "what the hell?!?!".  
I give The Fifth Element *** out of ****.

Review for Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas (1997) (V)
BEAUTY AND THE BEAST- ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS
Featuring the voices of Angela Lansbury and Tim Curry
I was rather surprised when Disney decided to recently release a 
direct-to-video sequel to the animated feature they made in the early 1990's 
called BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The Disney animated features have gone down-hill 
since THE LION KING (1994).  However this direct-to-video release surprised 
me- it is quite good.
The thing that surprised me the most at first was how they kept the animation 
quality to a high standard.  Computer graphics are used in spots, but look 
best when they animate the evil church organ Forte (voiced by Tim Curry, who 
was Dr. Frank N Furter in ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and was the Butler in the 
movie CLUE).  The animation isn't cheap looking, as it was in RETURN TO JAFAR 
for example...  I haven't seen the third ALADDIN sequel yet, so I can't 
comment on its animation.  Anyhow, this movie has great animation quality and 
uses a wide variety of camera shots.
Also the plot is not a  re-hash of the original film.  The plot involves Belle 
wanting to celebrate Christmas, even though she knows from her silverware and 
furniture friends (among which are Mrs. Potts, voiced by Angela Lansbury 
(star in MURDER SHE WROTE tv series, among many other things) that the Beast 
despises the holiday.  Meanwhile the evil organ Forte "helps" the Beast by 
releasing his dark side, sort of like what the Emperor attempts to do to Luke 
Skywalker in RETURN OF THE JEDI (1984).  Tim Curry does a marvelous job as the 
villain.  The script is rather good, with some cheesy lines you would expect 
from a movie like AIRPLANE! (such as the line 'Don't whine glasses...'.  get 
the pun? :) ).
The songs are very good, unlike songs from HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and 
HERCULES.  While the animated features I just mentioned contain maybe one song 
I like from each of them, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST- ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS contains 
songs that are at least hummable and enjoyable all throughout.  I noticed the 
person who composed the music and wrote the lyrics was the same person, but 
not the standard Disney Menken/Rice team.  She should move up to doing songs 
for feature films!!  The plot is darker, which I liked.  Watch this film.  It 
has a high production quality while using the same voices from the original 
movie, as well as new ones.  It is a little bit over an hour long, a bit 
short, but still is quite good.  I give BEAUTY AND THE BEAST- ENCHANTED 
CHRISTMAS ***1/2 out of ****.  Little kids might not like the dark aspects to 
it.

Review for Planet of the Apes (1968)
STARRING: CHARLTON HESTON AND RODDY MCDOWALL
There are mainly two groups of science fiction.  One group is primarily action 
based using scientific impossibilities as objects in the story, such as 
INDEPENDENCE DAY, STAR WARS, and EVENT HORIZON.  The other group creates a 
scientifically impossible situation that is resolved by using brains and logic 
rather than brawn and weapons like many of the STAR TREK films, DARK CITY, and 
DR. STRANGELOVE.  PLANET OF THE APES falls in the "brains" category.
It starts with a ship crashing on another planet.  The crew members, which 
include Taylor (CHARLTON HESTON), decide to explore.  This planet seems barren 
until the trio of astronauts discover a race of stupid humans.  Taylor 
comments, "If this is the best they have, we'll have this planet conquered in 
about 6 months."  Soon chaos erupts as a group of gorillas charge forward and 
begin to brutally attack any human they see.  Taylor is trapped on the PLANET 
OF THE APES.  He finds some friends in the form of Cornelius (RODDY MCDOWALL) 
and Zira (Kim Hunter), a pair of chimpanzees devoted to domesticating humans.  
The Head of Science and Religion, Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), doesn't wish 
humans and apes to get along however...
This movie won an Honorary Oscar for its detailed make-up effects used on the 
many varieties of apes in the film.  The acting is pretty decent throughout, 
with some exceptions.  Several of the lines are variations on classic humans 
phrases: "Monkey see, monkey do" becoming "Human see, human do" is a decent 
example.  The special effects of the opening sequence leave a lot to be 
desired.  The first 30 minutes of the film are pretty slow, but the film picks 
up as soon as the apes come in and doesn't stop until the surprise ending.
Those who are used to more action-oriented films will probably be bored by 
this movie.  It has a little bit of action here and there, but not enough to 
say that it dominates the whole film.  PLANET OF THE APES is an interesting 
science fiction film that will leave you thinking at the end with its subtle 
commentary on humans as a race.  I give it *** out of ****.

Review for "Robocop" (1994)
The following reviews are Copyright 1998 by Mathew Tschirgi and may not be 
reproduced in any form, written or electronically, without his direct 
permission- gained by e-mailing him at magus@mindspring.com.  Any comments on 
these reviews may be sent to magus@mindspring.com.  Thank you- now enjoy the 
reviews.
This movie was one of the first American films done by director Paul 
Verhoeven.  He has done films since then such as BASIC INSTICT and STARSHIP 
TROOPERS.  All of his movies have one main thing in common- they don't skimp 
on the violence.  In a Verhoeven movie a guy doesn't get shot once in the 
chest- he gets shot many times all over the body.
ROBOCOP takes place in Detroit in the future.  Things are pretty bleak.  The 
company OCP rules the city with an iron fist and is moving in on running the 
police force.  Peter Weller plays a cop who goes on a mission with his 
partner, Nancy Allen.  Peter Weller goes in an empty room alone and gets 
killed.
Meanwhile OCP has a failed demonstration of a ED-209 model robot crime 
fighter.  Someone comes up with the idea of having a cyborg Robocop so they 
use any parts worth scalvaging from Peter Weller and make him into the Robocop 
the movie is titled after.
The plot of this movie generally runs at a decent pace.  It drags a bit 
towards the end with Robocop wanting to finish everybody off, but plot twists 
keep it exciting.  The acting is  bad from Weller when he is human, but very 
good when he is Robocop.  Nancy Allen does a decent job.  This movie doesn't 
leave itself open for a sequel exactly.  But they made one anyway.  Enter...
Detroit is in a more bleak state than it was in the first film.  OCP is trying 
to develop an improved 'Robocop 2' that will be more than a match for 
criminals.  Most of the police force is on strike due to OCP taking it over, 
leaving Robocop to be the police force in the city.
This film is pretty bizaare.  It has a 13 year-old drug-lord who curses as 
much as Eddie Murphy, even MORE violence than the original, and some more 
humor.  The plot of this movie is pretty large, almost too much so.  There are 
three or four plot lines weaving around that don't really match up.  The 
effects are still decent though.
This sequel isn't more of the same really, just a darker version ROBOCOP 
dealing more with drugs than with armed criminals.  If you liked the first 
one, watch this.  But be dissapointed.  So later comes...
OCP is now owned by a large Japanese company.  Robocop joins a band of rebels 
to counter-attack the evil Empire, I mean OCP.  The Japanese send a 
cyborg-ninja to deal with Robocop.  Among other things...
This movie is easier to follow than the last one.  Which means the plot isn't 
quite as crowded.  This movie isn't anything special though.  Just more of 
Robocop blasting things up in a more kid-friendly way.  Really not reccomended.

Title
Review for Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995)
Mel Brooks has done a lot of films- this one being the most recent.  Sometimes 
they are great and sometimes they flop big time.  The main problem with 
DRACULA: DEAD & LOVING IT is that it relies on the fact that the viwer has 
knowledge of DRACULA from the film with Bela Lugosi, the 1990 remake with Gary 
Oldman, the novel itself, as well as a decent vampire lore knowledge to get a 
majority of the jokes.  I fit into this category, but those who don't would 
think the film is lame.
The plot follows the Bela Lugosi version exactly which was actually based on a 
play and is not that similar to the original book by Bram Stoker.  It begins 
with Renfield going to Count Dracula's castle to have him sign a deal to get 
land in London.  Peter MacNicol (the mad painter in GHOSTBUSTERS 2 and the 
American guy in BEAN) does a great job as Renfield.  At the start he is 
mediocre, but when he becomes insane the best performance of the movie comes 
out.  Renfield is perfect while having the little quirks that make a memorable 
character.
As for the other characters...  Mel Brooks does a good job as Van Helsing.  
Leslie Neilsen was a little miscast for the title role of Dracula since 
everyone is used to seeing him in the NAKED GUN movies.  He does an OK job, 
but is he a convincing vampire?  No, but he isn't trying to be either.  Amy 
Yasbeck, last seen in Mel Brooks' film ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS as Maid 
Marion, is fine for the role of Mina.  So the cast works fine with eachother 
and the script has some good lines.
Some of the lines, like I said before, require knowledge of prior Dracula 
films.  This line for example:
(A bat flies down and poops on the stairs)
Dracula: Creatures of the night...  What a mess they make...
See what I mean? It doesn't really work as a visual gag, yet the line itself 
is a pun on the line "Creatures of the night...  What music they make" done by 
Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula film.  The humor hits and misses.  The 
best scene involves when Van Helsing and Harker (played by some guy on the 
show WINGS) go to execute Lucy in her Nosferatu form.  I saw this film first 
in a theatre and rather liked it, yet the audience laughs were far and few 
between.  Renfield is great, as is the decent instrumental music score, but 
the film doesn't work because of the way the humor is done...  Mel Brooks 
hasn't made a horrid film, he just has done much better.
Overall, I give Dracula: Dead and Loving it **1/2 out of ****.  If you are a 
fan of vampire films or a fan of Mel Brooks film, go and rent it.  Others 
should rent some of the funnier Brooks films like SPACEBALLS, BLAZING SADDLES, 
YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, THE PRODUCERS, and ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS.
This film IS better than MEL BROOKS' HISTORY OF THE WORLD: PART I.

Review for Rocky Horror Picture Show, The (1975)
This review is by Mathew Tschirgi and may not be reprinted in any form without 
his permission unless one e-mails him at magus@mindspring.com.  Thank you.
THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW 'SPECIAL EDITION' (1975)
Starring: Tim Curry and Susan Sarandon
Cult films are never mainstream.  The casual viewer of a cult film will look 
at it and be repulsed and confused, yelling out 'What the hell is that?'.  
Fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all 
the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie 
watchers will look at them like they're insane.  THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE 
SHOW, recently re-released in a 'SPECIAL EDITION' to video, is the mother of 
all cult films.  Period.
Like some other cult films, most notably LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, THE ROCKY 
HORROR PICTURE SHOW is a musical with a twisted edge to it.  This movie begins 
out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a 
flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining.  They go to a castle 
to try to use the phone.  Little do they know that the castle is owned by Dr. 
Frank N. Furter, a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently 
created a creature he will use for personal reasons.
The acting is pretty good overall.  Tim Curry (HOME ALONE 2, LEGEND) is 
over-the-top as Frank N. Furter.  It's interesting to see that this movie was 
one of future Oscar winner Susan Sarandon's (DEAD MAN WALKING) first film- she 
plays Janet, the girlfriend of Brad Majors.  Even the singer Meatloaf is in 
it!!
The songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way.  A sampling of 
titles range from DAMN IT, JANET to TOUCH-A TOUCH-A TOUCH-A TOUCH ME.
All the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a 
bad thing.  Barry Bostwick (Brad Majors) tries to sing as does Susan Sarandon, 
but Tim Curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage 
experience.  Meatloaf sings like Meatloaf.
The new SPECIAL EDITION contains two original movie trailers of the film as 
well as two songs deleted from the original version.  Sadly, the songs are 
tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose.  If you want to see a 
different film, watch this one!!
