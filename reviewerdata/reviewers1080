the book by James Lee Burke

(Robin Gaddis), Kelly Lynch (Annie Robicheaux), Teri Hatcher
(Claudette Rocque),  Eric Roberts (Bubba Rocque)

Rating: * out of *****
First and foremost I think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the
PG rating it's been given.  For those of us who haven't read the James
Lee Burke novel that HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is based on, do not rabidly
go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of Alec
Baldwin and Eric Roberts, feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps,
gangsters with Louisiana accents, plots, sub-plots, more plots, and well,
really just want to see Teri Hatcher naked, this is one movie you're
going to worry the price of admission over.  Hopeful still?  Well, let me
share my moment of sheer panic, and then the cold enervation of the big
let-down when a semi-robed Hatcher purrs to Alec Baldwin, "What do you
think of my butterfly?".  Butterfly?, I asked myself, What butterfly?!
And then it hit me... the scene had been SNIPPED!  DAMN YOU, GODLESS PG
RATING, SHOW US HER BUTTERFLY!!  WE WANT TO SEE THE
GODDAMN BUTTERFLY!!! So... no naked Teri Hatcher.  Forget about that.
Okay?  Now...
HEAVEN'S PRISONERS is about ex-alchoholic ex-cop Dave Robicheaux
(Alec Baldwin) who's trying to discover life anew running a bait shop and
boat hire business with his loving, down-to-earth wife Annie (Kelly 
Lynch).
Everything dull, but hunky dory until a plane carrying illegal immigrants
crashes almost ontop of the couple while they're on their boat.  The
plane nosedives into the water and sinks, but from its wreckage
Robicheaux rescues a little pixie-faced Salvadoran girl whom he and his
wife immediately decide to adopt.  What they don't realise is that the
plane's pilot was also a drug dealer, and that the plane had been
sabotaged by the latter's erstwhile colleagues.  When Robicheaux
discovers this, he predictably, against the advice of his wife, a
well-meaning DEA agent, and two gangsters who rough him up, begins
'poking his nose where it don't belong', we know that the man deserves
all the misery he's going to get.
The question now is whether or not you want to be dragged along for the
ride through a tedious, meandering yet utterly suspenseless plot with an
unlovable hero as your guide.  As Dave Robicheaux, Alec Baldwin is fat...
no seriously, this is not the svelte, thinking man's hero of THE HUNT FOR
RED OCTOBER, it is an out-of-shape guy who doesn't look too good in a
roof-top chasing scene.  He's also unconvincing in the movie's dramatic
moments, acting with what as far as I can tell is a Steven Segal-like
economy of expression.  Three-quarters of the way through the show, while
you're probably waiting for the next scene in a bar where Robicheaux
contemplates succumbing to the temptation of the whiskey bottle, getting
drunk and beating up someone or getting beaten up, you'll want to beat on
him a little yourself.
On the other hand, Mary Stuart Masterson (SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL,
FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, BENNY & JOON) cast as a down-and-out
stripper who has her fingers broken is quite a breath of fresh air, with 
just
the right mix of cynicism, warmth, insecurity and humour to be the 
movie's
only endearing character.  Eric Roberts as Bubba Rocque, always 
believable
as the woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box (see FINAL ANALYSIS,
coincidentally also directed by Phil Joanou) is believable here as the
woman-abusing bad guy who knows how to box.  And lest we forget Teri
Hatcher's role in all this, this being her rather well-publicised paid
vacation from playing Lois Lane on TV's "Adventures of Lois & Clark"...
she is totally ridiculous as Rocque's manipulative and seductive Cajun
wife, coming across as devious as a mildly disgruntled au pair who's
trying to get back at an employer who hasn't been giving her enough days
off.  It's probably safe to say that her day job beckons.  And at the end
of our day, none of this is really worth 2 hrs and 12 minutes of our
personal misery.

Review for Craft, The (1996)
Directed by: Andrew Flewing
Cast: Robin Tunney (Sarah), Fairuza Balk (Nancy), Neve Campbell (Bonnie), Rachel True

BEVERLY HILLS 90210 MEETS THE NECRONOMICON
The place is ivy-hung and haunted St. Benedict's High (well, I
guess it looks like any other American high school, but then evil's always
on the inside, isn't it?).  It is where Nancy, Rochelle and Bonnie hold
coven against a brutal society of whitebread prom queens and macho jerks.
They're wannabe witches, with their candles, incense and incantations, all
perky breasts and black eyeliner.  They're also ostracized and made fun of
by their snooty SoCal classmates... you know how cruel kids can be about
your hairstyle/skin colour/family background.  But all that changes when
new girl on the block Sarah (Robin Tunney), a "natural witch", is drawn to
them and they discover that together they can call upon a primeval,
supernatural entity to fulfill their wishes.  Uh oh... you know what's
going to happen to those snooty classmates now, don't you?  From scenes of
the ensuing hairloss and humiliation of their clean-cut, pearly-toothed
tormentors, cut to one of our hexy, sexy heroines strutting smugly through
school, suitably hip rock music playing in the background.
Soon enough though, when Nancy (Fairuza Balk) decides that they
should "invoke the spirit", all this happily dysfunctional adolescent
bitchcraft gives way to maledictions of grimer, more potentially earth-
threatening proportions... suffice it to say that whales get killed in the
process.  Not funny at all.  From this point on, to the predictable
show-down between good and evil (a contrite Sarah against an increasingly
twisted Nancy), the only things to watch out for are Fairuza Balk and a
few nifty special effects.  Fairuza Balk (also in THE ISLAND OF DR.
MOREAU) plays the proud but confused Nancy who needs to prove herself to
the world by demanding all the power in it.  She is by turns pathetically
attention-seeking and cruelly malicious, and remains the only believable
character even when she becomes irredeemably diabolical and psychotic.
The penultimate scene where she stalks Sarah through her house is the only
one that is truly eerie, and not because of the inclusion of buckets of
snakes and bugs.
If THE CRAFT was meant to be a scary movie, then it's so only because it 
could have been a cross between THE LOST BOYS and HEATHERS but turns 
out not even close to either of them. It's informed by occult 
references (the movie has a Wiccan priestess as a consultant for
crying out loud), yet fails to be subtle or original about them.  It has
the trappings of a stylish teen satire, yet ends on a humourlessly banal
note.  And it's altogether just too damn serious by half.  What it does
have is a first-rate performance by Fairuza Balk, a great soundtrack, and
enough visually impressive scenes to make a cool music video.  Good enough
for you, I suppose, if you're a trendy, Magic-playing person who always
wanted to be a witch.  But me and the tea leaves are against this one. 
Gerald Tan used to belong to the Magical Order of Dagon, but quit when
they couldn't get him a car.  He now belongs to the Cynical Order of
Dependent Twentysomethings.

 * Wait for the TV2 broadcast.
 ** A little creaky, but still better than staying at home with Gotcha! 
 *** Pretty good, bring a friend.
 **** Amazing, potent stuff.
 ***** Perfection. See it twice.

Title
Review for She's the One (1996)
Directed by: Edward Burns
Written by: Edward Burns
Cast: Jennifer Aniston (Renee), Maxine Bahns (Hope), Edward Burns 
(Mickey Fitzpatrick), Cameron Diaz (Heather Davis), John Mahoney (Mr 
Fitzpatrick), Mike McGlone (Francis Fitzpatrick)
Produced by: Fox Searchlight Pictures
Music: Tom Petty
Running Time: 96 minutes
Rating: ** out *****
A romantic comedy about Irish Catholic brothers living in New York
with skewed life philosophies, screwing up their relationships with 
women. With a $25,000 budget and a bunch of unknown actors, Edward Burns 
wrote, directed and starred in this movie last year and called it THE 
BROTHERS MCMULLEN.  This year, with a $3 million budget and some big 
name stars, he's done the same story and called it SHE'S THE ONE.  The 
first movie was a little home-made masterpiece that charmed with its 
fault-ridden but likeable characters, cynically witty but not smart-ass 
script, and fine acting all around.  SHE'S THE ONE, on the other hand, 
is just a waste of good Tom Petty music.  As Irish Catholic brothers 
who've screwed up their love lives must be wont to say, "What the hell 
went wrong?"
Ostensibly, the story is about the brothers Fitzpatrick, their
women, and their gruff but well-meaning father.  Mickey (Burns) is the
karmically damaged elder brother who after discovering his former fiance
Heather (Cameron Diaz) in bed with another man, gives up on life and
becomes a taxi cab driver, to the disgust of his brother Francis (Mike
McGlone).  
Francis is a successful but discontented Wall Street executive who
is neurotically competitive about everything and doesn't want to have
sex with his wife (Jennifer Aniston) because he rationalizes that it
would be like cheating on his mistress, who happens to be his brother's
ex-fiance Heather.  And as if things weren't bad enough for them, they
also have to cope with their father (John Mahoney, FRASIER's dad on TV),
a veritable font of bad advice and confused logic, and Hope (Maxine
Bahns - Burns' girlfriend in THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN, Burns' girlfriend in
real life), Mickey's new girlfriend, a suspiciously romantic waif who
marries him the day after she meets him, while neglecting to tell him
that she intends to leave for Paris in a few weeks.
Emotional chaos erupts when Mickey finds out about Francis's
affair with Heather, gets mad with him, has second thoughts about his
marriage to Hope, who gets mad at Mickey for getting mad at Francis,
Francis asks Renee for a divorce and proposes to Heather.  Everybody
pretty much gets on each other's nerves and they will get on yours too,
with their self-absorbed whingeing.  
The plot loses both cohesion and momentum about midways through the
show, and if you start losing interest, you might end up hanging on to
the running series of peurile jokes revolving around Francis's
preoccupation with his sexual abilities.  But even on this you'll find
yourself shortchanged because the people on the Board of Film Censorship
have really butchered this one, as according to their own nefarious and
unknowable tenets (the film has a PG-13 rating in America).
If SHE'S THE ONE, like THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN before it is meant to
tell us anything, it is that men, given any event in life more
complicated than drinking beer, fishing with dad, and smoking cigars,
will invariably and without exception act like morons, but forgive them
anyway because they don't know any better.
But while THE BROTHERS MCMULLEN worked because the characters were
believably hung up, and the humour was situational rather than
gag-oriented, SHE'S THE ONE rings hollowly to the very end.  It's mix of
cheap cariactures, smug jokes, smarmy romance and unlikely coincidences
is grating more than anything else.  The final scene, one of the
Fitzpatrick's ritual fishing trips, where Daddy Fitzpatrick lifts the
"no women onboard" rule on his boat to get Mickey and Hope to make up so
that we can have a happy ending is wincingly twee but thankfully brief.
And for those of you who want to watch this show because of
"Friends" star Jennifer Aniston's "debut" performance, you might like to
know that she was previously in a movie called THE LEPRECHAUN, which was
good enough to be a reference in WAYNE'S WORLD II.
